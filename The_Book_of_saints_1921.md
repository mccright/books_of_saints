PREFACE.  

Mention  of  the  Saints  of  the  Catholic  Church  very  frequently  occurs both  in  general  reading  and  as  having  given  their  names  to  churches, towns,  villages  and  topographical  features.  The  object  of  this  compilation is  to  enable  the  personage  referred  to  readily  to  be  identified. Nothing  more  is  attempted  in  this  volume.  Of  a  certain  number  of  the Saints  detailed  Lives  have  been  published  in  English.  Of  many  more full  accounts  in  other  languages,  particularly  in  French  and  Italian,  are easily  accessible.  Again,  there  are  several  good  and  reliable  Series  of Lives  of  the  more  prominent  Saints.  The  best  known  of  these  to  Englishspeaking  people  is  Alban  Butler's  Lives  of  the  Saints,  an  eighteenth  century work  which  has  been  many  times  reprinted.  In  no  language,  however, does  there  exist  any  exhaustive  work  of  the  kind  ;  nor  in  the  nature  of things  can  there  be.  The  nearest  approach  thereto  we  have  is  the  Latin "  Acta  Sanctorum  "  of  the  Bollandists,  a  body  of  Jesuit  Fathers  gathered together  in  Belgium  for  the  special  purpose  of  carefully  sifting  and  reproducing all  documents  bearing  historically  on  the  life  and  cultus  after death  of  each  individual  Saint.  Of  their  work,  begun  in  the  seventeenth century  by  a  certain  Father  Bolland,  nearly  seventy  huge  folio  volumes have  appeared.  It  is  still  far  from  complete,  and  on  account  of  the results  of  modern  historical  research  in  many  places  needs  development and  extensive  revision.  Moreover,  of  no  small  number  of  canonised Saints  no  record  at  all  now  remains.  We  have  to  be  content  with  proof that  in  bygone  times  they  were  popularly  honoured  as  Saints,  and  by  the Church  formally  recognised  as  such.  Nor  is  it  even  possible  to  estimate the  number  of  God's  servants  whom  the  Church  has  at  one  place  or another  venerated  as  Saints.  In  the  first  Ages  of  Christianity  canonisation was  effected  in  each  country  by  the  joint  act  of  one  or  more  Bishops and  their  people.  Of  this  act  they  left  as  a  rule  sufficient  testimony  by dedicating  a  church  in  honour  of  the  new  Saint,  whose  name  it  thenceforth bore,  and  by  instituting  an  annual  festival  in  his  honour.  From  about the  eleventh  century  the  procedure  began  to  be  systemised  and  centralised, with  the  result  that  canonising  is  now  reserved  exclusively  to  the  Holy See.  The  legislation  of  Pope  Alexander  III  in  the  twelfth  century  and  of Urban  VIII  in  the  seventeenth  has  firmly  established  this  principle.  

The  present  process  of  Canonisation  is  exceedingly  complex.  It consists  in  the  first  place  of  a  thorough  investigation  into  all  the  particulars that  can  be  ascertained  of  the  life  and  death  of  the  alleged  Saint,  all  facts connected  with  whose  career,  both  public  and  private,  together  with  all his  utterances  and  writings,  are  tested  in  every  way.  He  must  be  shown to  have  been  God-fearing,  pious,  just  in  his  dealings,  patient,  self-denying, charitable,  and  so  on,  far  above  the  average  of  ordinary  good  men.  In this,  as  in  all  subsequent  stages  of  the  procedure,  every  witness  is  examined under  oath  and  in  the  presence  of  a  trained  Church  lawyer,  who  is  obliged to  urge  all  the  objections  he  can  think  of,  and  who  is  at  liberty  not  only to  cross-examine  the  witnesses  put  forward  but  to  call  any  number  of others  he  pleases  in  order  to  rebut  their  testimony.  Supposing  the judgment  of  the  Court  of  First  Instance  to  be  favourable,  the  case  goes for  retrial  to  a  higher  tribunal.  In  these  proceedings  not  only  are  witnesses called  to  testify  to  individual  facts,  but  particular  stress  is  put  upon the  popular  verdict  concerning  the  alleged  Saint,  that  is,  upon  the  repute in  which  he  was  held  by  those  who  may  have  had  dealings  with  him  or had  opportunities  of  forming  an  opinion  about  him.  Depositions  of  all kinds  must  be  gathered  together  with  as  little  delay  as  possible,  and  duly sworn  to  ;  but  in  order  to  guard  against  mere  enthusiasm  playing  any part  in  the  matter,  at  one  stage  of  the  proceedings  a  surcease  of  at  least ten  years  is  enjoined.  

The  above  official  enquiry  into  the  conduct  in  life  and  virtues  of  the deceased  Christian  for  whom  the  supreme  honour  of  canonisation  is claimed  is  deemed  unnecessary  only  in  the  case  of  a  Martyr,  that  is, of  one  of  the  Faithful  who  has  deliberately  laid  down  his  life  rather  than deny  Christ.  In  his  case  it  has  to  be  fully  proved  that  he  was  put  to death  on  account  of  his  religion,  and  not  because  he  was  guilty  of  some political  or  other  crime,  true  or  only  alleged.  

Canonisation  is  the  official  recognition  by  the  Church  of  the  fact  that one  of  her  children  has  won  his  place  in  Heaven  ;  and  since  Almighty God  alone  can  make  known  this  fact  to  mankind  every  canonisation essentially  depends  on  proof  that  miracles  have  been  wrought  in  witness thereto.  It  must  be  shown  that  because  of  the  alleged  Saint  the  laws  of Nature  have  by  Almighty  God  in  some  particular  instances  been  overruled. This,  from  the  circumstances  of  the  happening,  may  well  bear  testimony to  the  fact,  otherwise  unascertainable,  that  a  servant  of  God  deceased is  already  among  those  who  in  the  glory  of  Heaven  are  yet  mindful  of their  fellow-creatures  on  earth,  and  are  interceding  with  God  on  their behalf.  Among  the  miracles  required  for  a  canonisation  are  such  wonders as  the  giving  sight  to  the  blind,  hearing  to  the  deaf,  instantaneous  healing of  the  sick,  raising  of  the  dead  to  life,  the  very  wonders  wrought  by Christ  and  His  disciples  in  proof  of  the  truth  of  the  revelation  they  announced to  mankind.  Clear  proof  of  at  least  four  miracles  is  required as  a  condition  of  canonisation.  It  must  be  shown  in  each  case  that  the fact  alleged  as  miraculous  has  really  taken  place,  that  it  cannot  be  explained away  or  attributed  to  any  natural  cause,  and  that  the  miracle directly  followed  upon  an  appeal  made  to  Almighty  God  through  His servant  departed  this  life.  All  possible  objections  are  freely  urged  and have  to  be  fully  answered.  In  cases  of  alleged  miraculous  healing  of  the sick  competent  medical  experts  are  called  in  and  all  theories  advanced by  them  patiently  discussed.  It  cannot  be  wondered  at  that  a  great number  of  alleged  miracles,  perhaps  the  major  part,  are  rejected,  the limits  of  the  powers  of  Nature  being  so  little  known  to  us  and  so  great allowance  having  to  be  made  for  the  play  of  imagination,  and  for  what there  may  be  of  truth  in  processes  of  purely  natural  "  Faith-healing."

Usually,  the  procedure  in  Causes  of  canonisation  takes  many  years to  complete  ;  for  there  are  numerous  hearings  and  rehearings  to  be allowed  for.  A  first  stage  is  that  of  "  Beatification,"  which  is  reached on  proof  of  extraordinary  holiness  of  life  and  of  two  miracles.  In  modern procedure  this  is  rarely  reached  within  fifty  years  of  the  death  of  the Saint.  At  Beatification,  permission  is  given  for  local  veneration.  For Canonisation  proper,  proof  of  two  more  miracles  wrought  since  Beatification is  demanded.  The  Servant  of  God  is  then  enrolled  in  the  Canon  of Saints,  his  or  her  name  being  inserted  in  the  Roman  Martyrology  or official  catalogue  of  Saints  proposed  to  the  veneration  of  the  Universal Church.  

The  Roman  Martyrology  contains  about  five  thousand  entries  ; but  in  the  case  of  the  Martyrs  of  the  first  centuries  of  Christianity,  they often  appear  in  groups,  the  name  of  only  the  leaders  of  each  band  of heroes  being  registered.  It  is  impossible  to  reckon  up  the  number  of holy  men  and  women  reputed  and  locally  honoured  as  Saints  in  various places  during  the  many  ages  which  preceded  the  formulating  the  minute rules  for  the  Process  of  Canonisation  which  have  obtained  for  the  last few  centuries.  In  many  instances  the  claims  of  those  commonly  and from  early  times  styled  Saints  have  in  modern  times  been  officially  enquired into  with  the  result  that  their  cultus  has  been  sanctioned  ;  in  others, as,  for  example,  that  of  the  famous  Christian  writer,  Clement  of  Alexandria, who  flourished  and  died  about  a.d.  216,  the  claim  has  been  disallowed. This  does  not  mean  that  the  Church  condemns  or  repudiates  the  individual ;  but  only  that  She  has  no  proof  that  he  was  a  Saint  in  the  strict sense  of  the  word.  

But  there  are  many  hundreds  of  "  Saints  "  whose  claims  to  that  title rest  on  the  traditional  veneration  accorded  them  from  ancient  times,  and witnessed  to  in  many  cases  by  the  Dedication  of  churches  in  their  honour, but  of  the  legitimacy  of  whose  canonisation,  from  dearth  of  documents or  for  other  reason,  no  proof  is  now  extant.  These  remain  with  that recognition  only  which  was  given  them  by  the  ancient  Bishops  and peoples,  their  contemporaries,  but  with  a  strict  prohibition  of  any  extension of  their  cultus.  

Although  the  scope  of  this  book  of  reference  only  admits  of  the  cataloguing of  Saints  of  some  prominence,  an  endeavour  has  been  made  to include,  in  addition  to  the  Saints  of  the  Roman  Martyrology,  all  others generally  known,  at  least  by  name,  especially  those  who  have  given  placenames  to  towns  or  villages  in  the  British  Isles.  

Liturgically,  Saints  are  classified  as  Apostles,  Martyrs,  Bishops  or Confessors  (Saints  who  were  neither  Bishops  nor  Martyrs)  ;  similarly female  Saints  are  Martyrs,  Virgins,  Widows,  Penitents,  etc.  These designations  have  been  added  (as  far  as  needful)  in  every  instance.  

In  regard  to  the  more  ancient  Saints,  considerable  difficulty  is  often occasioned  by  the  varying  spelling  of  the  Saint's  name.  Certain  names indeed  are  at  first  sight  all  but  unrecognisable.  St.  Olaus  or  Olave corrupted  into  Tooley,  and  St.  Vedast  written  Foster,  are  examples.  

Again,  the  early  converts  to  Christianity  often  changed  their  names on  receiving  Baptism.  Saul  of  Tarsus,  our  St.  Paul,  at  once  occurs  to the  mind.  The  new  names  assumed  were  ordinarily  Greek  or  Latin nouns  significant  of  some  virtue  or  quality.  Hence,  the  countless  SS. Eusebius,  Victor,  Justus,  Probus,  etc.  Later  too,  when  Christianity spread  among  the  then  Barbarians  of  Northern  and  Western  Europe, for  Teutonic  and  Celtic  appellations  Latin  forms  were  frequently  substituted. Thus  the  Anglo-Saxon  Winfried  is  the  famous  St.  Boniface, Apostle  of  Germany.  

From  confusion  of  names  have  arisen  difficulties  and  uncertainties  in distinguishing  the  early  Saints,  when  more  or  less  contemporaries,  the one  from  the  other,  and  frequent  mistakes  made  by  Mediaeval  biographers. We  find  at  times  a  single  happening  attributed  by  one  writer  to  one Saint  and  by  another  writer  to  another  Saint  of  the  same  or  similar  name  ; and  on  the  other  hand  a  personage  with  two  names  is  at  times  presented to  us  as  two  distinct  individuals.  But  in  the  accounts  we  have  of  Saints who  have  lived  within  the  last  thousand  years  these  errors  scarcely  occur, and  the  official  or  approved  Lives  of  Saints  of  the  Middle  Ages  and  of modern  times  may  be  taken  as  substantially  accurate.  

As  the  present  compilation  aims  at  no  more  than  the  stretching  of the  historical  framework  of  a  Saint's  life,  the  sifting  of  the  details  elaborated by  the  chroniclers  of  the  old  legends  does  not  occur.  Similarly,  it  has not  been  deemed  necessary  specially  to  particularise  the  miracles  which in  every  case  have  borne  witness  to  the  holy  man  or  woman's  right  to a  place  in  a  catalogue  of  Saints.  In  the  main  (as  stated  above)  these miracles  are  of  the  kind  performed  by  our  Blessed  Lord  and  his  Apostles. Their  occurrence  from  time  to  time  was  foretold  by  Him  :  :'  They  shall cast  out  devils.  They  shall  speak  with  new  tongues.  They  shall  take up  serpents  ;  and  if  they  shall  drink  any  deadly  thing,  it  shall  not  hurt them.  They  shall  lay  their  hands  on  the  sick  and  they  shall  recover  " (Mark  xvi.  17,  18).  Or  again,  the  supernatural  power  abides  in  their earthly  remains  :  "  They  cast  the  body  into  the  sepulchre  of  Eliseus. And  when  it  had  touched  the  bones  of  Eliseus,  the  man  came  to  life  and stood  upon  his  feet  "  (4  Kings  xiii.  21).  Wonders  like  to  this  last  take place  in  the  twentieth  century,  even  as  they  did  in  past  ages  ;  and  they justify  the  veneration  which  the  Catholic  Church  teaches  her  children to  be  due  to  the  relics  of  God's  Saints.  

In  the  Lives  of  the  Saints,  fulfilments  of  Christ's  prophecy  are  frequently recorded  either  as  effected  by  the  Saint  himself  in  life  or  as occurring  after  his  death  in  response  to  a  call  upon  him  for  help.  

Lastly,  in  going  over  one  by  one  the  names  of  Saints  specially  and publicly  venerated  as  such  by  the  Church  of  God  on  earth,  it  must  never be  forgotten  that  they  form  but  a  small  proportion  of  the  "  great  multitude which  no  man  can  number  of  all  nations  and  tribes  and  peoples  and tongues,  standing  before  the  throne  and  in  sight  of  the  Lamb,  clothed with  white  robes  and  palms  in  their  hands  "  (Apoc.  vii.  9).  We  rely  on the  intercession  of  all  the  Blessed  in  Heaven,  for  "  the  prayers  of  all are  offered,  upon  the  golden  Altar  which  is  before  the  throne  of  God  " (Apoc.  viii.  3).

A 

♦AARON  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  21)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Briton  who  crossing  into Armorica  (Bretagne)  founded  a  monastery  in an  island  called  after  him,  until  in  the  twelfth century  it  took  the  name  of  St.  Malo,  St. Aaron's  most  famous  disciple.  

AARON  (St.)  M.  (July  1)  
See  SS.  JULIUS  and  AAKON.  

AARON  (St.)  High  Priest  of  the  Old  Law.  (July  1) (15th  cent.  B.C.)  The  great  grandson  of Levi,  son  of  Jacob,  and  the  first  of  the  Jewish High  Priests,  to  which  office  he  was  appointed by  God  Himself.  He  was  the  brother  of Moses,  the  Hebrew  Lawgiver,  with  whom  he shared  the  leadership  of  the  people  of  Israel. Like  Moses,  he  never  entered  the  land  of Promise  ;  but  died  on  Mount  Hor,  on  the borders  of  Edom.  He  was  succeeded  by  his son  Eliezer  (B.C.  1471)  In  art  he  is  represented with  a  rod  in  flower,  a  censer  and  a  Jewish mitre.  The  Book  of  Exodus  contains  all  that we  know  concerning  him.  

ABACHUM  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  19)  
See  SS.  MARIS,  AUDIFAX,  &c.  

♦ABB  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  25)  
Otherwise  St.  EBB  A,  which  see.  

♦ABBAN  of  KILL-ABBAN  (St.)  Abbot. (Mch.  16)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  contemporary of  St.  Patrick  and  nephew  of  St.  Ibar.  He was  the  Founder  of  Kill-Abban  Abbey  (Leinster)  

♦ABBAN  of  MAGH-ARMUIDHE  (St.)  (Oct.  27)  Abbot.  
(6th  cent.)  A  nephew  of  St.  Kevin,  and Founder  of  many  monasteries,  mostly  in  the South  of  Ireland.  Butler  and  others  confuse the  two  Saints  Abban.  Of  neither  have we  reliable  Lives.  

♦ABBO  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  13)  
(10th  cent.)  A  French  Benedictine  monk of  literary  attainments  rare  in  the  age  in  which he  lived,  who  was  invited  by  St.  Oswald  of Worcester  to  preside  over  the  community  he had  founded  at  Ramsey  Abbey.  After  the death  of  St.  Oswald  St.  Abbo  returned  to France  and  became  Abbot  of  Fleury  on  the Loire.  He  afterwards  conducted  skilfully  and successfully  various  negotiations  between  the Holy  See  and  the  King  of  France.  He lost his life while endeavouring to stop a riot (a.d. 1004), and by his people was at once honoured as a Martyr. 

ABDAS  (St.)  M.  (May  16)  
Otherwise  St.  AUDAS,  which  see.  

ABDECALAS  (St.)  M.  (April  21)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Persian  of  advanced  age  who, together  with  another  priest,  St.  Ananias, and  about  a  hundred  Christians,  was  a  fellowsufferer  with  St.  Simeon,  Archbishop  of Seleucia  and  Ctesiphon,  under  the  tyrant  King Sapor  II.  They  were  put  to  death  as  Christians on  Good  Friday,  A.d.  345.  The  Greek  historian Sozomen  reckons  at  sixteen  thousand  the number  of  the  Faithful  in  Persia  who  laid down  their  lives  for  Christ  during  the  forty years  of  the  reign  of  Sapor.  

ABDIAS  (OBADIAH)  (St.)  Prophet.  (Nov.  19) (9th  cent.  B.C.)  Abdis  (Servant  of  the  Lord) is  the  fourth  of  the  twelve  minor  prophets,  and is  generally  supposed  to  have  been  a  contemporary of  Osee  (Hosea),  Joel  and  Amos.  But some  identify  him  with  Achab's  steward  (3 Kings,  xviii.  3),  making  him  much  more ancient.  His  prophetic  writings  are  short  and are  contained  in  a  single  chapter  of  twenty-five verses.  He  foretells  the  destruction  of  Edom on  account  of  the  pride  of  the  Idumaeans  and of  the  wrongs  they  had  done  to  the  Jews.  

ABDIESUS  (HEBEDJESUS)  (St.)  M.  (April  22) (4th  cent.)  Styled  a  deacon  in  the  Roman Martyrology,  he  was  one  of  the  vast  multitude of  Persians  (named  and  unnamed),  who  by  the savage  edict  of  their  King  Sapor  were  called  to the  crown  of  martyrdom.  This  persecution raged  from  A.D.  341  to  a.d.  380,  that  is,  at intervals  during  the  last  forty  years  of  Sapor's reign.  

ABDON  and  SENNEN  (SS.)  MM.  (July  30)  
(3rd  cent.)  Two  Persian  nobles  who,  coming to  Rome,  or  rather  brought  thither  as captives  by  Decius,  when  returning  from  his first  successful  campaign  against  the  Persians, under  the  Emperor  Gordian,  devoted  themselves to  the  service  of  the  imprisoned  Christians and  to  the  reverent  interring  of  the  bodies  of the  Martyrs.  They  were  themselves  thrown to  the  wild  beasts  in  the  Amphitheatre  in  the persecution  decreed  by  Decius  when  he  became Emperor  (a.d.  250).  They  were  long  gratefully remembered  by  the  Christians  of  Rome and  are  still  annually  commemorated  in  the Liturgy  of  the  Church.  The  details  given concerning  them  in  the  otherwise  doubtful Acts  of  St.  Laurence  the  Martyr,  their  contemporary, seem  fairly  trustworthy.  

♦ABEL  (Thomas)  (St.)  M.  (July  30)  

See  Bl.  THOMAS  ABEL. A  1 

ABERCIUS 
ABERCIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  22)  
(2nd  cent.)  Bishop  of  Hierapolis  in  Phrygia (Asia  Minor)  in  which  See  he  is  reported  to have  succeeded  the  famous  Papias.  He  was zealous  against  Paganism,  and  appears  to  have suffered  imprisonment  on  that  account  under the  philosophic  Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius. But  a  miracle  wrought  by  him  in  favour  of  her daughter  secured  him  the  protection  of  the Empress  Faustina,  and  he  returned  to  die  in peace  at  Hierapolis  (about  a.d.  167),  after following  on  his  journeys  one  of  the  routes traced  out  by  the  Apostle  St.  Paul,  everywhere preaching,  baptising  and  healing  the  sick. His  epitaph,  composed  by  himself,  discovered in  1882  and  now  in  the  Vatican  Museum,  is one  of  the  most  interesting  Christian  monuments of  the  second  century.  

ABIBO  (ABIBAS)  (St.)  Conf.  (Aug.  3)  
(1st  cent.)  The  second  son  of  Gamaliel (Acts  v.  24  ;  xxii.  3),  at  whose  feet  St.  Paul had  sat.  Following  his  father's  example,  he embraced  the  Christian  Faith  and  lived  an unsullied  life  to  his  eightieth  year.  His body  was  buried  near  that  of  St.  Stephen,  the First  Martyr,  at  Capergamela,  a  town  distant about  twenty  miles  from  Jerusalem.  The Church  commemorates  annually  the  anniversary (Aug.  3)  of  the  Finding  (A.D.  415)  of the  bodies  of  the  four  Saints,  Stephen,  Gamaliel, Nicodemus  and  Abibo,  there  interred.  

ABIBUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  at  Edessa  in  Syria under  the  Emperor  Licinius  (a.d.  316).  He was  burned  to  death  at  the  stake.  

ABILIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  22)  
(First  cent.)  The  third  Bishop,  in  succession to  SS.  Mark  and  Anianus,  of  Alexandria in  Egypt,  to  which  See  he  was  advanced A.D.  84,  and  over  which  he  presided  for  thirteen years.  The  particulars  of  his  life  and  Episcopate have  been  lost.  

♦ABRA  (ABRE)  (St.)  V.  (Dec.  13)  
(4th  cent.)  A  daughter  of  St.  Hilary  of Poitiers,  born  before  his  father's  conversion. Following  her  father's  advice,  she  consecrated herself  to  God  as  a  nun  ;  but  died  (a.d.  361) when  only  in  her  eighteenth  year.  

♦ABRAHAM  (ABRAAMIUS)  (St.)  Bp.  M  (Feb.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  Bishop  of  Abela  in  Assyria, a  place  famous  for  the  victory  there  of  Alexander the  Great  over  the  Persians.  St. Abraham  was  put  to  death  (a.d.  348)  by  the persecuting  King  Sapor  II.  

♦ABRAHAM  (ABRAAMES)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  14)  
(5th  cent.)  A  famous  Solitary  of  Mount Lebanon,  who,  as  Bishop  of  Carrhes  (Charan), showed  himself  a  zealous  pastor  of  souls  and, later,  did  much  work  useful  to  the  Church  at the  Court  of  the  Emperor  Theodosius  the Younger. He  died  at  Constantinople,  a.d.  422.  

ABRAHAM  (St.)  Conf.  (March  16)  
(4th  cent.)  A  hermit  of  Edessa  and  native of  Chidana  in  Mesopotamia,  famous  for  his austerity  of  life,  for  his  fruitful  preaching  and for  the  miraculous  conversion  of  his  niece, venerated  with  him  as  St.  Mary.  His  life  was written  by  St.  Ephrem  and  he  is  honoured  in all  the  Liturgies.  He  died  about  A.D.  360. .  

ABRAHAM  (St.)  Conf.  (June  18)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Syrian  Saint  who  on  a  journey to  Egypt  to  visit  the  Solitaries  of  the  desert  was seized  by  a  band  of  robbers  and  remained  five years  in  bonds.  He  succeeded  in  the  end  in escaping  and  making  his  way  to  the  coast. There  he  boarded  a  ship  bound  for  Gaul,  where he  settled  near  Clermont  in  Auvergne.  Numerous disciples  gathered  round  him  for  whom  he built  a  monastery.  He  died,  famous  for miracles,  a.d.  472.  

ABRAHAM  (St.)  Patriarch.  (Oct.  9)  
(19th  and  20th  cent.  B.C.) The  Father  of  all 
believers,  and  the  progenitor,  according  to  the 
flesh,  of  the  Hebrew  nation.  He  is  also  the 
father  of  Ismael,  from  whom  the  Ismaelites  or 

Arabs  are  descended.  When  seventy  years  of age,  he  went  forth  from  Babylonia,  his  native land,  at  God's  bidding,  to  dwell  henceforth  in Canaan,  the  land  flowing  with  milk  and  honey promised  to  his  seed.  There,  he  led  a  pastoral and  nomad  life.  Moreover,  God  made  a covenant  with  him,  changing  his  name  from Abram  to  Abraham  (Father  of  nations),  promising at  the  same  time  that  his  descendants should  be  more  numerous  than  the  stars  of Heaven  and  that  in  his  seed  all  peoples  should be  blessed.  Of  him  Our  Lord  said  :  "  Abraham rejoiced  that  he  might  see  my  day  ;  He  saw  it and  was  glad  "  (John  viii.  56).  All  through their  eventful  history  it  was  the  glory  of  the Jewish  people  to  claim  descent  from  him  and from  his  son  and  grandson,  Isaac  and  Jacob. To  them,  in  words  spoken  to  Moses  (Exod.  iii. 6),  God  was  the  God  of  Abraham,  Isaac  and Jacob.  The  Patriarch  died  in  Palestine  at  the age  of  one  hundred  and  seventy-five  years (B.C.  1821).  These  and  similar  Old  Testament dates  are  given  according  to  the  traditional Chronology  ;  but  are  still  disputed.

ABUNDIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  2)  
(5th  cent.)  A  celebrated  Bishop  of  Como  in North  Italy,  charged  by  Pope  St.  Leo  the  Great with  the  important  mission  to  the  Emperor Theodosius  the  Younger  which  resulted  in  the convocation  of  the  great  Council  of  Chalcedon (a.d.  451)  and  in  the  final  condemnation  of  the heresiarch  Eutyches,  who  denied  the  two-fold Nature  of  Christ  God-Man  (whence  his  followers have  their  name  of  Monophysites — assertors of  One  Nature  only).  St.  Abundius  died a.d.  469.  He  is  often  represented  in  art  in  the act  of  raising  a  dead  man  to  life,  one  of  the miracles  he  wrought  and  which  led  to  his enrolment  in  the  catalogue  of  Saints.  

ABUNDIUS  (St.)  Conf.  (April  14)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Sacristan  of  the  Church  of St.  Peter  in  Borne  St.  Gregory  the  Great makes  mention  of  his  humble  but  Divinely favoured  life.  He  is  said  to  have  passed  away about  the  year  564.  

ABUNDIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  11)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Parish  priest  of  a  mountain village  near  Cordova  in  Spain  during  the Moorish  domination.  He  entertained  no  thought of  martyrdom,  but  found  himself  in  the  year 854  suddenly  drawn  into  the  conflict,  and, laying  his  head  on  the  block,  made  a  glorious sacrifice  of  his  lfe  for  the  Christian  Faith.

(3rd  or  4th  cent.)  Abundius,  a  Roman Priest,  and  Abundantius,  his  deacon,  had converted  to  Christianity  Marcian,  a  citizen of  distinction,  by  miraculously  raising  to  life his  son  John.  The  Emperor  Diocletian,  informed of  what  had  happened,  ordered  all  four to  be  beheaded  together,  without  the  walls  of the  Imperial  City.  The  precise  date,  between the  years  274  and  308  is  uncertain.

(3rd  cent.)  Surnamed  Agathangelus  (Good Angel).  A  Bishop  in  Phrygia  (Asia  Minor) who  in  the  Decian  persecution  (a.d.  250)  became famous  for  having  by  his  prudence  and  constancy so  impressed  the  tyrant  as  to  obtain his  discharge  from  custody.  It  is  not  known how  long  he  survived.  He  is  held  in  great veneration  in  the  East.  

ACATHIUS  (St.)  M  (May  8)  
(4th  cent )  A  Christian  centurion  in  the Roman  army,  tortured  and  beheaded  at Constantinople  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  303). Constantine  the  Great  built  a  noble  church in  his  honour.  He  is  the  St.  Agazio  venerated at  Squillace  in  Calabria.

He  seems  to have died (a.d. 740), perhaps in exile, or shortly  after  his  return  to  Hexham.  A  solemn Translation of his relics took place three centuries  later.  St.  Acca  was  certainly  one  of the  most  learned  Anglo-Saxon  prelates  of  his century.

From MSS. in the Vatican and Imperial (Vienna) Libraries, the Bollandists have  published  a  Greek  narrative  of  the  Passion of St. Acindynus and his companions, from which  it  would  appear  that  all  or  nearly  all  of them  were  priests  or  clerics.

ADAL-,  AETHEL-,  AL-,  AU-,  EDIL-,  ETHELAll  these  prefixes  to  names  of  Teutonic  origin are  more  or  less  interchangeable.  Thus,  St. Etheldreda,  St.  Ediltrudis,  St.  Audrey,  are  one and  the  same  personage.  That  which  appears the  more  usual  manner  of  spelling  a  Saint's  name in  English  has,  as  a  rule,  been  followed  in  these pages  in  each  case.  In  Latinising  Proper Names,  mediaeval  writers  usually  substitute  D for  TH,  or  simply  omit  the  H.  So,  the  letter  T, especially  in  terminations,  has  a  tendency  to  be replaced  by  C.  Again,  the  terminations  BERT and  BRIGHT  are  mere  variants.  Thus,  we talk  of  St.  Cuthbert.  but  we  write  Kirkcudbright for  the  town  that  takes  its  appellation  from  him. In  fine,  FRED,  FRIDE,  FRID,  FRIDA, FREDE, &c,  are  undistinguishable.  

♦ADALARDUS (ADELHARDUS, ALARD) (St.) Abbot.  (Jan.  2)  
(9th  cent.)  An  Abbot  of  Corbie  (France), related  to  the  Emperor  Charlemagne  and  one of  his  chief  ministers  and  advisers.  At  one time  he  lost  the  favour  of  that  monarch's  son and  successor,  Louis  the  Pious,  and  was  banished. On  his  return,  he  gave  himself  entirely to  the  discharge  of  his  monastic  duties,  dying at  Corbie,  a.d.  827,  at  the  age  of  seventy-three. During  his  tenure  of  office  he  founded  the  great Abbev  of  New  Corbie  in  Saxony.  

♦ADALBALD  (St.)  Conf.  (Feb.  2)  
(7th  cent.)  A  pious  nobleman  of  the  Court of  King  Clovis  II  of  France.  He  was  the husband  of  St.  Rictrude,  and,  like  their  parents, their  four  children  are  publicly  venerated  as Saints.  St.  Adalbald  was  murdered  while  on a  journey  (A.D.  645),  under  circumstances  which have  led  to  his  being  honoured  in  many  places as  a  Martyr.  

ADALBERT  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  23)  
(10th  cent.)  One  of  the  Patron  Saints  of Bohemia  and  Poland.  A  Bohemian  bv  birth, consecrated  in  his  infancy  to  Our  "Blessed Lady,  he  was  educated  by  Adalbert,  Archbishop of  Magdeburg  and,  on  his  return  to Bohemia,  was  ordained  priest  by  Diethmar, Archbishop  of  Prague,  whom  he  succeeded shortly  afterwards.  Driven  from  Prague,  he retired  for  a  time  to  the  Abbey  of  St.  Boniface in  Rome ;  and  after  vain  efforts  to  re-enter his  own  Diocese,  directed  his  zeal  to  the  conversion of  Hungary,  Poland  and  Prussia.  His missionary  success  was  great,  and  his  labours only  ceased  on  his  receiving  the  crown  of martyrdom  at  Dantzig  (a.d.  997).  

♦ADALSINDIS  (St.)  V. "  (Dec.  24) (8th cent.)  One of the daughters of SS. Adalbald  and  Rictrudis,  who  sanctified  herself in  the  monastery  of  Hamay,  of  which  her  own sister,  St. Eusebia,  was  Abbess.  A.D.  715  is given  as  the  year  of  her  death. 

♦ADAMNAN  (St.)  Conf.  (Jan.  31)  
(7th  cent.)  A  monk  of  Coklingham  Abbey  in the  Saxon  Kingdom  of  Northumbria.  He expiated  by  a  long  life  of  austerities  and  prayer the  sins  of  his  youth,  and  deserved  well  of  the Church  by  co-operating  with  St.  Ebba  in reforming  the  discipline  of  the  convent  which she  had  founded  and  over  which  she  presided to  the  day  of  her  death.  St.  Adamnan  himself passed  away  about  the  vear  679. ADAMNAN  (ADAM)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  6)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Irish  Abbot  of  Iona  in  Scotland— "  a  wise  and  good  man,  well  versed  in the  Holy  Scriptures " — best  known  by  the Life  of  St.  Columba  he  has  left  and  by  a  description of  the  Holy  Places  of  Palestine  which  he compiled.  He  was  remarkable  for  his  success in  procuring  in  Scotland  and  Ireland  the adoption  of  the  Roman  practice  as  to  the  date of  Easter.  He  died  A.D.  704.  Whether  or not  he  is  one  and  the  same  with  St.  Eunan the  Patron  Saint  of  the  Diocese  of  Raphoe  in Ireland,  remains  an  open  question.  His  name has  been  popularly  abbreviated  into  Adam, and  is  still  frequently  given  in  Scotland  at Baptism.  

ADAUCUS  (ADAUCTUS)  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  By  birth  an  Italian,  and  an Imperial  favourite  at  the  Court  of  the  pitiless Diocletian,  who  sacrificed  him  on  discovering his  religion.  He  was  executed  in  Phrygia (A.D.  304),  and  had  a  number  of  companions in  his  Martyrdom,  some  of  M'hom  were  of senatorial  or  other  high  rank.  Among  them there  were  also  manv  women  and  children. Historians  attribute  the  special  barbarity  of the  tortures  he  endured  rather  to  the  savageness of  Galerius,  Diocletian's  colleague,  than  to  the evil  disposition  of  the  old  Emperor  himself.  

ADAUCTUS  (St.)  M.  (July  30)  

See  SS.  FELIX  and  ADAUCTUS.  

ADAUCTUS  and  CALLISTHENE  (SS.)  (Oct.  4) (4th  cent.)  Ephesians,  one  of  whom,  St. Adauctus,  suffered  under  the  tyrant  Maximinus Daza,  about  the  year  312.

(11th  cent.)  The  wife  of  Count  Baldwin  IV of  Flanders  who,  after  her  husband's  death, took  the  veil  at  the  hands  of  Pope  Alexander  II (A.D.  1067)  and  retired  to  the  Benedictine  Abbey of  Messines,  near  Ipres,  where  she  died  a.d. 1071.  

♦ADELA  and  IRMINA  (SS.)  VV.  (Dec.  24)  
(7th  and  8th  cent.)  Two  sisters,  daughters of  Dagobert,  King  of  the  Franks,  for  whom  he founded  a  monastery  at  Treves,  where  their devotedness  to  the  service  of  the  poor  led  to  their being  after  their  deaths  honoured  as  Saints.  

♦ADELAIDE  (ADELHEID)  (St.)  Empress.  (Dec.  16) (10th  cent.)  A  Burgundian  princess,  wife  of Lothaire,  King  of  Italy,  and,  after  his  death and  much  persecution  patiently  endured, married  to  Otho,  Emperor  of  Germany.  She was  an  able  woman  and,  especially  during  her second  widowhood  and  guardianship  of  her grandson,  Otho  III,  rendered  great  services to  Church  and  State,  acting  as  the  Peacemaker of  Europe  in  that  lawless  age.  It  is  said  of St.  Adelaide  that  "  she  never  forgot  a  kindness, nor  ever  remembered  an  injury."  In  the  end she  retired  to  a  monastery  in  Alsace,  where  she died  A.D.  999.

♦ADELELMUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  30)  
(11th  cent.)  A  French  monk,  who,  having given  great  proofs  of  skill  and  piety  in  the  government of  his  Abbey  was  called  to  Spain  by  King Alphonsus  V  and  there  re-established  good order  and  monastic  discipline  in  the  monasteries committed  to  his  charge.

(5th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Rufus  in the  See  of  Metz,  which  Diocese  he  governed  for seventeen  years,  converting  many  pagans  to Christianity.  But  nothing  certain  concerning him  is  known  ;  and  it  is  only  conjeeturally  that he  is  dated  in  the  fifth  century.  His  cultus  at Metz  from  early  ages  is,  however,  indisputable  ; and  the  Solemn  Translation  of  his  relics  to Neuweiler  in  Alsace  in  the  ninth  century  was the  occasion  of  great  popular  rejoicings.  

ADEODATUS. Saints  of  this  name  are  better  known  as DEUSDEDIT  or  DIEUDONNE  (God-Given).  

ADERITUS  (ABDERITUS,  ADERY)  (St.)  Bp.

No  reliable  account  of  his  life  now exists.  His  body,  originally  buried  outside the  walls  of  Ravenna,  was  in  the  Middle  Ages enshrined  in  one  of  the  chief  churches  of  the city.

ADJUTUS  (St.)  Conf.  (Dec.  19)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Described  as  Abbot  of Orleans  and  often  assigned  to  as  early  as  the fifth  century.  He  is  inscribed  as  ADJUTUS in  the  Roman  Martyrology  ;  but  French  authors mostly  style  him  AVITUS  or  AVY.  The learned  Mabillon  holds,  in  accordance  with Baronius,  that  there  were  really  two  Abbots of  this  name  in  the  Orleanais,  the  one  of  Perche, the  other  of  Micy,  both  honoured  as  Saints. Neither  of  course  must  be  confused  with  the much  better  known  St  Avitus,  Bishop  of Vienne,  who  flourished  at  about  the  same period.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  St.  Gregory  of Tours,  a  thousand  years  before  Mabillon.  had distinguished  one  from  the  other,  the  two holy  Abbots.  Nevertheless,  the  modern  compilers of  the  Analecta  Bollandiana,  adopting the  seventeenth  century  criticisms  of  Ruinart, insist  that  the  earlier  MSS.  know  of  only  one Abbot  Adjutus,  or  Avitus,  recognised  as  a  Saint in  the  fifth,  sixth  or  seventh  century.  This would  be  the  St.  Avitus,  Abbot,  of  June  17) Various  developments  of  his  legend  have (they  contend)  led  to  the  mistake.  Krusch ventures  the  suggestion  that  two  festivals  were locally  kept  in  his  honour,  one  (Dec.  19)  commemorating his  death, the other (June 17)

the Translation at  some  later  period of  his relics. ADO  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  16)  
(9th  cent.)  Born  in  Burgundy  of  rich  and noble  parents  (a.d.  799),  St.  Ado  was  educated in  the  Benedictine  Abbey  of  Ferrieres  in  the Diocese  of  Sens.  Ordained  priest,  he  taught sacred  and  profane  science  in  the  Schools  of the  Abbey  of  Brum,  near  Treves.  He  next spent  four  years  in  Rome,  engaged  in  literary researches,  and  returning  to  France,  discovered at  Ravenna  much  important  material  from which  he  published  his  famous  Martyrology. He  worked  on  this  at  Lyons  as  the  guest  of St.  Remigius,  Archbishop  of  that  city.  On  the death  of  Agilmar,  Archbishop  of  Vienne  in Dauphine,  St.  Ado  was  consecrated  his  successor and  received  the  Ballium  from  Fope Nicholas  I.  He  died  in  the  year  875.  In  art, he  is  usually  represented  studying  the  Scriptures in  a  library.  Besides  the  Martyrology.  we  have several  others  of  his  writings.  Ado's  Martyrology has  largely  influenced  the  compilers  of  later revisions  of  the  Roman  Martyrology  itself,  and full  account  must  therefore  in  the  study  of  the latter  be  taken  of  the  shortcomings  of  Ado's work.  The  valuable  volume  of  the  erudite Dom  Quentin  (issued  in  1908)  should  be  consulted for  details. *ADOLPHUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  11)  
(13th cent.)  A Bishop of Osnabruck in Germany,  remarkable  for  his  saintliness  of  life and  especially  for  his  self-sacrificing  care  for the  poor.  He  died  A.D.  1222.

See  SS. EUSEBIUS,  MARCELLUS, &c. ADRIAN.

ADRIO,  VICTOR  and  BASILLA  (SS.)  

MM.  (May  17)  
(4th  cent.)  Egyptian  Martyrs  at  Alexandria. It  seems  certain  that  they  suffered  in  one  of the  persecutions  of  the  fourth  century,  but whether  at  the  hands  of  the  Pagans  at  its commencement,  or  later  under  the  Allans,  is not  clear,  all  particulars  being  lost.

(8th  cent.)  The  brother  of  St.  Botolph,  who with  that  Saint  journeyed  in  his  youth  from England  to  Saxony,  where  he  remained  for many  years  and  was  promoted  to  the  Episcopal dignity.  He  seems,  however,  to  have  returned to  England  before  his  death,  which  happened about  the  year  700,  and  his  relics  were  there mingled  with  those  of  his  holy  brother.

anus  and  a  pupil  of  St.  Pamphilius  of  Caesarea.  

After  having  in  various  ways  suffered  for  the 
Faith,  he  passed  into  Egypt,  where  we  read  of 
his  venturing to reproach  Heraclius,  the 
governor of the province, for the cruelties 
practised  by  him  against  the  Christians.  He 
was  put  to  the torture  for  his  boldness  and 
eventually  cast  into  the  sea  (a.d.  306).

yEMILIAN  (St.)  bbot.  (Nov.  12)  
(6th cent.) A poor shepherd in Angon 
(Spain),  who,  from  the  age  of  twenty  lived  for 
forty  years  as  a  hermit  in  the  mountains  near 
his  birthplace,  Vergaja,  until  his  Bishop 
constrained him to take priests' orders and 
made  him  parish  priest  of  his  native  village.  

But  his  zeal  created  him  enemies,  and  he  soon 
returned  to  his  hermitage,  where, celebrated 
for  his  miracles  and  virtues,  he  died  (A.D.  574).  

His  body,  interred  at  first  in  his  hermitage, 
was  later  transferred  to  a  magnificent  monastery 
built  in  memory  of  him.  It  is  alleged  that  he 
had  had  many  disciples  living  with  him  ; and 
on  that  account  he  has  always  been  venerated 
as an Abbot and as the introducer of  the 
Benedictine  Rule  into  Spain.  

JEMILIAN  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Feb.  8)  

See  SS.  DIONYSIUS,  .EMILIAN, &c.  

Some writers, however, identify tills St.  

jEmilian with another Martyr of the same 
name, likewise an Armenian, venerated at 
Trebbia  (Trevi)  in  Central  Italy,  as  first  Bishop 
of  that  citv  (4th  century).  

♦/EMILIAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  10)  
(8th  cent.) An  Irish  Saint,  related  to  St.

(4th cent.)  A Christian of Dorostorium (Sillistria)  on  the  Danube.  He  suffered  under Julian  the  Apostate,  being  burned  to  death  by order  of  the  Prefect  Capitolinus  (a.d.  362). /EMILIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  8)  
(9th  cent.)  The  Menology  of  Basil  ascribes to  this  holy  Bishop  of  Cyzicus  all  the  qualities and  virtues  of  a  perfect  pastor  of  souls,  emphasises his zeal for the Orthodox Faith and 
5 

^MILIAN 
enlarges  especially  on  his  fearless  denunciation of  the  Iconoclasts.  He  was  brought  before  the Emperor  Leo  the  Armenian,  subjected  to  many indignities,  and  died  in  exile  (a.d.  820).  

Cyzicus,  standing  on  the  island  of  the  same name  off  the  Southern  shore  of  the  Sea  of Marmora,  was  one  of  the  most  important  of the  Greek  cities  in  Asia  Minor,  a  great  Christian centre,  and  boasted  of  a  succession  of  fifty-nine Bishops. IEMILIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  11)  
(6th  cent.)  In  the  ancient  records  of  the Church  of  Vercelli  (Piedmont),  St.  iEmilian is  said  to  have  lived  as  a  hermit  for  forty  years before  his  elevation  to  the  Bishopric  of  that city.  He  thrice  visited  Rome  and  attended the  three  Synods  held  by  Pope  St.  Symmachus. He  died,  a  centenarian  in  the  year  520.  Translations of  his  relics  took  place  in  the  year  1181  and again  towards  the  end  of  the  seventeenth  century. */EMILIAN  (St.)  Conf.  (Oct  11)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  Roman  Martyrology assigns  this  St.  iEmilian  to  Rennes  in  Brittany  ; but  no  trace  of  a  Saint  of  this  name  can  be found  in  the  Breton  records.  The  Bollandists conclude  that  iEmilian  in  this  case  is  a  corruption of  the  name  Melanius.  A  Saint  Melanius, according  to  Albert  Legrand  and  other  local authorities,  was  Bishop  of  Rennes  for  sixty-two years  and  died  on  the  Feast  of  the  Epiphany, a.d.  567.  In  the  year  878  the  body  of  this Saint  was  rescued  from  the  outrages  of  the Norman  invasion,  and,  with  the  body  of  St. Clair,  carried  to  Bourges.  This  Translation (ninth  century)  may  have  been  commemorated on  Oct.  11  with  iEmilianus  in  error  substituted for  Melanius  in  the  official  documents. /EMILIAN  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  6)  
(5th  cent.)  An  African  physician,  a  Martyr of  the  Vandal  persecution  under  the  Arian King  Hunneric  (A. P.  484).  The  name  of St.  iEmilian  appears  in  a  curious  old  French litany  of  "  Saints  of  the  Medical  Profession." jEMILIANA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  5)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Roman  lady,  and  the  paternal aunt  of  St.  Gregory  the  Great,  who  tells  us, in  his  Life  of  St.  Felix,  that  her  dead  sister Tarsilla  appeared  to  St.  iEmiliana  and  foretold to  her  that  she  would  die  and  spend  the  Epiphany with  her  in  Paradise.  An  old  English Martyrology  thus  relates  the  above  incident. "  Her  sister's  ghost  appeared  to  her  in  a  nightly vision,  saying  to  her  :  '  Without  thee,  I  celebrated the  Holiday  of  the  Lord's  Birth,  but with  thee,  I  shall  keep  the  holiday  of  the Lord's  manifestation,  that  is,  the  Twelfth holiday  of  the  Lord,  the  day  of  His  Baptism.'  ' IEMILIANA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  30)  
(Date  unknown.)  She  is  stated  to  have  been a  Christian  maiden  who  lived  in  Rome  and died  a  Martyr.  But  all  particulars  are  lacking. A  priest,  Eutychius,  mentioned  as  having assisted  at  the  first  Roman  Synod  of  Pope St.  Symmachus  (a.d.  499),  is  described  as  being of  the  Church  of  St.  iEmiliana. jEMILIUS  (St.)  M.

(12th  cent.)  An  Englishman  who  followed St.  Anschar  as  a  missionary  to  Sweden,  where be  was  raised  to  the  Episcopal  dignity.  His zeal  for  the  propagation  of  the  Christian  religion 6 led  at  length  to  his  being  condemned  to  death by  King  Swerker  I,  surnamed  the  "  Bloody."

(7th  cent.)  A  holy  Bishop  of  Vienne  (France), commemorated  in  all  the  Martyrologies  as famous  for  his  virtues,  learning  and  miracles.  He flourished  in  the  first  half  of  the  seventh  century. Nothing  further  is  now  known  about  him.  

^ITHERIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  18)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  countless  Christians who  suffered  torture  and  death  under  the Emperor  Diocletian.  His  martyrdom  took place  probably  at  Nicomedia  (Asia  Minor), A.D.  304.  
 dETHERIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  27)  
(6th  cent.)  The  eighteenth  Bishop  of Auxerre  (France),  which  Diocese  he  governed till  his  holy  death  in  the  tenth  year  of  his Episcopate  (A.D.  573). 

♦JETIUS  (St.)  M.  (March  6)  
(9th  cent.)  A  General  in  the  Christian  army and  chief  among  the  heroic  band  of  forty-two soldiers  who,  taken  prisoners  by  the  Caliph Montassem  (a.d.  836)  at  Amorium  in  Syria, resisted  all  threats  and  allurements  to  become Mohammedans,  and,  after  nine  years  of  prison and  repeated  tortures,  were  put  to  death  by his  orders.  

♦AFAN  (St.)  Conf.  (Nov.  16)  
(6th  cent.) A  Welsh  Saint  of  the  Cunedda family, by some supposed to have been a Bishop.  He  has  given  its  title  to  the  Church  of Llanafan  (Brecknock).  

AFRIQUE  (AFRICUS)  Bp.  (April  28)  
(7th  cent.;  A  Bishop  of  Comminges  in  the South  of  France,  celebrated  for  his  zeal  for Orthodoxy.  His  memory  is  still  held  in  great veneration,  though  his  shrine  and  relics  were destroyed  by  the  Calvinists  in  the  sixteenth century.  

AFFROSA  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  4)  
Otherwise St. DAFROSA or DAPHROSA, which  see  

AFRA  (St.)  M.  (May  24)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  convert  to  Christianity,  made by  the  Martyrs  SS.  Faustinus  and  Jovita,  and baptised  by  the  Bishop  St.  Apollonius.  She was  the  wife  of  a  nobleman  of  the  city  of Brescia  in  Lombardy,  where  in  the  end  she suffered  martyrdom  about  a.d.  133.  It  was  in her  church  at  Brescia  that  St.  Angela  Merici founded  the  Ursuline  Order  and  was  herself buried.  

AFRA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  a  courtesan in  the  city  of  Augsburg  in  Bavaria,  but  converted by  a  saintly  Bishop,  whom  she  sheltered in  his  flight  from  his  persecutors.  When  the persecution  reached  Augsburg,  Afra  was  seized and  taken  before  the  judge,  who,  failing  to  move her  constancy,  condemned  her  to  be  burned alive  (A.D.  304).  The  same  fate  attended  her mother,  St  Hilaria,  and  her  maids,  Digna, Eunomia  and  Eutropia.  These  pious  women, whilst  occupied  in  the  interment  of  St.  Afra, were  imprisoned  in  the  burial  vault  by  soldiers, who  filled  it  with  burning  logs  and  branches, and  so  roasted  them  to  death.  An  Abbey Church  was  built  over  the  vault  and  dedicated to  St.  Afra. AFRICAN  MARTYRS.  The  early  Church  of  North  Africa  was  one  of the most flourishing and one of the most prolific  of  Saints  in  Christendom.  African Saints,  of  whom  St.  Augustine  and  St.  Cyprian are  the  best  known,  will  be  found  in  their  order. Similarly,  groups  of  Martyrs  taking  their  names from  the  chief  sufferers  in  each.  Of  those  who are  simply  registered  without  mention  of  name in  the  old  Martyrologies  certain  groups  claim special  notice.  

It  may  be  remarked  that  African  Martyrs can  chronologically  be  distributed  in  three series  :  1.  Sufferers  in  the  persecutions  under the  Roman  Emperors.  2.  Those  of  the  persecution by  the  Arian  Vandals.  3.  Victims  of the  Mohammedan  hatred  of  Christianity.  

The  North  African  Church  was  a  branch  of the Latin Church.  Egyptian Martyrs were under the Patriarchate of Alexandria, and therefore  are  treated  apart.  

AFRICA  (MARTYRS  IN).  (Jan  6)  
(3rd  cent.) A  number  of  Christian  men  and women,  burned  at  the  stake  in  Africa  about a.d.  210,  under  the  Emperor  Septimius  Severus.  

AFRICA  (MARTYRS  IN).  (Feb.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  known  as  the  "  Guardians of  the  Holy  Scriptures."  They  elected  rather to  die  than  to  deliver  up  the  Sacred  Books  to be  burned  as  ordered  in  the  great  persecution under  Diocletian.  Those  commemorated  on Feb.  11  suffered  in  the  Province  of  Numidia (A.D.  303).  St.  Augustine  makes  special mention  of  them.  

AFRICA  (MARTYRS  IN).  (April  5)  
(5th  cent.)  A  congregation  of  Catholic Christians  massacred  on  Easter  Sunday  (a.d. 459),  by  order  of  the  Arian  Genseric,  King  of the  Vandals,  while  assisting  at  Mass.  The lector,  who  was  in  the  act  of  intoning  the Alleluia  from  the  lectern  at  the  moment  when the  soldiers  rushed  into  the  church,  had  his throat  pierced  bv  an  arrow.  

AFRICA  (MARTYRS  IN).  (April  9)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  body  of  Christians  done to  death  at  Masyla,  probably  near  Fez  in Morocco,  in  one  of  the  early  persecutions. They  were  held  in  great  veneration  in  the African  Church.  A  panegyric  preached  by St.  Augustine  in  their  honour  is  extant.  They are  also  commemorated  in  one  of  the  Hymns of  the  Christian  poet,  Prudentius.  

AFRICA  (MARTYRS  IN).  (Oct.  16)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Two  hundred  and  twenty Christians  commemorated  from  ancient  times as  having  suffered  death  for  Christ  on  a  sixteenth day  of  October.  But  neither  the  year, nor  the  precise  place,  nor  any  details  of  their martyrdom,  have  come  down  to  us.  

AFRICA  (MARTYRS  IN).  (Oct.  30)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  group  of  between  one hundred  and  two  hundred  Christians,  massacred in  one  of  the  earlier  persecutions.  The  Martyrologies, however,  give  no  particulars  as  to  date, place,  or  nature  of  their  passion.  It  should always  be  remembered  that  one  of  the  objects of  the  great  persecution,  for  which  the  Emperor Diocletian  is  responsible  at  the  close  of  the third  century  of  the  Christian  Aera,  was  the destruction  of  the  Sacred  Books  and  records of  the  Cliristians.  In  this  the  Pagans  were only  too  successful,  and  the  loss  to  Ecclesiastical History  has  been  irreparable.  The  Annals of  the  early  Martyrs,  in  particular,  have  become very  incomplete.  In  regard  to  the  Churches of  Africa  and  of  the  East,  the  laying  waste by  the  Arabs  of  the  countries  involved  the destruction  of  libraries  and  Archives,  and  has had  a  similar  disastrous  result.  In  Western Europe,  thanks  to  the  scholarly  copyists  maintained in  the  monasteries,  much  has  survived, not  only  of  classical  literature,  but  also  of records  of  early  Christianity  dating  at  least from  the  fourth  century.  

AFRICA  (MARTYRS  IN)'.  (Dec.  16)  
(5th  cent.)  A  number  of  holy  women  (probably nuns),  who  laid  down  their  lives  (a.d.  482), in  witness  to  the  Catholic  Faith,  then  proscribed by  the  Arian  Vandal  King  of  Africa,  Hunneric. The  bodies  of  some  were  crushed  by  heavy weights,  and  of  others  were  scorched  by  red-hot metal  plates.  The  lives  of  the  rest  were  taken after  slow  tortures.

(3rd  cent.)  An  early  Bishop  of  Verona (North  Italy),  "  eminent  (according  to  Cardinal Baronius)  for  his  love  of  God,  for  his  gentle manners  and  for  his  liberality  towards  the poor."  The  date  of  his  death  is  uncertain.  

AGABUS  (St.)  Conf.  (Feb.  13)  
(1st  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  one  of  the seventy-two  disciples  sent  out  to  preach  by Our  Lord  (Luke  x.)  and  thus  an  eye-witness of  His  miracles.  He  is  mentioned  as  a  disciple and  prophet  in  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles  (xi.  28). The  Greek  Church  commemorates  the  martyrdom of  St.  Agabus  at  Antioch  on  March  8. From  a  tradition  among  the  Carmelites,  he  is usually  represented  in  art  robed  in  the  habit of  that  Order  and  holding  the  model  of  a church  in  his  hand.  

♦AGAMUND  (St.)  M.  (April  9)  
(9th  cent.)  One  of  the  Croyland  Abbey monks,  who  had  attained  his  hundredth  year when,  in  the  irruption  of  the  heathen  Danes (about  a.d.  870),  he,  with  his  Abbot  St.  Theodore and  many  of  his  brethren,  was  barbarously put  to  death.  As  in  the  case  of  many  others of  the  ancient  Saints,  the  circumstances  of  his death  were  thought  sufficient  to  justify  the giving  to  him  the  title  of  Martyr.

(4th  cent.)  Two  sisters  who,  with  a  third sister,  byname  Irene,  and  some  other  Christians, were  charged  with  concealing  the  Sacred  Books of  the  Christians  which  had  been  ordered  to  be given  up  to  be  destroyed,  and  who  were  on  that account  burned  at  the  stake  at  Thessalonica, under  the  Emperor  Diocletian  (a.d.  304).

AGAPITUS  (AGAPETUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  16)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Ravenna  (Italy), said  to  have  been  chosen  to  that  See,  as  had been  his  ten  predecessors,  in  consequence  of the  alighting  of  a  white  dove  on  his  shoulders at  the  moment  of  the  election.  Some  authors confuse  this  St.  Agapitus  with  another  Bishop of  Ravenna  of  the  same  name,  but  who  does not  seem  to  have  been  publicly  venerated  after his  death  (4th  cent.)  as  a  Saint.  

AGAPITUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  24)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Synnada  in  Phrygia (Asia  Minor),  who  flourished  in  the  first  half  of the  third  century,  and  who  seems  to  have undergone  much  suffering  in  one  of  the  persecutions of  the  period.

AGAPITUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  18)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Palestrina (Praeneste),  near  Rome.  He  was  a  youth  of noble  birth  who,  at  the  age  of  fifteen  was arrested  as  a  Christian,  and  after  being  put  to the  torture  was  sentenced  to  death.  The brave  boy  was  thrown  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the Amphitheatre ;  but,  as  not  rarely  happened in  the  case  of  Christian  Martyrs,  the  fierce creatures  refused  to  do  him  any  harm.  The sight  of  the  miracle  astounded  the  spectators, and  was  followed  by  the  conversion  to  Christianity of  not  a  few  among  them,  of  whom  one  was St.  Anastasius,  a  tribune  in  the  army.  The judge  cut  matters  short  by  ordering  Agapitus to  be  forthwith  beheaded.  This  passed  during the  so-called  ninth  persecution,  that  under  the Emperor  Aurelian (a.d.  274).  The  Cathedral of  Palestrina  now  stands  on  the  site  of  the martyrdom  of  St.  Agapitus.  In  the  year  974, his  relics  were  enshrined  in  a  natural  cave  or grotto  in  its  crypt ;  but  five  centuries  later translated  in  great  part  to  Corneto,  near  Civita Vecchia.  A  liturgical  commemoration  of  St. Agapitus  is  made  in  the  Universal  Church annually  on  Aug.  18,  the  anniversary  of  his passion.

AGAPIA  (AGAPES)  V.M.  (Feb.  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  instructed by  St.  Valentine,  Bishop  of  Terni,  by  whom  she was  chosen  to  preside  over  a  body  of  religious women.  She  suffered  martyrdom  about  A.d. 270.  

AGAPITUS  (St.)  Pope.  (Sept.  20)  
(6th  cent.)  By  birth  a  Roman,  he,  when only  Archdeacon  of  the  Roman  Church,  according to  a  custom  prevalent  in  that  age,  was elected  (a.d.  535)  to  succeed  Pope  John  II. In  the  following  year  he  repaired  to  Constantinople, partly  to  avert  the  war  on  Italy  threatened by  the  Emperor  Justinian,  and  partly to  put  order  into  the  troubled  Eastern  Churches. He  failed  in  his  political  mission,  but  succeeded in  rescuing  the  Church  of  Constantinople  from the  Eutychian  heretics.  "With  great  courage he  denounced  and  cancelled  the  election  as Patriarch  of  the  metropolis  of  the  East,  of Anthimus,  a  time  server  who  refused  to  subscribe the  Canons  of  the  Council  of  Chalcedon, then  the  test  of  Orthodoxy.  He  then,  as Supreme  Pontiff,  appointed  to  the  vacant  See, Mennas,  an  Ecclesiastic  of  undoubted  virtue and  of  great  learning.  Whilst  occupied  in dealing  with  complaints  of  heterodoxy  made against  various  Eastern  Bishops,  St.  Agapitus died  at  Constantinople  that  same  year.  His body  was  taken  to  Rome  and  interred  with those  of  his  predecessors  in  the  Basilica  of St.  Peter.  The  Greeks  commemorate  him  as  a Saint  on  April  17,  the  anniversary  of  his  death. Several  of  his  letters  are  still  extant.

(3rd  cent.)  The  Spanish  Saints,  Agapius and  Secundums  (said  to  have  been  Bishops), were  banished  to  Africa  in  the  persecution  under Valerian.  There,  at  Cirrha  (near  Constantine), they  were  put  to  death  ( 4..D.  259)  together  with Tertulla,  iEmilian  and  other  Christians,  among whom  was  a  mother  with  her  twin  children.

AGAPIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  of  Caesarea  in  Palestine. During  the  first  years  of  the  persecution under  Diocletian,  he  thrice  suffered  imprisonment for  the  Faith.  At  last,  again  arrested by  order  of  the  Emperor  Galerius  and  chained to  a  murderer,  he  was  brought  to  the  public amphitheatre  to  be  cast  to  the  wild  beasts. His  companion  obtained  the  Emperor's  pardon  ; and  to  Agapius  also  liberty  was  offered,  but  on condition  of  his  renouncing  Christ.  He  refused, and  a  bear  was  let  loose  upon  him  ;  but  after having  been  terribly  mauled  by  the  animal, he  was  found  to  be  still  alive.  Weighted  with heavy  stones,  his  body  was  then  cast  into  the  sea (a.d.  306).  St.  Agapius  is  also  commemorated with  SS.  Timothy,  Thecla  and  others  on  Aug.  19.  

AGATHA  (St.)  V.M.  (Feb.  5)  
(3rd  cent.)  Palermo  and  Catania  both  claim the  honour  of  being  the  birthplace  of  this famous  Sicilian  Saint,  whose  name,  enshrined in  the  Litany  of  the  Saints  and  in  the  Canon of  the  Mass,  appears  in  the  old  Martyrology of  Carthage  and  in  all  others,  Greek  and  Latin. In  the  numerous  frescoes  and  sculptures  which have  come  down  to  us  from  antiquity,  she  is represented  holding  a  pair  of  pincers  or  with other  instruments  of  the  tortures  to  which  she was  subjected.  The  traditional  details  of  her bitter  Passion  are  given  in  the  Lections  for  her Feast  in  the  Roman  Breviary.  After  suffering exquisite  tortures,  she  died  of  her  wounds  in prison  at  Catania,  during  the  persecution  under Decius  (A.D.  250).  The  miracles  by  which  her intercession  has  preserved  Catania  in  successive eruptions  of  Mount  Etna  are  well  authenticated. Her  Acts  in  Latin,  alleged  to  be  based  on  others from  the  pen  of  an  eye-witness  of  her  martyrdom, are  substantially  reliable.  

♦AGATHA  (St.)  Matron.  (Feb.  5)  
(11th  cent.)  The  wife  of  a  Count  of  Carinthia, devoted  to  her  domestic  duties  and  a  model  of patience  under  the  most  grievous  trials.  She was  ever  occupied  in  good  works  and  especially in  the  care  of  the  poor  and  distressed.  She died  a.d.  1024,  and  many  miracles  since  worked at  her  tomb  bear  witness  to  her  sanctity.  

AGATHANGELUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  A  deacon  of  Ancyra  in  Galatia, who  suffered  martyrdom  with  his  Bishop, St.  Clement,  about  the  year  309.  Their  relics were  brought  to  Paris  by  the  Crusaders  in  the thirteenth  century.  The  existence  and  cultus of  these  Martyrs  is  undoubted,  though  the learned  Baronius,  and,  after  him,  modern historians  in  general,  reject  the  legends  concerning them  current  in  the  Middle  Ages,  as  romances based  on  spurious  documents  which  had  been put  forth  as  genuine  Acts.  The  Greeks  have  a special  commemoration  of  St.  Agathangelus on  Nov.  5,  and  they  give  him  two  other  deacons, Pheugon  and  Chariton,  and  several  Christian children  as  his  companions  in  martyrdom.  

AGATHO  (St.>  Pope.  (Jan.  10)  
(7th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Palermo  in Sicily,  his  birthplace.  He  embraced  there  the monastic  life  in  the  Benedictine  monastery  of St.  Hermes,  but  was  elected  to  the  Papal throne  on  June  27  A.D.  678.  The  Sixth Ecumenical  Council  was  held  at  Constantinople during  his  Pontificate  (A.D.  680).  He  restored St.  Wilfrid  to  the  See  of  York  and  otherwise benefited  the  Church  in  England,  whither  he sent  skilled  masters  to  reintroduce  the  Roman Church-chant.  The  tradition  is  that  he  was already  a  centenarian  on  his  elevation  to  the Papacy.  He  was  endued  in  an  extraordinary degree  with  the  grace  of  working  miracles,  and hence  surnamed  Thaumaturgus  "  (the  wonder worker).  He  died  and  was  buried  in  St.  Peter's, A.D.  682.

AGATHO  and  TRIPHINA  (SS.)  MM.  (July  5)  
(4th  cent,  probably).  Of  the  Sicilian  Martyr St.  Agatho  little  is  known ;  but  his  name  has become  prominent  on  account  of  the  controversy among  the  learned  concerning  the  St.  Triphina bracketed  with  him  in  the  Registers.  Some authors  go  so  far  as  to  assert  that  this  fellowsufferer  with  St.  Agatho  was  not  a  woman,  but a  Christian  man,  by  name  Triphonius  or  Tryphon.  Others  hold  the  view  that  the  Saint Triphina  of  July  5  is  identical  with  the  St. Triphomena  to  whom  the  Cathedral  of  Minori near  Salerno  is  dedicated.  This  latter  Saint AGNES is  admitted  by  all  to  have  been  a  Sicilian  ;  and her  martyrdom  is  assigned  to  the  first  years  of the  fourth  century  under  Diocletian.  But antiquaries  cannot  yet  be  said  to  have  solved satisfactorily  the  problem  of  SS.  Agatho  and Triphina.  

AGATHO  (St.)  (Dec.  7)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  soldier,  posted  at  Alexandria as  guard  over  the  bodies  of  certain  Christian Martyrs,  which  he  prevented  a  mob  of  Pagans from  outraging.  For  this  humane  act,  he  was set  upon  and  dragged  before  the  magistrates as  a  suspected  Christian.  Whether  he  had  been previously  such  or  not  is  uncertain  ;  but  in  the Court  of  Justice  he  fearlessly  confessed  Christ, and  on  his  own  confession  was  sentenced  to death  and  beheaded.  He  was  one  of  the victims  of  the  persecution  under  the  Emperor Decius  (a.D.  250).  

AGATHOCLIA  (St.)  V.  M.  (Sept.  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Christian  servant  maid  of a  Pagan  lady  in  Spain,  and  by  her  cruelly  treated on  account  of  her  religion.  In  the  end  she  was denounced  to  the  authorities  during  one  of  the persecuting  decades  of  the  third  century — one of  the  most  troubled  in  the  annals  of  the  Church. The  poor  slave  girl  was  savagely  scourged ; and  to  prevent  her  repeating  again  and  again, as  was  her  wont,  the  comforting  name  of  Jesus, her  tongue  was  torn  out.  She  was  at  last beheaded  ;  but  neither  the  precise  time  nor  the place  are  now  known.

AGATHONICUS, ZOTICUS and OTHERS (SS.) MM.  (Aug.  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  According  to  the  Menology  of Basil,  St.  Agathonicus  was  a  Christian  of patrician  family  put  to  death  for  the  Faith  in the  neighbourhood  of  Constantinople,  during the  persecution  under  Diocletian  and  Maximian Herculeus,  towards  the  close  of  the  third century.  With  him  suffered  Zoticus,  by profession  a  philosopher,  and  several  of  the pupils,  or,  as  they  were  called,  disciples  of  the latter.  The  Emperor  Justinian,  more  than  a hundred  years  later,  built  a  magnificent  church in  their  honour.  They  are  mentioned  in  the Latin  Martyrologies,  and  in  the  Imperial Library  at  Vienna  there  is  preserved  a  valuable MS.  record  of  their  Passion.  

AGATHOPEDES and THEODULUS (SS.)  MM.  (April  4)  
(4th  cent.)  A  deacon  with  his  lector,  arrested at  Thessalonica  as  Christians,  and  drowned  in the  sea  by  order  of  the  President  Faustinus, during  the  persecution  of  the  savage  Maximian Herculeus,  colleague  of  Diocletian.  This  happened in  one  of  the  first  years  of  the  fourth century.

AGATHIUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  18)  
(Date  unknown.)  One  of  a  band  of  thirty-six missionaries,  who,  in  the  first  or  second  century, sought  to  propagate  Christianity  in  Egypt, which  country  they  for  that  purpose  divided into  four  regions.  To  St.  Agathius  with  eight others  fell  the  eastern  districts.  The  conversions they  made  were  numerous  and  continual. Eventually  arrested,  they  were  condemned  to death  and  were  burned  at  the  stake  as  "  impious men,  disturbers  of  public  order."  

AGERICUS  (AGUY,  AIRY)  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  1)  
(6th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Desideratus (D6sire)  in  the  See  of  Verdun  (France).  His charity  and  kindliness  endeared  him  to  princes and  people  alike  ;  and  his  prayers  and  counsel were  sought  by  all.  He  worked  many  miracles, both  in  his  life  and  after  his  holy  death,  which came  to  pass  in  the  year  591. 

AGGAEUS  (AGGEUS,  HAGGAI)  Prophet.  (July  4)  
(6th  cent.  B.C.)  The  tenth  among  the  Minor Prophets  of  the  Old  Testament.  Very  little  is recorded  or  preserved  by  tradition  concerning him.  His  prophecy  is  brief  and  contains  his commission  to  deliver  the  Divine  message  to King  Darius  Hystaspes  of  Persia,  to  forward the  rebuilding  of  the  Temple  of  Jerusalem. He  seems  himself  to  have  seen  the  former Temple,  in  which  supposition  he  must  have  been a  very  aged  man  when  he  delivered  his  prophecy ;  but  a  contrary  belief  among  the  Jews has  it  that  he  was  born  during  the  exile,  and that  he  lived  to  see  the  second  temple  (B.C. 516).

AGILAEUS  (AGLEUS)  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  An  African  who  suffered  at Carthage  in  the  last  great  persecution,  about A.D.  300.  His  relics  were  afterwards  translated to  Rome  ;  and  hence  he  became  well  know  in the  Western  Church.  One  of  the  Homilies  of St.  Augustine  was  preached  on  his  Festival.  

♦AGILULPH  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (July  9)  
(8th  cent.)  A  monk,  and  later,  Abbot  of Stavelot,  who  became  Bishop  of  Cologne,  and, incurring  in  the  zealous  discharge  of  his  ministry the  enmity  of  the  famous  potentate  Charles Martel,  was  put  to  death  by  his  connivance (A.D.  770).  

♦AGILUS  (AISLE,  AIL)  Abbot.  (Aug.  30)  
(7th  cent.)  A  young  nobleman  of  the Frankish  Court  who  became  a  disciple  of  the Irish  Saint  Columbanus  at  Luxeuil  in  Eastern France.  There  he  lived  a  holy  life  under St.  Eustasius  for  many  years.  Later  he  went as  a  missionary  into  Bavaria,  and  finally  became Abbot  of  Rebais,  near  Paris,  where  he  died A.D.  650,  at  the  age  of  sixty-six.

AGNELLUS  (St.)  Conf.  (Dec.  14)  
(7th  cent.)  Agnellus,  otherwise  Anellus, born  at  Naples  of  wealthy  parents,  at  the  age  of fifteen,  became  a  hermit.  Later  in  his  life some  African  monks,  who  had  been  driven  into exile  by  the  Arians  and  had  settled  at  Naples, prevailed  upon  him  to  become  their  Abbot. He  died  A.D.  596.  As  to  the  Rule  followed  in his  monastery,  some  think  it  to  have  been  that of  St.  Basil,  others  that  of  St.  Benedict.  He  is represented  clothed  with  the  religious  habit and  bearing  a  cross  or  standard,  as  in  such  guise he  has  often  appeared  at  Naples  and  repidsed the  enemies  who  were  assailing  the  town.  His relics  were  enshrined  in  an  ancient  church of  Our  Blessed  Lady  which  later  was  named after  him.  Moroni  relates  that  during  his lifetime,  when  the  Saracens  (a.d.  674)  besieged the  city  of  Naples,  St.  Agnellus  raised  the  standard of  the  Cross,  and,  at  the  head  of  the Neapolitan  troops,  put  the  besiegers  to  flight.  

AGNES  (AGNA)  V.M.  (Jan.  21)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Virgin-Martyr,  everywhere venerated  and  one  of  those  daily  commemorated in  the  Canon  of  the  Mass.  At  the  tender  age of  thirteen,  she  obtained  the  double  crown  of martyrdom  and  chastity.  Failing  to  burn  her at  the  stake,  the  Prefect  of  Rome  under  Maximian Herculeus  ordered  her  to  be  beheaded (a.d.  301),  though  this  precise  date  is  much contested.  She  was  buried  on  the  Via  Nomentana,  where  a  church  was  built  by  Constantia, daughter  of  the  Emperor  Constantine.  St. Agnes  is  represented  in  various  ways,  but  mostly with  a  lamb  at  her  feet  and  a  sword  in  her  hand. Many  details  of  the  fifth  century  Acts  of  St. Agnes  are  open  to  criticism,  though  substantially the  circumstances  of  her  martyrdom are  autlientic.  

AGNES  OF  BOHEMIA  (St.)  V.  (March  6)  
(13th  cent.)  A  princess,  daughter  of  the King  of  Bohemia  and  sister  of  the  King  of Hungary,  who  to  a  marriage  with  the  Emperor Frederick  II.  preferred  the  life  of  a  Poor  Clare. By  her  gentle  piety  she  gained  the  hearts  of all  with  whom  she  had  to  deal.  Pope  Gregory IX.,  who  greatly  valued  her,  placed  her  at  the head  of  all  the  convents  of  her  Order.  She passed  away,  a.d.  1282,  at  the  age  of  seventyseven  years.  

AGNES  OF  MONTE  PULCIANO  (St.)  V.  (April  20)  
(14th  cent.)  Born  at  Monte  Pulciano  in Tuscany,  at  an  early  age  Agnes  emhraced  the religious  life  in  the  Dominican  convent  of Proceno,  of  which  she  became  the  Prioress, passing  later  to  that  founded  by  herself  at  her birthplace,  where,  famous  for  sanctity  of  life and  for  the  supernatural  graces  bestowed  upon her,  she  died  in  her  forty-ninth  year  (A.D.  1317). She  was  canonised  four  hundred  years  later.  

AGNES  OF  POITIERS  (St.)  V.  (May  13)  
(6th  cent.)  Chosen  by  St.  Radegund  to  be Abbess  of  the  two  hundred  nuns  of  her  monastery of  Holy  Cross  at  Poitiers,  the  two  Saints journeyed  together  to  Aries  where  from  the hands  of  St.  Caesarius  they  received  the  Rule of  their  community.  St.  Agnes  died  shortly after  her  holy  mistress  (a.d.  588).  

♦AGNES  (St.)  V.M.  (Aug.  28)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Reputed  of  British  birth, and  venerated  at  Cologne  as  a  Martyr. She was  possibly  one  of  the  sufferers  with  St.  Ursula.  

♦AGNES  OF  ASSISI  (Bl.)  V.  (Nov.  16)  
(13th  cent.)  The  sister  of  St.  Clare  and  one of  the  first  to  embrace  the  religious  life  under the  Rule  of  St.  Francis,  as  a  Poor  Clare  or Minoress.  St.  Francis  placed  her  as  Abbess over  the  convent  of  these  nuns  which  he  had founded  at  Florence.  She  returned  to  Assisi  in 1253  to  assist  at  the  death-bed  of  her  holy sister,  and  three  months  later  rejoined  her  in Heaven.  On  earth  they  shared  the  same tomb. AGOARDUS,  AGLIBERTUS and OTHERS (SS.)  

MM.  (June  24)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  group  of  Martyrs  described as  having  been  so  numerous  as  to  defy  counting. They  appear  to  have  been  massacred  in  a  popular outbreak  against  the  Christians,  at  Creteil, near  Paris.  The  tradition  is  that  SS.  Agoardus and  Aglibert,  their  leaders,  had  come  from  the Rhine  country,  and  that  SS.  Ewaldus,  Altinus and  Savinian  had  converted  them  to  Christianity. The  details  concerning  these  Martyrs, now  available,  are  very  untrustworthy  ;  and the  dates  given  still  more  so.  But  a.d.  273 seems  likely  as  the  year  of  their  triumph.  

♦AGOFRIDUS  (AGOFROI)  (St.)  Abbot. (Aug.  24)  
(8th  cent.)  The  brother  and  successor  of St.  Leofridus  as  Abbot  of  Lacroix,  a  Benedictine monastery  of  the  Diocese  of  Evreux  in Normandy.  He  became  Abbot  A.D.  738. The  date  of  his  death  is  not  given.  

AGRICOLA  (AREGLE,  AGRELE)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  17)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  Bishop  of  Chalon-surSaone,  zealous  for  the  spiritual  good  of  his  flock and  for  the  orderly  performance  of  Divine service.  He  took  part  in  several  French  Church Councils.  St.  Gregory  of  Tours  enlarges  upon the  austerity  of  his  private  life.  He  died  A.D. 580,  at  the  age  of  eighty-three.  

AGRICOLA  (AGRICOLUS)  (St.)  (Sept.  2)  
(7th  cent.)  The  son  of  St.  Magnus,  a  Frankish noble,  who  late  in  life  took  Holy  Orders  and eventually  was  promoted  to  the  See  of  Avignon. St.  Agricolus,  his  son,  entered  the  monastery of  Lerins  as  a  Religious,  and  there  acquired  a great  reputation  for  piety  and  learning.  Summoned by  his  father  to  Avignon,  he  speedily made  himself  beloved  and  esteemed  by  clergy and  laity  alike,  and  was  in  due  course  called to  occupy  that  Metropolitan  See.  He  governed his  Diocese  for  forty  years  to  the  great  profit 10 of  his  people,  and  died  A.D.  700,  in  the  sixty-fourth  year  of  his  age.

AGRICOLA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  3)  
(Date unknown.)  A Martyr in Hungary who  se  "  gesta  "  have  not  come  down  to  us, but  whose name appears in all  the ancient Registers.  

AGRICOLA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  16) See  SS.  VALENTINE,  CONCORDIUS, &c.  

AGRIPPINA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  23)  
(3rd  cent.)  According  to  the  Greeks,  she  was a  Roman  maiden  of  tender  years  who  courageously and  joyfully  endured  cruel  torture  and death  for  the  Faith  in  the  reign  of  the  Emperor Valerian  (a.d.  256).  Her  relics  were  removed from  Rome  to  Sicily  by  SS.  Bassa  and  Paula.  

AGRIPPINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  9)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  holy  man  who,  in  the  second century  of  the  Christian  Aera  made  the  See  of Naples  illustrious  by  his  zeal  for  the  Catholic Faith  and  by  his  working  of  miracles.  His relics,  originally  interred  in  the  old  Cathedral Church  called  "  Stephania,"  were  subsequently enshrined  under  the  High  Altar  of  the  actual Cathedral  of  Naples,  with  the  bodies  of  SS. Eutychetes  and  Acutius,  fellow-sufferers  with St.  Januarius.  

AGRITIUS  (AGRICE,  AGUY)  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  13) (4th  cent.)  A  Syrian,  chosen  at  the  instance of  the  Empress  Helena  from  the  ranks  of  the clergy  of  Antioch  to  become  Bishop  of  Treves in  Germany.  He  was  consecrated  to  that  See by  Pope  St.  Sylvester.  The  Empress  Helena further  committed  to  his  care  the  Seamless Tunic  of  Our  Blessed  Lord,  thenceforth  known as  the  Holy  Coat  of  Treves  and  the  object  of  a famous  pilgrimage.  The  Imperial  Palace  at Treves  was  converted  into  a  Cathedral,  and  the Emperor  Constantine  was  lavish  of  favours  to the  missionary  Bishop  sent  thither  from  the East.  St.  Agritius  laboured  zealously  and successfully  during  twenty  years  at  the  conversion of  Gaul  and  of  Western  Germany.  After his  death  (a.d.  335)  his  remains  were  interred in  the  Basilica  of  St.  John,  now  called  St. Maximin's,  after  his  famous  successor  in  the Bishopric.  

AGUY  (St.)  
An  abbreviated  popular  form  of  the  names AG  ERIC  US  and  AGRITIUS.  

♦AIBERT  (St.)  Conf.  (April  7)  
(12th  cent.)  A  Benedictine  monk  in  the north  of  France,  who  passed  to  the  life  of  a hermit.  His  long  life  of  eighty  years  was, almost  from  infancy,  one  of  continuous  prayer and  penance.  It  is  related  of  him  that  he never  missed  saying  two  Masses  daily,  one  for the  Dead  and  one  for  the  Living.  He  died A.D 1140.  

♦AIDAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  20)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Irish  Bishop  in  Mayo.  He died  A.D.  768.  

AICHARDUS  (AICARD,  ACHARD) (St.) Abbot.  (Sept.  1)  
(7th  cent.)  The  son  of  an  officer  at  the  Court of  Clotaire  II,  born  at  Poitiers  and  destined  by his  father  for  a  military  career.  But  his  own wish,  which  was  also  that  of  his  mother,  that he  should  consecrate  himself  to  God,  was eventually  fulfilled,  and  he  took  the  monastic habit  in  the  Abbey  of  St.  Jouin  in  Poitou. He  became  in  succession  Abbot  of  the  monasteries of  Quinzay  and  Jumieges.  Throughout his  life,  a  model  of  prayer,  austerity,  and  of observance  of  Religious  Rule,  he,  at  his  own request,  expired  (a.d.  687)  on  a  couch  of  sackcloth and  ashes.  

♦AID  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  11)  
(Date  uncertain.)  An  Abbot  of  AchadFinglas  in  County  Carlow,  possibly  one  and  the same  with  St.  Aed  or  Maedhogh  of  Clonmore.  

AIDAN  (AEDAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  31)  
(7th  cent.) In  response  to  a  request  from ALBERT  

St.  Oswald,  King  of  Northumbria,  St.  Aidan, a  monk  of  the  famous  Abbey  of  Hy  or  Iona, was  chosen  by  the  Abbot  Seghen  for  the  special mission  of  rekindling  the  Faith  in  the  Kingdom of  Northumbria.  He  was  forthwith  consecrated Bishop  and,  on  his  arrival  in  the  North  of England,  took  for  his  See  the  Island  of  Lindisfarne  (Holy  Island),  where  he  founded  a  famous Abbey.  His  Diocese  reached  from  the  Forth to  the  Humber.  The  account  of  the  miracles he  worked  and  other  particulars  of  his  saintly life  are  to  be  found  in  the  writings  of  Venerable Bede.  He  founded  many  churches  and  schools for  which  he  provided  masters  from  among  his fellow  monks.  He  died  at  Bamborough  in  the eighteenth  year  of  a  fruitful  Episcopate  (a.d. G51).  A  graceful  tradition  is  to  the  effect  that the  young  shepherd  boy  Cuthbert,  at  the moment  of  the  passing  away  of  St.  Aidan,  saw in  a  vision  the  soul  of  the  Saint  carried  up  by angels  into  Heaven,  and  thereupon  himself  set about  preparing  by  a  life  in  the  cloister  for carrying  on  the  work  for  God  to  which  the Saint  had  been  devoted.  Nor  did  the  fame  of St.  Cuthbert  fall  short  of  that  of  St.  Aidan. St.  Aidan  is  represented  in  art,  sometimes  with a  torch  in  his  hand,  sometimes  with  a  stag  near him,  suggested  by  a  legend  that  once  he  by  his prayer  rendered  invisible  a  deer  pursued  by huntsmen.  

AIGNAN  (AGNAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  1)  
Otherwise  St.  ANIANUS,  which  see. AIGULPHUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM. (Sept.  3) (7th  cent.) Monks  of  Fleury,  an  Abbey  on the Loire.  St. Aigulphus was sent by his Abbot,  St.  Mommolus,  to  rescue  the  relics  of St.  Benedict  from  the  ruins  of  Monte  Cassino, where they were enshrined.  He afterwards undertook  a  much  needed  reform  of  discipline in  the  Abbey  of  Lerins  off  the  coast  of  Provence, but  was  resisted  by  a  local  chieftain  or  baron, who,  in  the  end,  caused  him  to  be  murdered  with several  of  his  fellow  monks  (a.d.  676).  

♦AILBHE  (ALBEUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  12)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  concerning  whose life  and  Apostolic  labours  there  are  few  reliable particulars  extant.  He  must  have  been  contemporary with  St.  Patrick  in  the  fifth  century, and  have  worked  chiefly  in  the  South  of  Ireland, where  he  is  venerated  as  Patron  Saint  of  Munster and  as  first  Bishop  of  the  See  of  Emly,  later united  to  Cashel.  

AIME  (AME)  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  12) Otherwise  St.  AMATUS,  which  see.  

AIRY  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  1)  
Otherwise  St.  AGERICUS,  which  see.

Otherwise  St.  AGILUS,  which  see.  

AITHELAS  (St.)  M.  (April  22)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  band  of  Persian  Martyrs of  which  the  leader  was  St.  Abdiesus.  

♦AIZAN  and  SAZAN  (SS.)  MM.  Conf.  (Oct.  1)  
(4th  cent.) Two  brothers,  kings  or  chieftains in  Abyssinia,  distinguished  for  their  attachment to  the Catholic Faith and  for  their  zeal in propagating  Christianity  in  Africa.  They  were honoured with the friendship of the great St.  Athanasius.  One  or  other  of  them  appears to  have  survived  till  nearly  the  year  400,  and their  cultus  was at  once, after  their  deaths, established  among  the  Ethiopians.  

AJOU  (AJON)  Abbot,  M.  (Sept.  3) Otherwise  St.  AIGULPHUS,  which  see.  

AJUTRE  (St )  Conf.  (April  30)  
Otherwise  St.  ADJUTOR,  which  see.  

"ALANUS  and  ALORUS  (SS.)  Bps.  (Oct.  26)  
(5th cent.) Two Bishops of Quimper in Brittany,  who  flourished  in  the  fifth  century, but  concerning  whom no  reliable particulars have  come  down  to  us,  except  the  fact  of  the popular  and  Liturgical  veneration  given  to  them from  early  ages.  

ALBAN  (St.)  M.  (June  21)  
(4th  cent.)  A Greek  priest  of  Naxos  who, sent  into  exile  by  the  Arians,  preached  the  Gospel in  parts  of  Germany  about  Mainz.  Here  he  was again  attacked  by  the  Arians,  and  eventually put  to  death  by  them,  towards  a.d.  400.  A celebrated  Abbey  at  Mainz,  dedicated  in  his honour,  has  preserved  his  memory.  

ALBAN  (St.)  M.  (June  22)  
(4th  cent.)  The  first  Martyr  of  Britain. He  suffered  in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian (probably  a.d.  303),  though  the  Edicts  of  persecution were  only  rarely  enforced  in  the  provinces governed  by  Constantius  Chlorus.  St.  Alban was  converted  to  the  Faith  by  a  priest  to  whom he  had  given  shelter  and  whose  life  he  had  thus saved.  Several  wonderful  occurrences  signalised his  martyrdom,  as  related  by  Bede  and others.  It  took  place  at  Verulam,  a  town which  received  the  name  of  St.  Albans  after the  erection  there  of  the  famous  Abbey  of  that name,  the  work  of  King  Offa  of  Mercia  in  the eighth  century.  With  St.  Alban  suffered  one of  the  executioners,  who,  at  sight  of  the  Saint's courage  and  constancy,  had  declared  himself also  to  be  ready  to  embrace  Christianity.  The priest  who  was  saved  by  St.  Alban,  who  disguised him  in  his  own  cloak  (styled  a  Caracalla), and  who  is  commonly  known  as  St.  Amphibalus, is  said  to  have  fled  into  Wales,  there  to  have effected  many  conversions,  and  ultimately  to have  sealed  his  Faith  with  his  blood.  In  art, St.  Alban  is  usually  represented  with  a  cross in  one  hand  and  a  sword  in  the  other,  with  a river  or  spring  in  the  foreground.  

♦ALBERIC  (Bl.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  26)  
(12th  cent.)  Abbot  of  Citeaux  and  one  of the  founders  of  the  Cistercian  Order  of  Monks under  the  Rule  of  St.  Benedict,  the  characteristic feature  of  which  order  was  insistence  on the  observance  to  the  letter  of  that  ancient Western  Rule.  St.  Alban  placed  his  reform under  the  special  patronage  of  Our  Blessed Lady,  and  in  her  honour  gave  his  monks  the white  robe  they  still  wear.  He  died  a.d.  1109.  

♦ALBERT  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan  8)  
(7th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Cashel  in Ireland.  Unfortunately  a  reliable  account  of the  life  of  St  Albert  does  not  exist.  We  know of  him  that  with  St.  Erard,  he  took  part  in  the evangelising  of  Bavaria,  and  that  he  died  and was  interred  at  Ratisbon.  He  flourished  at the  close  of  the  seventh  century.  

ALBERT  (St.)  Conf.  (Aug.  7)  
(14th  cent.)  A  Sicilian  Friar  of  the  Order of  Mount  Carmel,  to  which  his  mother,  hitherto childless,  had  vowed  him  before  his  birth. When  of  sufficient  age  he  willingly  ratified  his mother's  vow  and  entered  among  the  Carmelites of  Mount  Trapani.  He  lived  a  life  of  extreme austerity  and,  by  his  zeal  in  preaching,  called many  sinners  back  to  the  paths  of  virtue.  He also  converted  numerous  Jews  to  the  true  Faith. He  died  in  a  solitude,  that  is,  in  a  lonely  hermitage of  his  Order,  in  the  year  1306,  and  was buried  in  the  Carmelite  Church  at  Messina,  of which  city  he  is  recognised  as  one  of  the  Patron Saints.  He  was  canonised  about  the  middle of  the  fifteenth  century.  

♦ALBERT  (Bl.)  Bp.  M.  (Sept.  14)  
(13th  cent.)  An  Italian  Bishop  of  the  Order of  Canons  Regular  who,  after  governing  the Sees  of  Bobbio  and  Vercelli  and  labouring strenuously  to  reconcile  the  German  Emperor with  the  Holy  See,  became,  under  Innocent  III, Patriarch  of  Jerusalem.  The  Holy  City  having unhappily  again  fallen  under  the  sway  of  the Infidels,  Bl.  Albert  established  his  See  at  Acre, and  for  eight  years  until  his  death  (a.d.  1214), distinguished  himself  for  piety  and  pastoral zeal.  At  the  request  of  St.  Brocard,  he  composed a  wise  and  accepted  Rule  for  the  Carmelite Order.  He  was  assassinated  by  an  evil-liver whom  he  had,  as  was  his  duty,  sternly  rebuked, and  has  since  been  venerated  as  a  Martyr.  

♦ALBERT  THE  GREAT  (Bl.)  Bp.  (Nov.  15)  
(13th  cent.)  The famous Dominican philosopher and theologian who had St. Thomas

THE  BOOK  OP  SAINTS 

Aquinas  for  his  pupil  and  whose  own  works place  him  in  the  first  ranks  of  Mediaeval  Schoolmen. A  German  by  birth,  after  refusing  many Ecclesiastical  dignities,  content  to  serve  in  his own  Order,  he  was  constrained  by  the  Pope  to accept  the  Bishopric  of  Ratisbon  ;  but,  after three  years  of  able  and  successful  pastoral work,  was  allowed  to  retire  to  his  convent  at Cologne,  where  he  died  a.d.  1280,  being  then in  his  eighty-eighth  year.  His  works  are published  in  twenty-six  folio  volumes.  

ALBERT  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Nov.  21)  
(12th  cent.)  The  son  of  Godfrey  III  and brother  of  Henry,  Duke  of  Lorraine  and  Brabant. Choosing  the  clerical  profession,  he  was appointed  to  the  Cathedral  Chapter  of  Li6ge, of  which  Diocese  he  became  Archdeacon.  His virtues  were  such  as  to  recommend  him  as  the successor  of  his  Bishop,  Radulphus,  though  his promotion  was  opposed  both  by  Baldwin, Count  of  Hainault,  and  by  Henry  VI,  Emperor of  Germany.  St.  Albert  appealed  to  Rome, whither  he  travelled  in  disguise  Pope  Celestine not  only  declared  his  election  to  the  See  of  Liege perfectly  legitimate,  but  further  raised  him  to the  dignity  of  Cardinal.  Consecrated  at  Rheims by  the  Archbishop  and  awaiting  there  an  opportunity of  returning  to  his  Bishopric,  he  was lured  outside  the  city  walls  by  some  creatures of  the  Emperor,  who  pretended  to  be,  like  himself, victims  of  persecution,  and  murdered  by them  (a.d.  1192).  Of  his  relics  part  are  at Liege  and  part  at  Louvain.

♦ALBERTA  (St.)  V.M.  (March  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  One  of  the  earlier  victims  of  the persecution  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  286).  She suffered  at  Agen  in  the  South  of  France.  

♦ALBEUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  3)  

Otherwise  St.  AILBHE,  which  see.  

ALBINA  (St.)  V.M.  (Dec.  16)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  young  Christian  znaiden  who suffered  at  Caesarea  in  Palestine,  in  the  persecution under  Decius  (A.D.  250).  But  the  Roman Martyrology  seems  to  imply  that  she  was  carried to  Italy  and  there  put  to  death.  Her  relics have  certainly  from  time  immemorial  been enshrined  in  the  Cathedral  of  Gaeta  in  the Neapolitan  territory.  The  Greeks  allow  this, but  explain  it  by  urging  a  miraculous  translation of  her  body  after  martyrdom.  

ALBINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  5)  

See  SS.  GENUINUS  and  ALBINUS.  

ALBINUS  (AUBIN)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  2)  
(6th  cent.)  A  native  of  the  Diocese  of  Vannes in  Brittany,  who,  after  spending  a  quarter  of  a century  in  the  cloister,  was  elected  Bishop  of Angers  (a.d.  529).  He  took  a  prominent  part in  the  Third  Council  of  Orleans  (A.D.  538). A  church  and  Abbey  were  erected  to  his  memory at  Angers.  St.  Aubin  de  Moeslain  (Haute Marne)  is  a  popular  place  of  pilgrimage.  

ALBINUS  (AUBIN,  ALPIN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  15) (4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Justus  in the  See  of  Lyons  between  A.D  380  and  A.D.  390, but  the  length  of  his  Episcopate  is  uncertain. He  is  said  to  have  built  the  Church  of  St. Stephen  and  to  have  chosen  it  for  his  Cathedral. He  was  buried  at  Lyons,  but  it  is  uncertain  in what  church.  

♦ALBINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  26)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  Saint,  by  name Witta,  who  took  the  name  Albinus,  a  Latinised form,  when  setting  out  as  a  fellow-worker  with St.  Boniface  in  the  conversion  of  Germany. One  of  the  new  Missionary  Bishoprics  in  that country  was  allotted  to  him.  

♦ALBURGA  (St.)  Widow.  (Dec.  25)  
(9th  cent.)  Sister  to  King  Egbert  of  Wessex, and  married  to  a  noble  of  his  Court,  after  whose death  she  retired  to  the  monastery  which  she had  founded  at  Wilton,  near  Salisbury,  where she  passed  away  sometime  in  the  ninth  century. 12 

♦ALCHMUND  (St.)  M.  (March  19)  
(8th  cent.)  A  prince  of  the  Royal  House  of Northumbria,  who  after  many  years  of  exile among  the  Picts  in  Scotland  met  his  death  in Shropshire  (A.D  800)  in  circumstances  which led  to  his  end  being  regarded  as  a  martyrdom. Many  miracles  were  wrought  at  his  tomb,  and his  relics  were  enshrined  in  a  magnificent  church erected  in  his  honour  at  Derby.  

♦ALCUIN  (ALBINUS)  (Bl.)  Abbot.  (May  19)  
(9th  cent.)  A  native  of  York  who  has  the reputation  of  having  been  the  most  learned man  of  his  time.  Well  versed  in  Greek  and Latin  literature,  he  gave  great  impetus  to  the founding  of  schools,  both  in  England,  and  later in  France.  A  favourite  of  the  Emperor  Charlemagne (whose  almoner  he  became),  Alcuin  used all  his  influence  with  that  monarch  to  advance the  kindred  causes  of  Christianity  and  civilisation. He  reformed  the  discipline  of  various monasteries  and  died  Abbot  of  St.  Martin's  at Tours  (A.D.  804).  We  have  from  his  pen Commentaries  on  Holy  Scripture  to  the  correcting of  the  Latin  text  of  which  Alcuin  gave much  time  and  labour  ;  likewise,  volumes  of letters  and  other  works.  

♦ALDATE  (ELDATE)  (St.)  (Feb.  4)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Briton  who  lived  in  the  western counties  of  England,  and  who  in  some  legends is  styled  Bishop  of  Gloucester.  Aldate's  patriotism in  stirring  up  his  fellow-countrymen  to resist  the  heathen  invaders  of  the  land,  coupled with  his  pious  and  exemplary  life,  gained  for him  local  repute  as  a  Saint.  Many  churches bear  his  name  as  their  Titular  Saint ;  but  reliable details  of  his  life  are  lacking.  His  death may  safely  be  assigned  to  the  middle  of  the fifth  century.  There  is  some  reason  to  believe that  there  were  two  Saints  of  this  name  in  the England  of  the  fifth  and  sixth  centuries  ;  but  it is  impossible  to  disentangle  their  legends.  

ALDEGUNDA  (ORGONNE)  (St.)  V.  (Jan  30)  
(7th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Maubeuge on  the  Sambre,  in  the  North  of  France,  and  the foundress  of  its  famous  Abbey.  She  was  of the  Royal  House  of  the  Merovingians  and trained  to  holiness  by  St.  Amandus,  Bishop  of Maestricht,  from  whom  she  received  the  veil  of religion.  She  died  of  cancer  about  a.d.  680, and  was  succeeded  as  Abbess  by  her  niece, St.  Adeltrude.  

♦ALCHMUND  and  GILBERT  (TILBERT)  (SS.) Bps.  (Sept.  7)  
(8th  cent.)  Two  Bishops  of  Hexham  in Northumbria,  the  one  and  the  other  locally venerated  as  a  Saint.  St.  Alchmund  died  after thirteen  years  of  Episcopate  (a.d.  780),  and  his successor  St.  Gilbert,  nine  years  later.  

♦ALDERICUS  (ALDRICUS,  ELRIC)  (St.) Bp.  (Jan.  7)  
(9th  cent.)  Bishop  of  Le  Mans  in  the  West of  France,  a  learned  and  most  pious  prelate, devoted  to  the  poor  and  to  the  religious  interests of  his  Diocese.  He  was  also  in  high  repute  for ability  in  the  management  of  affairs  ;  and,  by his  holiness  of  life,  impressed  all  at  the  Court  of King  Louis  le  Debonnaire.  The  works  he  wrote are  unfortunately  lost.  He  died  A.D.  856.  

♦ALDETRUDE  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  25)  
(7th  cent.)  A  niece  of  SS.  Aldegundis  and Waldetrude,  who  embraced  the  religious  life in  the  monastery  founded  by  the  former  at Maubeuge  in  France.  In  due  course  she  succeeded her  aunt  as  Abbess.  She  seems  to  have lived  to  extreme  old  age,  as  her  death  is  placed in  the  last  quarter  of  the  seventh  century.  

ALDHELM  (ADHELM)  (St.)  Bp.  (May  25)  
(8th  cent.)  The  son  of  Kenter,  a  relative  of Ina,  King  of  Wessex,  and  a  pupil  at  Canterbury of  the  Abbot  St.  Adrian.  He  further  pursued his  studies  under  St.  Maidulf,  an  Irish  scholar and  the  Founder  of  Malmesbury  (Maidulfsbury). St.  Aldhelm  himself  became  Abbot  later  on  in his  life  of  this  same  Abbey  of  Malmesbury,  and, while  holding  this  charge,  at  the  request  of  a 
ALEXANDER 

Synod,  wrote  his  well-known  letter  to  Gerontius, King  of  the  Daranonian  Britons  on  the  vexed question  of  the  date  of  Easter.  On  the  division of  the  Diocese  of  Wessex,  St.  Aldhelra  was appointed  Bishop  of  the  Western  half,  with  his See  at  Sherborne  in  Dorsetshire.  Four  years later  (A.d.  709)  he  died  at  Dulting  in  Somersetshire. He  was  undoubtedly  a  highly  accomplished prelate,  and  was  the  first  among  the Anglo-Saxons  invaders  of  Britain  to  cultivate both  Latin  and  vernacular  poetry.  

♦ALENA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  24)  
(7th  cent.)  A  young  girl  of  noble  birth  in  the country  now  called  Belgium,  who,  having  been converted  to  Christianity,  while  secretly  journeying to  hear  Mass,  was  set  upon  and  barbarously put  to  death  by  the  pagans  of  the neighbourhood,  about  a.d.  640.  

ALEXANDER  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Jan.  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  native  of  Fermo,  near  Ancona in  Italy,  who  became  Bishop  of  his  native  city wherein  he  laboured,  "  faithful  unto  death." He  perished  in  the  persecution  under  the Emperor  Decius  (a.d.  250).  His  relics  are  still enshrined  in  his  Cathedral.  

ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  30)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  venerable  old  man  who,  for repeatedly  proclaiming  his  Christian  belief,  was tortured  and  put  to  death  in  the  persecution under  Decius  (a.d.  251),  at  Edessa  in  Syria. Some  historians  think  that  this  St.  Alexander is  identical  with  the  Saint  of  the  same  name, Patriarch  of  Jerusalem,  whose  Feast  is  celebrated on  March  18.  Nor  does  this  seem improbable.  

ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  9)  
(Date  uncertain.)  On  Feb.  9,  the  Roman Martyrology  commemorates  two  Saints  of  the name  Alexander.  The  one  is  represented  as having  suffered  martyrdom  in  Rome  with  thirtyeight  other  Christians.  The  other  is  described as  a  Martyr  in  Cyprus,  with  a  St.  Ammonius as  a  fellow-sufferer.  There  is  possibly  some error  here,  due  to  the  ancient  copyists.  The learned  Bollandists  distribute  these  Martyrs quite  differently,  add  twenty  to  their  number, and  insist  that  they  all  perished  in  Africa  or  in the  East,  though  of  some  the  relics  may  have been  translated  to  Rome.  

ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  18)  

See  SS.  MAXIMUS,  CLAUDIUS, &c.  

ALEXANDER  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  26)  
(4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Achillas  in the  Patriarchal  See  of  Alexandria,  and  a champion  of  the  Faith  against  the  heretic  Arius. To  his  influence  over  the  Emperor  Constantino are  due  in  great  part  the  facilities  which  that monarch  afforded  to  the  Bishops  for  their gathering  at  the  memorable  Council  of  Nicaea (A.D.  325).  St.  Achillas  died  in  the  following  year.  

ALEXANDER.  ABUNDIUS,  ANTIGONUS  and FORTUNATUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  27)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Martyrs  who  have  remained in  popular  memory  but  of  whom  we  have no  record.  Some  believe  them  to  have  suffered in  Rome  ;  others  in  Thessaly.  Their  names, too,  are  variously  spelled  which  adds  new  difficulties to  the  research.  

ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (March  10)  

See  SS.  CAIUS  and  ALEXANDER.  

ALEXANDER  and  THEODORE  (SS.)  

MM.  (March  17)  
(Date  uncertain.)  These  Saints,  Cardinal Baronius  describes  as  Roman  Martyrs,  whose names  he  found  in  the  ancient  MSS.  he  collated, together  with  a  series  of  other  names  purporting to  have  been  companions  in  martyrdom  with Alexander  and  Theodore.  St.  Alexander  is sometimes  described  as  a  Bishop,  and  St.  Theodore as  his  deacon.  Their  names,  too,  are sometimes  found  written  Nicander  and  Theodulus.  There  is  no  trace  discoverable  nowadays anywhere  of  their  history.  In  the  middle  of the  ninth  century,  Pope  Sergius  II  solemnly translated  and  enshrined  their  relics. 

ALEXANDER  OF  JERUSALEM  (St.)  

Bp.  (March  18)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  fellow-student  with  Origen at  Alexandria  in  Egypt.  He  became  Bishop  of a  See  in  Asia  Minor,  where  he  suffered  for  the Faith  in  the  time  of  Septimus  Severus  (a.d. 204).  When  on  a  visit  to  Jerusalem,  he  was chosen  by  the  Patriarch,  St.  Narcissus,  as  his coadjutor.  He  lived  to  a  very  great  age  and was  at  length  (a.d.  250)  arrested  in  the  persecution under  Decius.  He  died  in  prison  at Caesarea  in  Palestine  a  few  months  afterwards.  

ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (March  24)  

Two  Martyrs  of  this  name  are  included  in  the group  SS.  TIMOLAUS,  DIONYSIUS,  &c, which  see.  

ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (March  27)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  soldier,  described  in  the  Roman Martyrology  as  having  suffered  as  a  Christian in  Hungary,  under  the  Emperor  Maximian Herculeus,  colleague  of  Diocletian.  There  is great  difficulty  in  distinguishing  this  St.  Alexander from  St.  Alexander  of  Thrace  (May  13).  

ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (March  28)  

See  SS.  PRISCUS.  MALCHUS, &c.  

ALEXANDER  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  24) (2nd  cent.)  A  Greek  by  birth,  and  the friend  and  companion  of  St.  Epipodius  of Lyons.  He  was  arrested  as  a  Christian,  put  to the  torture  and,  in  the  end,  crucified  (A.d.  177). Thirty-four  other  Christians  of  Lyons  perished at  the  same  time.  

ALEXANDER,  EVENTIUS  and  THEODULUS (SS.)  MM.  (May  3)  
(2nd  cent.)  Pope  St.  Alexander  I,  a  Roman by  birth,  succeeded  St.  Evaristus,  a.d.  108, or  as  others  contend,  a.d.  121,  and  reigned for  about  ten  years.  A  constant  tradition attributes  to  him  the  change  in  the  Canon  of the  Mass  of  the  words  used  by  St.  Paul :  "  Who in  the  night  in  which  He  was  betrayed,"  into those  now  employed  :  "  Who  the  day  before He  suffered."  St.  Alexander  was  put  to death,  together  with  his  two  priests,  Eventius and  Theodulus,  under  the  Emperor  Hadrian. Modern  research  and  especially  the  discovery of  the  tomb  of  this  early  Pope  has  tended  to confirm  the  account  of  St.  Alexander  handed down  to  us  in  Mediaeval  Acts,  hitherto  regarded as  unreliable.  

ALEXANDER  and  ANTONINA  (SS.)  MM.  (May  3) (4th  cent.)  St.  Alexander,  a  Christian soldier,  during  the  persecution  under  Diocletian and  his  colleagues,  succeeded  in  rescuing  a Christian  maiden,  St.  Antonina,  from  a  house of  ill-fame,  to  which,  as  was  not  unusual  in  pagan times,  she  had  been  condemned.  They  were both  arrested  and,  after  preliminary  torture, burned  to  death  at  Constantinople  (a.d.  313), Maximin  Daza  then  reigning  in  the  East.

He,  however, paid  for  his  intrepidity  with  his  life ;  for  on his  return,  after  having  won  his  cause,  he  was waylaid  by  his  opponents  and  drowned  in  the river  Arno  (A.D.  590).

(3rd  cent.)  This  Saint  Alexander  has acquired  the  surname  Carbonarius  (the  charcoalburner),  an  occupation  which  he  voluntarily took  up  in  preference  to  the  career  which  his wealth  and  noble  birth  had  opened  out  before him.  On  the  death  of  their  Bishop,  the  clergy and  laity  of  Comana,  a  suffragan  See  of  NeoCaesarea  in  Asia  Minor,  applied  to  St.  Gregory Thaumaturgus  for  the  choice  of  a  successor. His  rejecting  certain  candidates  proposed because  of  their  worldly  position  led  to  one  of the  clergy  jestingly  proposing  Alexander  the Charcoal-burner,  who  on  being  examined,  was found  in  reality  to  have  all  the  qualities  requisite in  a  Bishop.  St.  Alexander  was  burned  to  death at  the  stake,  as  a  Christian,  a.d.  250. ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  26)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Tribune  in  the  Theban  Legion (See  SS.  Mauritius,  etc.)  who,  being  arrested and  condemned  to  death,  made  his  escape from  the  prison  at  Milan,  but  was  retaken  outside the  walls  of  Bergamo  and  there  beheaded, it  is  said,  in  the  presence  of  Maximin  Herculeus himself  (a.d.  297).  The  Acts  of  the  Martyr are  preserved  at  Bergamo,  where  his  relics  are enshrined  in  the  Cathedral. ALEXANDER  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  to  preside  over the  See  of  Constantinople,  after  its  change  of name  from  Byzantium.  During  the  stormy period  of  the  struggle  of  the  Church  against  the Arian  heresy,  he,  ably  supported  by  his  namesake of  Alexandria,  was  a  resolute  champion of  the  Catholic  Faith.  He  assisted  at  the Council  of  H  ice  ;  and,  though  threatened  with banishment,  persisted  in  his  refusal  to  allow Arius  to  communicate  with  the  Church  of  Constantinople. The  awful  death  of  Arius  is regarded  as  a  response  to  the  Saint's  prayer for  deliverance  from  his  machinations.  St. Alexander  is  commemorated  by  the  Greeks  on August  30.  He  died  at  a  ripe  old  age  a.d.  340. ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  9)  

See  SS.  HYACINTH,  ALEXANDER, &c. ALEXANDER  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Sept.  21)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  holy  Bishop,  whose  See  was in  the  neighbourhood  of  Rome.  Having  by his  prayers  recalled  dead  men  to  life,  his  fame spread  about,  and  he  was  arrested  and  put  to  the torture.  In  the  end  he  was  beheaded  on  the Claudian  Way,  some  twenty  miles  from  Rome, in  what  precise  year  is  unknown.  Pope  St. Damasus  in  the  fourth  century  translated  his relics  and  enshrined  them  in  one  of  the  Roman churches. ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  28)  

See  SS.  MARK,  ALPHIUS, &c. ALEXANDER  SAULI  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  11)  
(16th  cent.)  One  of  God's  instruments  in the  restoration  of  Church  discipline  in  Italy in  the  sixteenth  century.  Of  noble  birth  in Lombardy,  he  joined  the  recently  founded Order  of  Barnabites,  of  which  he  became General.  His  chief  sphere  of  work  was  in Corsica,  where  for  twenty  years  he  was  Bishop of  Aleria.  Made  in  1591,  against  his  will, Bishop  of  Pavia,  he  died  there  (April  23)  in the  following  year.  He  was  beatified  in  1741, and  canonised  by  Pope  Pius  X  A.D.  1904.

MM.  (Oct.  22)  
(Date  unknown.)  St.  Alexander,  a  Bishop, but  whose  See  is  not  mentioned,  is  described  in the  Menology  of  Basil  as  having  preached  the Gospel  with  such  success  as  toAhave  converted 
14 

to  the  Faith  of  Christ  a  multitude  of  both  Jews and  Pagans.  Arrested  and  brought  before  the Imperial  authorities,  no  torture  could  induce him  to  consent  to  take  part  in  heathen  rites. One  of  his  guards  was  so  moved  by  the  sight  of the  constancy  of  the  Martyr  that  he  too  proclaimed himself  a  Christian,  and  was  in  consequence beheaded.  This  is  the  St.  Heraclius honoured  with  St.  Alexander.  Other  converts followed.  St.  Alexander  and  his  disciples  were in  the  end  all  put  to  death.  Unfortunately, neither  the  date  nor  the  place  of  their  martyrdom have  come  down  to  us. ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  9)  
(4th cent.) A Confessor, who suffered at Salonica,  under  the  Emperor  Maximian  Herculeus, Diocletian's  savage  colleague  (A.d.  304). No  particulars  are  discoverable. ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  24)  
(4th cent.)  One of the sufferers in the persecution under Julian the Apostate.  He died  for  the  Faith  at  Corinth  a.d.  361. ALEXANDER  BRIANT  (Bl.)  M.  (Dec.  1)  
(16th  cent.)  A  holy  priest,  with  a  "  sweet grace  in  preaching,"  who  shortly  before  his martyrdom  joined  the  Society  of  Jesus.  While in  prison  for  the  Faith  he  was  severely  racked and  otherwise  put  to  many  tortures.  He suffered  at  Tyburn,  with  Blessed  Edmund Campion  and  Blessed  Ralph  Sherwin,  Dec.  1, A.D.  1581. ALEXANDER  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  12)

See  SS.  THEODOTUS,  THECUSA, &c. ALEXANDRIA  (MARTYRS  OF).  

Of  the  innumerable  Christians  who  laid down  their  lives  for  Christ  in  Egypt,  in  the early  persecutions  under  the  heathen  Roman Emperors,  in  the  troubles  with  the  Eutychian heretics,  and  in  the  massacres  consequent  on the  over-running  of  the  country  by  the  Mohammedan Arabs,  a  large  proportion  suffered  at Alexandria,  the  metropolis.  Many  of  these Ma*"*  are  mentioned  in  this  volume  in connection  with  the  Bishops  or  others  who were  their  leaders,  this  being  the  method followed  by  the  Martyrologies  and  other ancient  catalogues  of  Saints.  A  few  other important  groups  of  Alexandrian  Martyrs are  the  following.  They  were  mostly  victims of  mob  violence,  in  massacres  of  Christians tolerated  by  the  authorities,  rather  than  Christians tried  in  regular  form  and  condemned to  death  by  magistrates. ALEXANDRIA  (MARTYRS  OF)  (Jan.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Arian  officer,  by  name Syrianus,  at  the  head  of  a  troop  of  soldiers, entered  the  great  church  of  Alexandria,  insulted the  Patriarch  St.  Athanasius,  who  was  offering the  Holy  Sacrifice,  and  without  formalities  of any  kind  ordered  those  present  to  be  put  to death.  St.  Athanasius  was  among  the  few who  escaped  (a.d.  356). ALEXANDRIA  (MARTYRS  OF).  (Feb.  28)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Church  recognises  as Martyrs  to  charity  a  number  of  clerics  and  of laymen  who  sacrificed  their  lives  (a.d.  261) in  ministering  to  the  plague-stricken  in  a terrible  pestilence  at  that  time  raging  in Alexandria. ALEXANDRIA  (MARTYRS  OF).  (March  17)  
(4th  cent.)  A  multitude  of  Christians massacred  by  the  Pagan  devotees  of  Serapis on  their  refusal  to  join  in  the  idolatrous  worship offered  in  his  temple. This  was  the  work  of  a 
ALOYSIUS 

riotous  mob  (A.D.  390)  during  the  reign  of  the Christian  Emperor  Theodosius,  who  thereupon destroyed  the  temple  and  had  a  Christian church  built  upon  its  site.  

ALEXANDRIA  (MARTYRS  OF).  (March  21)  
(4th  cent.)  Catholics  of  both  sexes  (number unrecorded)  massacred  in  various  churches  of Alexandria  (a.d.  342)  by  the  Arians  who  had deposed  and  expelled  the  Patriarch,  St.  Athanasius,  their  great  opponent.  

ALEXANDRIA  (MARTYRS  OF)  (May  13)  
(4th  cent.)  A  great  number  of  Catholics put  to  death  or  exiled  from  Alexandria  (A.D. 372)  when,  for  the  fifth  time,  St.  Athanasius had  been  driven  from  his  flock,  under  the Arian  Emperor  Valens.  

ALEXANDRIA  (MARTYRS  OF)  (Aug.  10)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  multitude  of  Christians,  victims at  Alexandria  of  the  persecutions  under  the Emperors  Decius  and  Valerian.  St.  Denis  of Alexandria  gives  a  graphic  account  of  their sufferings.  They  are  in  the  Roman  Martyrology commemorated  together,  though  they  were put  to  death  in  various  years  between  A.D.  260 and  A.D.  267.  

♦ALEXIS  (ALEXIUS)  of  KIEFF  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  12) (14th  cent.)  A  Russian  nobleman  who embraced  the  religious  life  under  the  Rule  of St.  Basil,  and  who  later  became  Archbishop  of Kiew.  Famous  for  the  working  of  miracles and  for  wisdom  and  learning,  he  is  said  to have  been  appealed  to  for  advice,  even  by  the Sultan  of  the  Turks  in  Asia  Minor.  He  died A.D.  1364.  

ALEXIUS  FALCONIERI  (St.)  Conf.  (Feb.  17)  

One  of  the  HOLY  SEVEN  FOUNDERS  OF THE  SERVITE  ORDER,  which  see.  

ALEXIS  (ALEXIUS)  (St.)  Conf.  (July  17)  
(5th  cent.)  The  only  son  of  a  Roman Senator,  whom  desire  to  avoid  the  fascinations of  the  world,  impelled  to  fly  from  his  home  and promised  bride  on  his  wedding  day,  and  to  set sail  for  Asia  Minor.  On  his  arrival  there  he made  his  way  to  Edessa,  where  for  many  years he  lived  in  the  greatest  poverty  and  busied himself  in  prayer  and  good  works.  Dreading the  veneration  in  which  he  began  to  be  held on  account  of  his  holy  life,  he  journeyed  to  the coast  and  embarked  in  a  vessel  bound  for Tarsus.  But,  after  many  mishaps  at  sea,  he was  at  length  cast  ashore  on  the  coast  of  Italy, his  native  country,  and  so  returned  to  Rome. Acting  on  a  Divine  impulse,  he  there  sought shelter  in  his  father's  house,  in  a  shed  adjoining which  he  was  suffered  to  live  and  die,  disguised as  a  poor  mendicant,  without  his  identity  being discovered.  After  his  decease,  a  written paper  was  found  in  his  possession,  giving particulars  of  his  life  and  of  the  motives  which had  induced  him  to  act  as  he  had  done.  Pope Innocent  I  and  the  Emperor  Honorius  are said  to  have  been  present  at  his  obsequies and  at  his  burial  in  the  Church  of  St.  Boniface, erected  close  to  his  father's  mansion  (a.d.  404). The  many  miracles  wrought  at  his  intercession led  to  his  being  honoured  as  a  Saint.  

♦ALFERIUS  (ADALFERIUS)  (Bl.)  

Abbot.  (April  12)  
(11th  cent.)  The  founder  of  the  celebrated monastery  of  La  Cava  in  the  South  of  Italy. Among  his  disciples  was  the  future  Pope, Blessed  Victor  III.  Blessed  Alferius  died  at a  great  age  A.D.  1050.  

♦ALFRED  (ALTFRIED)  (Bl.)  Bp.  (Sept.  15)  
(9th cent.) A Bishop of Hildesheim in 
Germany, who died about A.D. 869, and is 
honoured  as  a  Saint. But  of  his  holy  life  no 
reliable  particulars  are  extant.

(11th  cent.)  A  Winchester  monk,  specially devout  to  SS.  Swithun  and  Cuthbert,  and remarkable  for  the  austerity  of  his  holy  and singularly  active  life.  He  was  made  Bishop of  Sherborne,  which  See  he  governed  with  zeal and  prudence  till  his  death  (a.d.  1058).

(5th  cent.)  A  fellow  citizen  and  disciple  of St.  Augustine  of  Hippo,  to  whom  he  was greatly  attached,  and  whom  he  followed  from Carthage  to  Rome  and  Milan,  where  they  were both  baptised  by  St.  Ambrose  on  Easter  Eve, A.D.  387.  Upon  their  return  to  Africa,  they spent  some  time  in  solitude  as  Religious. Afterwards  St.  Alipius  visited  the  Holy  Land. Elected  Bishop  of  Tagaste,  he  laboured  strenuously in  the  defence  of  the  Church  against  the Donatist  and  Pelagian  heresies.  He  is  said to  have  been  present  at  the  deathbed  of  St. Augustine  (a.d.  430),  and  to  have  himself passed  away  shortly  afterwards.
♦ALKELD  (St.)  V.  (March  27)  
(10th  cent.)  Two  Yorkshire  churches  are dedicated  to  this  Saint  (sometimes  called Athilda).  Nothing  whatever  is  known  of  her except  that  an  ancient  painting  represents  her being  strangled  by  Danish  pirates.  Such  an event  may  with  some  probability  be  assigned to  the  tenth  century.  But  her  name  does  not occur  in  any  of  the  older  Calendars  or  in  any Liturgical  record.

He  was  seized  and  cut  to  pieces by order of the Prefect Alipius (a.d. 404). The  Emperor  Honorius,  however,  availed  himself of  this  happening  to  put  an  end  to  the practice of sacrificing human beings in the public  sports. *ALMEDHA  (ELED,  ELEVETHA)  V.M.  (Aug.  1) (6th cent.) A daughter or granddaughter of  the famous King Brychan of Brecknock.

ALPHAEUS 
March  9,  1568.  Such  was  his  piety  that Cardinal  Bellarmine  helieved  Aloysius  to  have passed  his  whole  life  without  ever  grievously offending  Almighty  God.  After  serving  as  a page  at  the  Court  of  Spain,  he  in  his  eighteenth year  entered  the  Society  of  Jesus,  took  the  vows of  religion  and  received  minor  Orders.  He died  of  the  plague,  having  contracted  the infection  while  visiting  and  ministering  to  the sick  (a.d.  1591)  at  the  age  of  twenty-three. St.  Aloysius  is  usually  represented  in  art, clad  in  a  surplice,  and  with  a  lily  and  crucifix in  his  hands  or  near  him.  He  is  Patron  Saint of  the  young.  Many  churches  are  dedicated to  him  in  all  parts  of  the  world. ALPHAEUS  (St.)  Conf.  (May  26)  
(1st  cent.)  Commemorated  hy  the  Greeks as  the  father  of  the  Apostle  St.  James  the  Less, and  mentioned  as  such  in  the  Gospels  (Matt.  x. 3).  There  are  no  trustworthy  traditions  concerning him. ALPHAEUS  and  ZACCHAEUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  17)  
(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  in  Palestine  during  the persecution  under  Diocletian  (about  A.D.  302). They  were  prominent  among  the  multitude  of Christians  in  the  Holy  Land,  who  with  St. Procopius  laid  down  their  lives  for  Christ. In  the  accounts  we  have  of  them,  stress  is particularly  put  upon  their  heroic  endurance of  the  most  appalling  tortures,  previous  to their  execution. ALPHAGE  (ALPHEGE)  Bp.  M.

MM.  (May  10)  
(3rd  cent.)  Sicilian  Saints,  said  to  have  been brothers.  Their  Acts  are  unreliable  owing  to many  interpolations  ;  but  they  appear  to  have suffered  under  Decius  (a.d.  251).  They  are  in great  veneration  in  Sicily  and  also  among  the Greeks ALPHIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  28)

of  the  Church.  (Aug.  2)  
(18th  cent.)  Born  at  Naples  of  an  ancient and  noble  family,  he  began  his  public  life  as  a barrister,  but  soon  renounced  his  prospects  of a  brilliant  career  to  devote  himself  exclusively to  the  service  of  God.  He  joined  a  Society of  priests  formed  for  the  purpose  of  giving missions  and  instruction  to  the  people  of  the Kingdom  of  Naples,  and  became  a  true  Apostle of  Christ  who  crowned  his  preaching  and labours  with  wonderful  success  and  with  the gift  of  working  miracles.  At  Benevento  he founded  the  Congregation  of  the  Most  Holy Redeemer  to  perpetuate  this  special  work  of mission-giving.  After  refusing  many  Bishoprics, he  was  prevailed  upon  to  accept  that  of S.  Agata  dei  Goti,  by  Pope  Clement  XIII. As  a  bishop  he  showed  himself  a  model  of  every pastoral  virtue,  but  owing  to  failing  health, finally  obtained  permission  to  resign  his  See. The  remainder  of  his  life  he  employed  in  the composition  of  theological  and  ascetical  works, which  display  both  deep  learning  and  a  wonderful spirit  of  fervent  piety.  He  was  also  a poet  and  a  musician.  He  died  in  his  ninetieth year  (A..D.  1787)  in  the  odour  of  sanctity  and was  canonised  by  Pope  Gregory  XVI  in  the year  1839.  In  1871,  Pius  IX  proclaimed  him a  Doctor  of  the  Church.  Artists  usually represent  him  in  the  attitude  of  prayer  with  a monstrance  in  his  hand,  or  writing  with  pen and  paper  before  a  crucifix. ALPHONSUS  RODRIGUEZ  (St.)  Conf.  (Oct.  30)  
(17th  cent.) A  well-to-do  Spanish  merchant, who,  on  losing  his  wife  and  two  children,  joined 
16 

the  Society  of  Jesus  as  a  lay-brother,  and  for thirty  years  served  as  porter  in  a  Jesuit  College in  the  Island  of  Majorca.  He  was  enriched  by God  with  many  wonderful  supernatural  gifts, but  was  chiefly  remarkable  for  his  exceeding patience  and  humility.  He  died  A.d.  1617 at  the  age  of  eighty -six,  and  many  miracles  have been  wrought  in  favour  of  those  who  have invoked  him. ALPINIAN  (St.)  Conf.  (June  30)

On  his  return  he was  appointed  Bishop  of  Passau,  and  distinguished himself  by  his  resolute  support  of  Pope St.  Gregory  VII  in  that  Pontiff's  efforts  to reform  clerical  discipline  in  Germany.  He suffered  in  consequence  exile  and  persecution, nor  was  freed  from  the  latter  save  by  his  holy death  (A.d.  1091).  His  shrine  is  in  the  Abbey of  Gottweic,  which  he  had  founded. ALTO  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  5)  
(8th  cent.)  By  birth  a  Scot,  he  crossed  over into  Germany  and,  favoured  by  King  Pepin, founded  the  celebrated  Bavarian  Abbey  of Alt-Munster,  where  he  died  about  A.D.  760, having  been  the  means  of  the  conversion  to Christianity  of  a  multitude  of  Pagans.
♦ALVAREZ  of  CORDOVA  (Bl.)  (Feb.  9)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  the  Order  of  St. Dominic,  who  spent  his  life  in  preaching  and converting  sinners  throughout  Spain,  and  who laboured  hard  to  extinguish  the  great  Schism of  the  West,  occasioned  by  the  conflicting claims  of  two  rival  Popes.

AMANDUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  6)  
(7th  cent.)  Born  near  Nantes  in  the  West of  France,  he  embraced  the  monastic  life  in the  Abbey  of  St.  Martin  at  Tours  and,  at  the request  of  King  Clothaire  II,  undertook  missionary work  in  Flanders,  Brabant  and  Holland. For  this  purpose  he  was  consecrated  a  Missionary Bishop,  and  in  the  year  649  was  called  to govern  the  See  of  Maestricht.  He  founded  a great  number  of  churches  and  monasteries, besides  effecting  innumerable  conversions  to Christianity. In  his  declining  years  he  retired

to  the  Abbey  of  Elnon,  where  he  passed  away in  his  ninetieth  year  (a.d. 684).  He  is the Patron  Saint  of  Flanders  and  is  represented in  art  carrying  a  church  in  his  hand. AMANDUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  18)  
(5th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Delphinus as  Bishop  of  Bordeaux,  about  A.d.  404,  which See  he  resigned  for  a  time,  but  returned  to  it at  the  death  of  St.  Severinus,  who  had  succeeded him.  He  was  contemporary  with  St. Paulinus  of  Nola,  who  attributes  to  St.  Amandus his  own  conversion  to  Christianity  and  Baptism. They  died  about  the  same  time  (a.d.  431).

(5th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Provinus in  the  See  of  Como.  St.  Leo  the  Great  presented him  with  precious  relics  of  SS.  Peter  and  Paul, to  whom  he  dedicated  his  Cathedral  at  Como, wherein  he  himself  was  buried  (a.d.  440).  He is  still  held  in  great  veneration  by  his  flock, who,  in  the  sixteenth  century,  enshrined  his relics  in  a  church  dedicated  in  his  honour. AMANTIUS,  ALEXANDER  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (June  6)  
(Date  unknown.)  Said  to  have  been  four brothers  born  at  Cannes  on  the  Mediterranean coast,  and  together  converted  to  Christianity. Amantius  became  Bishop  of  Noyon  (France), whither  his  brothers  followed  him.  They  appear to  have  perished  together,  probably  in  one  of the  local  persecutions  of  the  second  century. AMANTIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  10)  

See  SS.  GETULIUS,  CEREALIS, &c. AMANTIUS  (St.)  Conf.  (Sept.  26)  
(6th  cent.)  A  priest  personally  known  to St.  Gregory  the  Great,  who  compared  him  to the  Apostles  in  regard  to  his  power  of  working miracles.  The  date  of  his  death  is  unknown,  but he  seems  to  have  been  called  to  his  reward  about a.d.  600  at  Tiphernum  (Citta  di  Castello),  near Perugia,  where  he  is  honoured  as  a  Patron  Saint. AMANTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  4)  
(5th  cent.)  A  native  and  Bishop  of  Rhodez (South  of  France),  and  second  Apostle  of  the district  which  had  fallen  away  from  Christianity. By  his  preaching  and  the  miracles  he wrought  he  won  his  people  back  to  Christ. He  died  about  a.d.  440. AMARANTHUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  7)  
(3rd  cent.)  Said  to  have  suffered  martyrdom at  Vieux,  near  Albi,  in  the  south  of  France in  the  third  century.  Little  or  nothing  is  known about  him,  save  what  we  can  glean  from  St. Gregory  of  Tours,  who  says  that  he  had  read the  account  of  his  martyrdom.  He  appears, however,  to  have  been  widely  venerated  in ancient  times.  St.  Eugene  of  Carthage, banished  from  Africa,  came  to  die  at  the  tomb of  St.  Amaranthus.  The  relics  of  both  Saints are  enshrined  in  the  Cathedral  of  Albi. AMATOR,  PETER  and  LOUIS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  30) (9th  cent.)  A  Spanish  priest  with  his  deacon and  layman,  put  to  death  by  the  Moors  at Cordova,  where  he  had  zealously  laboured, encouraging  his  fellow-Christians  to  remain faithful  to  Christ,  no  matter  how  much  persecuted because  of  Him. AMATOR  (AMATRE,  AMADOUR)  (St.)  

Bp.  (May  1)  
(5th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Valerian,  Bishop of  Auxerre,  and  the  husband  of  a  holy  woman venerated  locally  as  St.  Martha.  By  mutual agreement,  St.  Martha  entered  a  convent  and St.  Amator  received  Holy  Orders,  and  later succeeded  Eladius  as  Bishop  of  Auxerre  (A.D. 306).  In  his  turn  he  was  succeeded  by  the famous  St.  Germanus,  whom  he  had  ordained. St.  Amator  was  buried  (a.d.  418)  in  the  church which  he  had  built  in  honour  of  the  Martyr St.  Symphorian,  and  which  later  bore  his  own name. 

AMATOR  (AMADOUR)  (St.)  Conf.  (Aug.  20)  
(1st  cent.)  Supposed  to  have  been  the  first Christian  to  live  the  hermit's  life  in  Gaul. His  cell  was  at  Quercy,  near  Cahors,  and  is still  a  much  frequented  place  of  pilgrimage. His  body,  in  the  year  1126,  was  found  to  be incorrupt  and  flexible  as  when  first  laid  in  the tomb. AMATOR  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  26)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  citizen  of  Autun  (France), and  afterwards  Bishop  of  that  city.  He organised  the  Church  of  the  Aedui  (the  Gallic tribes  between  the  Saone  and  the  Loire),  and appears  to  have  been  Bishop  among  them  in a.d.  270.  His  body  was  interred  at  Autun, near  the  shrine  of  the  Martyr  St.  Symphorian, who  had  suffered  there  in  the  preceding  century. AMATUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  31)  
(12th  cent.)  The  life  of  this  Saint  has  been written  by  several  authors,  but  they  disagree considerably  even  as  to  the  century  in  which he  lived.  The  most  likely  account  of  him  is that  he  was  of  noble  birth,  a  native  of  the South  of  Italy,  that  he  distributed  all  his worldly  goods  to  the  poor,  became  a  priest, and  afterwards  a  monk  in  the  Abbey  of  Monte Vergine.  There  he  worked  miracles,  and eventually  (it  would  appear  under  the  Pontificate of  Pope  Adrian  IV),  was  chosen  Bishop  of Nusco.  The  year  of  his  death  is  given  as a.d.  1193.  But  there  are  reputable  authors who  date  his  Episcopate  a  century  earlier. AMATUS  (AMAT,  AME,  AIME)  Bp.  (Sept.  12) (7th  cent.)  The  son  of  noble  and  pious Frankish  parents,  he  resolved  to  devote  his life  to  the  service  of  God  in  the  priestly  ministry. His  ability  and  virtues  so  impressed  the  clergy of  Sens  that,  against  his  will,  he  was  appointed their  Bishop.  But  he  had  enemies  who  made false  accusations  against  him  to  King  Thierry III.  The  latter  banished  him  to  the  monastery of  St.  Fursey  at  Peronne,  and  afterwards  to Breuil  in  Flanders,  where  he  died  a.d.  690. The  church  of  St.  Ame  at  Douai  possesses  a portion  of  his  relics.  It  appears  certain  that St.  Amatus  died  in  exile  in  Flanders  as  above mentioned  ;  but  there  is  considerable  difficulty in  reconciling  the  accounts  given  of  his  life. Thus,  Alban  Butler  and  others  hold  that  he was  Bishop  not  of  Sens  in  France,  but  of  Sion in  the  Valais,  and  that  the  monastery  of  his exile  was  Luxeuil  and  not  Peronne. AMATUS  (AIME,  AME)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  13) (7th  cent.)  Known  as  St.  Amatus  of  Grenoble from  the  place  of  his  birth.  In  his  youth  he entered  the  monastery  of  St.  Maurice  in  Valais, and  at  the  age  of  thirty  retired  into  a  hermitage, where  his  reputation  for  a  life  of  penance  and prayer,  privileged  with  the  grace  of  miracleworking,  drew  the  attention  of  St.  Eustathius, Abbot  of  Luxeuil,  who  persuaded  him  to  join his  community.  During  his  ensuing  Apostolic labours  in  Lorraine,  he  converted  a  rich  and powerful  baron,  by  name  Rommaric,  who became  the  founder  of  the  famous  Abbey  of Rombers  or  Remiremont,  and  was  afterwards himself  venerated  as  a  Saint.  St.  Amatus ruled  this  Abbey  for  many  years,  and  established there  the  difficult  pious  practice  of  the  "  Laus perennis  "  or  Perpetual  Praise,  which  consisted in  the  maintaining  in  the  Church  an  uninterrupted service  of  Psalmody  and  Prayer,  day and  night.  St.  Amatus  died  in  the  year  627, and  at  his  own  request  was  buried  just  outside the  church  door.  Later,  his  remains  were suitably  enshrined  under  one  of  the  altars  of the  same  church. AMBICUS,  VICTOR  and  JULIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  3) (4th  cent.)  Christians  who  suffered  death  at Nicomedia,  the  Imperial  residence  of  Diocletian, on  account  of  their  religion,  probably in  the  first  years  of  the  fourth  century. AMBROSE  (St.)  Conf.  (March  20)  
(13th  cent.) A  Saint  of  Siena,  one  of  the illustrious  family  of  the  Sansedoni,  who  at  an B  17 

AMBROSE 
early  age  entered  the  Order  of  St.  Dominic. By  Order  of  Pope  Gregory  X,  he  preached  the Crusade,  in  his  age  a  thankless  task.  He  met with  better  success  in  reconciling  the  Church and  people  of  Siena  with  the  Holy  See.  He died  at  the  age  of  sixty-six,  A.D.  1286.  In  art he  is  represented  as  holding  in  his  hand  a  model of  his  native  city.  

AMBROSE  (St.)  Bp.,  Doctor  of  the Church.  (Dec.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  four  great  Fathers and  Doctors  of  the  Western  Church.  Aries, Lyons  and  Treves  dispute  the  honour  of  being his  birthplace.  On  the  death  of  his  father, his  mother  with  her  family,  consisting  of  her three  children,  St.  Marcellina,  her  daughter, who  devoted  herself  to  the  upbringing  of  her brothers,  and  the  two  boys,  Ambrose  and Satyrrus.  The  former,  early  distinguished  by his  talents,  soon  attracted  the  attention  of  the governing  powers,  and  had  scarcely  reached man's  estate  when  he  was  made  Prefect  of Liguria,  that  is,  Governor  of  Northern  Italy. The  death  soon  after  of  the  Archbishop  of Milan,  whose  Diocese  was  torn  in  pieces  by rival  factions,  necessitated  the  intervention of  the  Prefect  to  ensure  an  orderly  election  of a  successor.  It  is  said  that  in  the  midst  of the  tumult  the  voice  of  a  child  was  heard crying  out  "  Ambrose  for  Bishop,"  and  the  cry, at  once  taken  up  by  the  multitude,  was  later endorsed  by  the  Emperor  Valentinian  III. Ambrose,  however,  was  as  yet  only  a  catechumen, preparing  for  Baptism.  Nevertheless,  all objections  made  by  him  were  overruled.  He was  quickly  baptised,  confirmed,  ordained priest,  and  consecrated  Bishop  (Dec.  7,  A.D. 374).  Divesting  himself  of  all  his  wealth in  favour  of  the  Church  and  of  the  poor,  he applied  himself  assiduously  to  his  pastoral duties  and  to  the  study  of  the  Holy  Scriptures. Arianism  was  rampant  in  his  Diocese,  and  in his  efforts  to  eradicate  it  he  experienced  many a  fierce  and  bitter  struggle.  He  was  the champion  of  religious  liberty  in  an  age  of usurpation  of  authority  in  spirituals  by  the secular  powers.  His  courage  in  reproving  and  excluding from  the  church  services  even  the Emperor  Theodosius  the  Great,  guilty  of  the  cruel massacre  of  Thessalonica,  is  one  of  the  most remarkable  examples  of  Christian  heroism recorded  in  history.  His  writings  are  voluminous, and  in  matters  of  religious  doctrine still  constantly  appealed  to.  They  bear  eloquent testimony  to  his  virtues  and  learning.  He  is a  prominent  figure  in  all  histories  of  the  fourth century.  He  died  April  4,  A.D.  397,  and  was buried  by  the  side  of  the  Martyrs  SS.  Gervase and  Protase,  whose  relics  he  had  enslirined at  Milan.  In  St.  Peter's  in  Rome,  his  statue is  represented  as  holding  up,  together  with those  of  SS.  Augustine  (whom  he  had  converted and  baptised),  Athanasius  and  Chrysostom, the  Chair  of  the  Prince  of  the  Apostles.  

AMBROSE  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  A  centurion  in  the  Roman  army, who,  on  declaring  his  Faith  in  Christ,  was arrested  and  put  to  various  savage  tortures. Thrown  into  a  fiery  furnace,  as  had  happened to  the  three  holy  youths  at  Babylon,  he  remained unscathed.  Whereupon  he  was  made an  end  of  by  being  drowned  in  a  deep  well  at Ferentino  in  Central  Italy  (A.D.  303).  He  is represented  in  art  as  a  soldier  on  horseback.  

AMBROSE  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  16)  
(8th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Capuan  in the  See  of  Cahors  (South  of  France),  a  prelate ~>f  great  learning,  piety  and  zeal.  However, i  is  Episcopate  was  troubled  from  beginning to  end.  He  was  forced  several  times  to  take relYge  from  his  enemies  in  flight,  and  terminated his  career  as  a  hermit  in  a  solitude  near  Bourges, towards  the  close  of  the  eighth  century.  

AMBROSE  (St.)  (Nov.  2)  
(6th  /ent) The  Abbot  of  a  monastery  near Lyons,  afterwards  promoted  to  the  headship of  the  great  Abbey  of  Agaune,  or  St.  Moritz, in  Switzerland.  He  was  singularly  zealous in  regard  to  the  due  and  complete  celebration of  the  Church  services,  and  especially  for  the continuous  Psalmody,  day  and  night,  proper to  certain  exceptionally  austere  Religious Houses.  He  died  about  A.D.  516,  and  was buried  in  his  Abbey  Church.

Otherwise  St.  AMATOR.,  which  see.  

AMELBERGA  (AMELIA)  (St.)  V.  (July  10)  
(8th  cent.)  A  nun  of  Bilsea,  near  Liege, under  the  Abbess  St.  Landrada.  She  died  in her  monastery  (A.D.  772),  after  a  long  life  of prayer  and  penance  ;  but  was  buried  at  Tamise in  the  Ardennes,  where  she  had  built  a  church on  her  family  estates.  Her  relics  were  translated to  an  Abbey  in  the  neighbourhood  of Ghent,  towards  the  end  of  the  eleventh  century.

AMMON  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept,  3)  
(4th  cent.) Ammon, a deacon, was  put  to death under the Emperor Licinius  (a.d. 313) at  Heraclea  in  Thrace,  together  with  forty young  women  whom  he  had  converted  to Christianity. The executioners did St. Ammon to  death  by  placing  a  red-hot  helmet  on  his head.  These  Martyrs  are  especially  honoured in  the  Greek  Church,  but  have  had  from  ancient times a commemoration also in the West.  

AMMON, THEOPHILUS, NEOTERRUS and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  8)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Egyptian  Christians,  put to  death  at  Alexandria  ;  but  it  is  not  clear whether  they  were  previously  tried  and  condemned in  virtue  of  the  Imperial  edicts  against Christians,  or  suffered  at  the  hands  of  the  pagan mob.  The  names  of  the  twenty-two  Christians who  shared  the  martyrdom  of  the  three  abovenamed  are  given  by  the  Bollandists,  but  we have  neither  date  nor  particulars.  Possibly they  are  the  Martyrs  mentioned  by  Eusebius (Bk.  vi.  ch.  34),  quoting  St.  Dionysius  of Alexandria.  

AMMON  (St.)  Abbot.  (Oct.  4)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  famous  of  the Egyptian  Fathers  of  the  Desert.  His  cell  was on  Mount  Nitria,  where  Cassian  reckons  there were  at  the  time  fifty  monasteries  inhabited by  five  thousand  monks  or  hermits.  The working  of  many  miracles  is  attributed  to  him. He  died  A.D.  348,  at  the  ase  of  sixtv-two.  

AMMON.  ZENO, PTOLOMAEUS,  INGEN and  THEOPHILUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  20)  
(Date  uncertain.)  St.  Dionysius  of  Alexandria relates  how  a  group  of  soldiers,  named  as above,  Avere  present  when  a  Christian  on  his trial  at  Alexandria  appeared  to  be  on  the  point of  denying  his  Faith.  They  publicly  showed contempt  of  his  cowardice,  and  on  being  arrested professed  themselves  Christians.  They  were put  to  death  on  that  account.  The  date  is unknown,  and  they  may  possibly  be  identical with  the  group  of  Martyrs  in  Egypt  commemorated on  Sept.  8,  or  rather  have  been  included in  their  number.  

AMMONARIA,  MERCURIA,  DIONYSIA 
and  another  AMMONARIA  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  12) (3rd  cent.)  A  band  of  holy  women  of  Alexandria, who  suffered  as  Christians  about  the  same time  as  SS.  Alexander  and  Epimachus,  during the  Decian  persecution  (A.D.  250).  Mercuria is  described  as  an  aged  woman,  Dionysia  as the  mother  of  many  children,  and  the  two Ammonarias  as  young  girls.  They  were  all beheaded ;  but  no  mention  is  made  of  the previous  torture  so  customary  as  to  be  almost general  in  such  cases.

(Date  uncertain.)  A  group  of  forty  Christians registered  in  all  the  ancient  Martyrologies,  hut whether  put  to  death  in  Rome  itself,  as  stated in  the  Roman  Martyrology,  or  in  one  of  the provinces,  it  is  now  impossible  to  determine.

AMOS  (St.)  Prophet.  (March  31)  
(8th  cent.  B.C.)  One  of  the  Minor  Prophets, a  shepherd  of  Koa,  near  Bethlehem.  His prophecy  is  one  long  denunciation  of  evildoers. It  was  he  who  wrote  :  "I  am  not  a  prophet, nor  the  son  of  a  prophet ;  but  I  am  a  herdsman plucking  wild  figs "  (Amos  vii.  13).  The Eastern  tradition  concerning  him  is  that  he was  scourged,  and  afterwards  had  his  temples pierced  with  an  iron  spike.  The  Greeks  honour him  on  June  14.  

AMPELIUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  11)  
See  SS.  SATURNINUS,  DATIVUS, &c.  

AMPELIUS  and  CAIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  20)  
(4th  cent.) They  are  presumed  to  have  been Sicilians  and  to  have  been  two  of  the  numerous Martyrs  at  Messina,  in  the  persecution  under the  Emperor  Diocletian,  about  a.d.  302.  

AMPHIANUS  (APPIAN,  APIAN)  (St.)  (April  2)  
(4th  cent.)  A  native  of  Lycia  (Asia  Minor) who,  while  still  a  youth,  when  arrested  and accused  of  being  a  Christian,  had  the  hardihood to  reproach  his  judge  with  being  an  idolater. The  Martyr  was  partially  burned  at  the  stake, and  then,  still  living,  thrown  into  the  sea  at Caesarea  in  Palestine  (A.D.  305).  

AMPHIBALUS  (St.)  M.  (June  24)  
(4th  cent.)  The  cleric  or  priest  of  Verulam, who  was  a  fellow-sufferer  with  St.  Alban  (a.d. 304  about)  in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian, which,  notwithstanding  the  tolerant  clemency of  the  Caesar  Constantius  Chlorus,  made  some victims  in  Britain.  His  real  name  is  unknown  ; that  of  Amphibalus,  commonly  given  to  him, may  be  derived  from  the  circumstance  that St.  Alban  disguised  him  for  a  time  In  his  own cloak  or  "  caracalla  "  (amphibalus).  His  relics, with  those  of  nine  Christians  who  were  put  to death  in  the  neighbourhood  at  about  the  same time,  were  enshrined  in  St.  Alban's  Abbey (a.d.  1178).  

AMPHILOCHIUS  (St.)  M.  (March  27)  
See  SS.  PHILETUS,  LYDIA, &c.  

AMPHILOCHIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  22)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Asiatic  who  gave  up  a  promising career  as  a  lawyer  to  become  a  solitary,  and was  afterwards  elected  Bishop  of  Iconium. He  was  of  great  service  to  St.  Basil,  assisting and  supporting  that  Saint  in  the  government of  the  Church  of  Cappadocia.  St.  Gregory  of Nazianzen,  his  intimate  friend,  describes  him  as a  pontiff  without  reproach.  He  attended  the great  Council  of  Constantinople  (a.d.  381), where  he  met  St.  Jerome.  As  a  theologian  he vindicated  the  Divinity  of  the  Holy  Ghost  against the  followers  of  Macedonius,  and  it  was  to  him that  St.  Basil  dedicated  his  work  on  the  Third Person  of  the  Blessed  Trinity.  St.  Amphilochius  presided  over  a  Council  at  Sida  in  Pamphylia ;  and  his  teachings  are  quoted  with approval  by  later  Synods.  The  date  of  his death  was  probably  one  of  the  closing  years  of the  fourth  century,  for  St.  Jerome  speaks  of him  as  still  living  a.d.  392.  

AMPHION  (St.)  Bp.  (June  11)  
(4th  cent.)  Sometime  Bishop  of  Epiphania in  Cilicia,  he  was  chosen  by  the  clergy  of  the important  See  of  Nicomedia  to  replace  their former  Pastor,  the  Arian  heretic  Euscbius. St.  Amphion  attended  various  Councils  of  the period,  and  was  one  of  the  Fathers  of  the  General Council  of  Nicaea.  The  year  of  his  death  is  not well  ascertained.  

AMPLIATUS,  URBAN  and NARCISSUS (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  31)  
(1st  cent.)  These  Saints  are  the  disciples  of St.  Paul  mentioned  by  him  in  his  Epistle  to  the Romans  (xvi.  8,  9,  11).  Some  ancient  authors place  them  among  the  seventy-two  disciples chosen  as  preachers  of  the  Gospel  by  Our  Lord (Luke  x.  19).  Tradition  has  it  that  they subsequently  attached  themselves  to  the Apostle  St.  Andrew,  and  ultimately  were  put to  death  at  the  instigation  of  the  Jews.  They are  also  reported  to  have  been  Bishops  in Greece  and  the  Balkan  countries.  The  Greek Church  claimed  to  possess  their  relics  at  Constantinople.  

ANACHARIUS  (AUNAIRE)  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  25)  
(6th  cent.)  Of  a  rich  and  noble  family  at Orleans,  who  spent  his  youth  at  the  Court  of Gunthram,  King  of  Burgundy.  Renouncing the  world,  he  placed  himself  under  the  guidance of  St.  Syagrius,  Bishop  of  Autun  ;  and  on  the death  of  St.  iEtherius  was  chosen  as  his  successor in  the  See  of  Auxerre  (a.d.  572).  He attended  the  Councils  of  Paris  (a.d.  573)  and  of Macon  (a.d.  583).  In  a  special  Synod  (a.d. 585)  he  added  several  disciplinary  statutes  to those  already  framed  by  the  Councils.  He  died A.D.  650.  

ANACLETUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (July  13)  
(2nd  cent.)  According  to  the  Liber  Pontificalis,  St.  Anacletus  was  ordained  priest  by St.  Peter.  His  identity  with  St.  Cletus  has been  the  subject  of  great  discussion,  but  whereas the  latter  was  a  Roman,  St.  Anacletus  was  an Athenian,  according  to  the  Catalogus  Felicianus. The  Roman  Church  has  always  distinguished the  two  Popes,  keeping  the  Feast  of  St.  Cletus on  April  26  and  that  of  St.  Anacletus  on  July  13. St.  Anacletus  is  styled  a  Martyr  in  the  ancient Martyrologies,  and  is  said  to  have  suffered during  the  persecution  of  Trajan  (a.d.  107).  

ANANIAS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  25)  
(1st  cent.)  The  disciple  at  Damascus  who baptised  St.  Paul  (Acts  ix.),  and  who,  tradition tells  us,  afterwards  became  a  zealous  propagator of  the  Christian  Faith,  for  which  in  the  end  he was  arrested,  scourged,  put  to  the  torture, and  at  last  stoned  to  death.  

♦ANANIAS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  25)  
(3rd cent.)  Martyrs  in  Phoenicia under Diocletian  (A.D.  298).  St.  Ananias  is  said  to have  been  a  priest,  and  the  seven  who  suffered with  him  Christian  soldiers.  

ANANIAS  (St.)  M.  (April  21)  

See  SS.  SIMEON,  ABDECHALAS, &c.  

ANANIAS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  1)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  Roman  Martyrology locates  his  passion  at  Arbela  in  Persia  ;  others at  Arbela  (Erbel)  in  Assyria,  while  the  Greeks maintain  that  he  was  martyred  in  Greece. The  Greek  Menology  relates  that  whilst  expiring under  the  blows  of  the  executioners  he  said to  those  around  him  :  "  I  see  a  ladder  reaching up  to  Heaven,  and  men  clothed  with  rays  of light  inviting  me  to  the  Kingdom  of  Joy."  

ANANIAS  (St.)  (Dec.  16)  
(7th  cent.  B.C.)  Otherwise  SIDRACH (SHADRACH).  One of the three children cast  into  the  fiery  furnace  by  order  of  King Nabuchodonosor  (Dan.  i.  iii.).  

ANASTASIA  (St.)  M.  (April  15)  
See  SS.  BASILISSA  and  ANASTASIA.  

ANASTASIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  28)  
(3rd  cent.)  According  to  the  Roman  Martyrology this  Saint  is  called  "the  Elder,"  to distinguish  her  from  the  Roman  Martyr  of  the same  name  but  of  a  later  generation.  She was  brought  before  Probus,  during  the  persecution of  Valerian,  and  after  undergoing  the  most frightful  tortures  and  outrages,  was  beheaded 
19 

ANASTASTA 
(A.D.  253).  Cyril,  a  bystander,  gave  her  water to  drink,  and  received  as  his  reward  a  Martyr's crown.  St.  Anastasia  is  said  to  have  been  a nun  of  the  community  presided  over  by  St. Sophia,  by  whom  she  was  buried.  She  appears to  have  been  a  Greek,  though  there  are  not wanting  hagiographers  who  identify  her  with the  Roman  Martyr  above  mentioned  who  is far  better  known.  

ANASTASIA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  24)  
(4th  cent.)  This  famous  Roman  matron  is commemorated  daily  in  the  Canon  of  the  Mass. Particulars  about  her  are  given  in  the  alleged Acts  of  St.  Chrysogonus  the  Martyr,  stated  to have  been  her  spiritual  director.  She  was  of noble  birth,  and  on  the  death  of  her  husband devoted  all  her  time  and  wealth  to  the  seeking out  and  succouring  the  poor,  more  especially the  persecuted  Christians.  She  followed  St. Chrysogonus  into  Illyria  when  that  holy  priest was  carried  thither  as  a  prisoner ;  but  was herself  seized  and  imprisoned,  to  be  in  the  end put  to  the  torture  and  burned  alive.  She suffered  under  Diocletian  (A.D.  304).  The scene  of  her  martyrdom  was  the  Island  of Palmarola  off  the  Gulf  of  Gaeta,  where  about the  same  time  two  hundred  and  seventy  other Christians  of  both  sexes  obtained  their  crown in  various  ways.  Her  body  was  taken  back  to Rome,  and  a  famous  church  was  there  dedicated in  her  honour.  In  it  the  Popes  have  been  accustomed to  celebrate  a  Mass  yearly  on  Christmas Day.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  A  companion  in  martyrdom  of St.  Julian  of  Antioch,  and  said  to  have  been previously  by  him  miraculously  raised  from  the dead.  An  old  English  Martyrology  narrates the  legend  as  follows :  "  This  Julian  awoke from  death  a  heathen,  who  was  afterwards baptised.  This  man  told  such  a  mournful  tale about  the  way  to  Hell  as  never  came  to  man before  nor  after  since."  The  year  311  under Maximin  Daza  is  given  as  a  probable  date  of the  martyrdom  of  St.  Anastasius.  

ANASTASIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  (Jan.  11)  
(6th  cent.)  St.  Anastasius  was  a  monk  of Mount  Soracte  near  Viterbo  (Central  Italy), who  had  formerly  been  a  notary  of  the  Roman Church.  St.  Gregory  relates  that  on  the  day of  his  death  (a.d.  570)  he  heard  a  heavenly voice  calling :  "  Anastasius,  come."  Several of  his  fellow-monks  whose  names  were  also called  out,  also  died  on  the  same  day. ANASTASIUS  THE  SINAITE  (St.)  (April  21) (7th  cent.)  An  Anchorite  in  Palestine, author  of  several  ascetical  works  of  considerable value.  He  took  part  on  the  Catholic  side  in the  controversies  of  his  time,  and  at  Alexandria engaged  successfully  in  public  disputations with  the  Eutychian  heretics.  He  is  styled "  The  Sinaite  "  from  his  having  inhabited  a hermitage  on  Mount  Sinai,  where  he  died  about A.D.  678.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  22)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Persian  monk  who  suffered agonies  from  the  most  savage  and  prolonged torture,  and  was  finally  beheaded  because  of his  religion  by  Cnosroas,  King  of  Persia  (A.D. 628).  His  head  was  brought  to  Rome  and deposited  in  a  church  dedicated  to  him  and  St. Vincent,  the  Spanish  Martyr.  Hence,  the  great veneration  in  which  he  is  held  in  the  West. In  the  Acts  of  the  Seventh  Oecumenical  Council (A.D.  786),  the  Acts  of  St.  Anastasius  are  mentioned. They  are  believed  to  be  the  composition of  a  fellow  monk  of  his  who  followed  him  into Persia.  With  St.  Anastasius  seventy  other Christians  are  said  to  have  been  put  to  death.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  21)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Patriarch  of  Antioch  and  a resolute  opponent  of  the  Emperor  Justinian, whom  he  rebuked  on  account  of  his  various errors  and  misdeeds.  Justinian  threatened  the Saint  with  exile  and  deposition.  This  menace 20 

was  put  into  execution  by  Justinian's  nephew and  successor,  Justin  II.  St.  Anastasius  was only  recalled  after  twenty-three  years  of banishment.  He  died  A.D.  598.  This  Saint is  wrongly  styled  "  the  Sinaite  "  by  Baronius. Anastasius  the  Sinaite  was  never  a  Bishop.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  Pope.  (April  27)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth,  who  became Pope  in  the  year  398.  He  is  noted  for  the  zeal with  which  he  repressed  the  spreading  errors  of Origenism.  St.  Jerome  describes  him  as  "  a man  of  holy  life  and  rich  in  his  very  poverty." He  passed  away  A.D.  402.  

ANASTASIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  11) (3rd  cent.)  A  tribune  in  the  army  of  the Emperor  Decius,  whose  duty  it  became  to  carry out  the  sentences  pronounced  on  the  Christians on  account  of  their  religion.  Moved  by  the courage  under  torture  of  St.  Venantius,  St. Anastasius  was  converted  to  Christianity,  and together  with  his  wife,  children  and  some members  of  his  household,  was  instructed  and baptised  by  St.  Porphyrius.  Shortly  after  the death  of  the  latter,  Anastasius  and  his  family were  arrested  and  beheaded  (a.d.  251).  Their relics  are  in  the  church  of  St.  Venantius  at Camerino  (Central  Italy).  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  20)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Brescia  in  Lombardy who,  by  his  successful  preaching,  is  said  to  have greatly  contributed  to  the  conversion  of  the Lombard  nation  from  Arianism.  The  year 610  is  given  as  that  of  his  death.  A  solemn translation  of  his  relics  was  celebrated  by St.  Charles  Borromeo  A.D.  1604.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  30)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Pavia  in  Lombardy, commonly  called  St.  Anastasius  II,  to  distinguish him  from  one  of  his  predecessors  of  the same  name  who  flourished  in  the  fourth  century. St.  Anastasius  was  a  convert  from  Arianism, but  distinguished  himself  by  his  zeal  as  a  Bishop for  the  purity  of  the  Faith  of  his  flock,  and  by his  pastoral  virtues  and  ability.  He  died A.D.  680.  

ANASTASIUS,  FELIX  and  DIGNA  (SS.) MM.  (June  14)  
(9th  cent.)  Anastasius,  a  priest  of  Cordova in  Spain,  was  put  to  death  as  a  Christian, together  with  St.  Felix,  a  monk  of  Aicala,  by one  of  the  persecuting  Mohammedan  Caliphs (A.D.  857).  With  them  is  associated  the  name of  St.  Digna,  a  Christian  maiden,  who  was  a witness  of  their  martyrdom  and  herself  demanded from  the  judge  to  share  their  fate.  The  bodies of  all  three  were  burned,  and  the  ashes  thrown into  the  river  Guadalquivir.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  29)  
See  SS.  MARCELLUS  and  ANASTASIUS.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  13)  
(7th  cent.)  Two  Saints  of  this  name  are mentioned  as  fellow-disciples  and  companions of  St.  Acacius.  In  honour  of  one  of  them  the Greeks  celebrate  another  festival  on  Jan.  21. One,  Anastasius,  was  a  monk,  the  other  a  Roman priest,  apocrisiarius  or  legate  of  the  Pope  of the  time.  The  Monothelite  heresy,  favoured by  the  Byzantine  Court,  was  giving  great  trouble to  the  Church  at  the  time,  and  both  the  Saints were  imprisoned  and  eventually  banished. Worn  out  by  sufferings,  the  one  and  the  other died  in  exile,  about  the  year  662.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  17)  
(6th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  a  Syrian  who, coming  to  Italy,  led  the  life  of  a  hermit  in  a solitary  place  near  Perugia.  Promoted  to  the Bishopric,  he  is  described  as  a  "  most  humble and  virtuous  prelate,  well  versed  in  Ecclesiastical doctrine,  a  lover  of  the  poor,  zealous  in Divine  Worship  and  a  shepherd  watchful  over his  flock,  exposed  to  the  snares  of  Arian  heretics who  were  numerous  in  the  neighbourhood." During  the  invasion  of  Totila,  he  was  wonderfully preserved,  and  survived  to  encourage  and aid  his  people  in  the  work  of  rebuilding  their 
ANDREW 

houses  and  churches  demolished  by  the  barbarians. He  is  believed  to  have  died  in  the year  553.  Owing  to  the  many  miracles  wrought at  his  tomb,  the  inhabitants  built  a  magnificent chapel,  which  they  dedicated  in  his  honour. ANASTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  21)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  military  tribune  (cornicularius)  who,  on  beholding  the  courage  of  the Christian  youth,  St.  Aeapitus,  tortured  for  his Faith,  cried  out :  "  The  God  of  Agapitus  is my  God."  On  that  account  he  was  arrested by*  order  of  the  Emperor  Aurelian  and  put  to death  (a.d.  274)  at  a  place  called  Salone, twelve  miles  from  Praeneste  or  Palestrina,  near Rome.  The  theory  advanced  by  some  that this  martyrdom  took  place  at  Salona  in  Dalmatia has  not  been  able  to  withstand  the  contrary evidence  brought  against  it.  A  St.  Anastasius of  Salona  in  Dalmatia  is  commemorated  on Sept.  7. ANASTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  A  fuller  of  Aquileaia,  not  far from  Venice,  who  crossed  into  Dalmatia  during the  persecution  under  Diocletian.  Far  from concealing  his  adherence  to  the  proscribed Christian  religion,  he  painted  a  conspicuous cross  on  his  door  at  Salona.  He  was  seized and  drowned  (a.d.  304).  His  body  was  recovered by  some  fishermen,  and  after  the  peace of  the  Church  enshrined  at  Spalatro.  

ANASTASIUS,  PLACIDUS,  GENESIUS and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  11)  
(Date  unknown.) A  band  of  Martyrs put to  death  for  the  Faith,  probably  in  Sicily; but excepting  their  names  (that  is,  some  of  them)  nothing  has  come  down  to  us  concerning  them.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  5)  
(Date  unknown.) A  Saint  of  this  name  is commemorated  on  Dec.  5,  in  the  Martyrologies, but  neither  the  place  nor  the  time  of  his  passion is  discoverable.  

ANASTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  19)  
See  SS  CYRTACUS,  PAULILLUS, &c. ANASTASIUS  THE  YOUNGER  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Dec.  21)  
(7th  cent.)  The  successor  of  another  St. Anastasius  (April  21)  in  the  See  of  Antioch. He  devoted  himself  to  the  conversion  of  the Jews,  numerous  and  influential  at  Antioch, and  eventually  was  attacked  by  them  and terribly  injured.  He  died  in  consequence  of the  hurts  he  had  received  (a.d.  610).  He  is sometimes  styled  St.  Anastasius  the  Younger. To  him  is  attributed  a  translation  into  Greek of  the  work  of  St.  Gregory  the  Great  on  the duties  of  a  pastor  of  souls.  There  is  also  a treatise  on  Faith  bearing  his  name  as  author.  

ANATHALON  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  25)  
(1st  cent.)  Although  there  exists  a  certain amount  of  doubt  as  to  the  credibility  of  the Milanese  tradition  that  their  first  Bishop  was St.  Barnabas  the  Apostle,  it  appears  to  be historically  certain  that,  during  his  lifetime,  his disciple  St.  Anathalon  exercised  the  functions of  Bishop,  not  only  at  Milan,  but  also  at  Brescia, and  in  other  parts  of  Lombardy.  It  is  at  Brescia that  he  is  said  to  have  passed  away  (A.D.  61).  

ANATOLIA  and  AUDAX  (SS.)  MM.  (July  9)  
(3rd  cent.)  Anatolia,  a  Roman  maiden, with  her  sister  St.  Victoria,  was  denounced  as a  Christian  by  their  rejected  lovers,  Aurelian and  Eugene,  and  banished  from  Rome.  St. Anatolia  settled  in  a  small  town  near  Rieti, where  her  reputation  as  a  worker  of  miracles again  drew  attention  to  her,  and  she  was  put to  the  torture.  Audax,  one  of  the  guards  of the  prison  in  which  she  was  confined,  was  converted by  her,  and  the  two  were  beheaded on  the  same  day  (a.d.  250).

See  SS.  PHOTINUS,  JOSEPH, &c.  

ANATOLIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  native  of  Alexandria  in  Egypt, he  early  acquired  a  great  reputation  for  eloquence, learning  and  virtue.  Chosen  (a.d.  269) 

to  succeed  his  friend  St.  Eusebius  at  Laodicea in  Syria,  he  survived  till  the  eve  of  the  persecution under  Diocletian,  which  broke  out  in  the last  decade  of  the  third  century.  He  was  the author  of  some  theological  treatises  commended by  St.  Jerome,  together  with  other  works.

ANDEOLUS  (St.)  M.  (May  1)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  sub-deacon  and  disciple  of St.  Polycarp,  the  Martyr-Bishop  of  Smyrna, who  sent  him  into  France  to  preach  the  Gospel. After  forty-two  years  of  successful  Apostolate, he  was  seized  by  order  of  the  Emperor  Septimus Severus,  scourged  and  beheaded  (a.d.  208).  

ANDOCHIUS,  THYRSUS  and  FELIX  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  24)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  priest  Andochius  was  sent with  a  deacon,  by  name  Tyrsus,  into  Gaul  by St.  Polycarp,  Bishop  of  Smyrna.  Landing  at Marseilles,  they  journeyed  to  Lyons,  and finally  established  themselves  at  Autun  in  the house  of  a  rich  merchant  from  the  East  named Felix.  Their  host  not  only  assisted  them  in their  Apostolic  work,  but  shared  their  dangers and  sufferings,  and  Anally  their  triumph  (a.d. 179).  Their  relics  were  the  object  of  great veneration,  not  only  in  the  Diocese  of  Autun but  throughout  Gaul.  

ANDREW  CORSINI  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  4)  
(14th  cent.)  A  member  of  the  Corsini  family, one  of  the  most  illustrious  of  Florence.  After an  early  life  wasted  in  dissipation,  he  entered the  Carmelite  Order  (a.d.  1318).  For  forty years  he  spent  himself  in  doing  penance  and in  preaching.  He  was  then  chosen  Bishop  of Fiesole  (a  small  town  near  Florence).  As Bishop  he  redoubled  his  penances  and  prayers, nor  sought  any  respite  from  his  energetic  labours as  a  pastor  of  souls,  being  in  particular  remarkable for  his  charity  to  the  poor.  He  died Jan.  6,  a.d.  1373,  and  was  canonised  a.d.  162. Clement  XII  of  the  Corsini  family  built  a magnificent  chapel  dedicated  to  him  in  St.  John Lateran's  in  Rome,  and  his  Feast  is  kept  in  the Universal  Church  on  Feb.  4.  

ANDREW  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  26)  
(5th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Zenobius in  the  See  of  Florence.  He  continued  the Apostolic  work  of  his  predecessor  so  successfully that  he  cleansed  his  Diocese  from  all  vestiges of  idolatry.  He  died  a.d.  407. ANDREW  (St.)  M.  (May  15)

(17th  cent.)  A  Pole,  priest  of  the  Society of  Jesus,  who  laboured  for  many  years  at  the conversion  of  Heretics and bad Catholics  in Lithuania,  and  who,  on  account  of  his  zeal  and success,  was  cruelly  tortured  and  at  length  put to  death  by  the  Greek  schismatics  (A.D.  1657).  

♦ANDREW  and  BENEDICT  (SS.)  MM. (July  16) (11th cent.)  Two Polish hermits of the Camaldolese  Order,  who  served  God  in  Moravia and  Hungary,  living  lives  of  incredible  austerity, but  comforted  by  the  graces  of  high  contemplation. At  length,  assailed  by  marauders,  they won  the  crown  of  martyrdom  (a.d.  1020).  

♦ANDREW  OF  RINN  (St.)  M.  (July  22)  
(15th cent.)  A Tyrolese child, alleged to have  been  put  to  death  by  Jews  out  of  hatred of  Christianity  (A.D.  1462).  

ANDREW  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug 19)  
(4th  cent.)  A  tribune  in  the  Greek  army, who,  with  many  of  his  comrades,  was  converted to  the  true  Faith,  owing  to  a  miracle  which took  place  in  connection  with  a  victory  over the  Persians.  Accused  of  being  Christians, they  were  massacred  by  the  soldiers  of  the President  Seleucus,  in  the  defiles  of  Mount Taurus  in  Cilicia  (a.d.  300).  In  the  Church  of St.  Vincent  at  Brioude  (France)  some  of  the relics of these martyrs were venerated and became  the  object  of  an  annual  pilgrimage.  

♦ANDREW  OF  TUSCANY  (St.)  Conf.  (Aug.  22)  
(9th  cent.)  Of  Scottish  or  Irish  birth,  he accompanied  St.  Donatus  to  Italy,  and,  on  the latter  being  appointed  Bishop  of  Fiesole,  was ordained  deacon.  He  died  about  A.D.  880,  and is  honoured  as  a  Saint.  

ANDREW  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  29)  
See  SS.  HYPATIUS  and  ANDREW.  

ANDREW,  JOHN,  PETER  and  ANTONY (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  23)  
(10th  cent.)  According  to  the  Greek  Menology,  these  Saints  were  deported  from  Syracuse in  Sicily  to  Africa,  by  the  Mohammedans,  in their  time  masters  of  Sicily.  They  were  there subjected  to  savage  tortures,  and  in  the  end were  put  to  death,  about  A.D.  900.  

ANDREW  OF  CRETE  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  17)  
(8th  cent.)  A  native  of  Crete,  where  he  was living  the  life  of  a  Solitary  when  the  Byzantine Emperor  Constantine  Copronymus  published his  edict  against  the  venerating  of  Holy  Images. Fired  with  zeal  for  the  Catholic  doctrine,  St. Andrew  went  to  Constantinople  and  fearlessly denounced  the  Imperial  heresy,  going  so  far as  to  force  his  way  to  the  foot  of  the  Emperor's throne  and  boldly  to  reproach  Constantine  for his  impiety.  The  enraged  monarch  ordered him  to  be  seized  and  put  to  the  torture,  from the  effects  of  which  he  died,  A.D.  761.  

ANDREW  AVELLINO  (St.)  (Nov.  10)  
(17th  cent.)  Born  at  Castelnuovo  in  the Kingdom  of  Naples,  he  received  in  Baptism the  name  of  Lancelot,  but  changed  it  to  Andrew on  joining  the  Order  of  the  Theatines.  His zeal  and  eloquence  gained  for  him  the  special friendship  and  esteem  of  St.  Charles  Borromeo and  of  other  prominent  Ecclesiastics  of  his time.  Commissioned  to  reform  abuses  in Church  discipline  and  to  establish  houses  of his  Order  throughout  Italy,  he  laboured  all  his life  with  great  success  and  advantage  to  the Church.  His  preaching  was  helped  by  God with  the  working  of  many  miracles,  and  he  had the  gift  of  prophecy  in  a  remarkable  degree. Worn  out  at  last  with  fatigue  and  old  age,  he died  at  the  Altar  when  beginning  Mass  (Nov.  10, A.D.  1608),  being  then  in  his  eightieth  year. He  wrote  several  ascetical  works,  and  has  left some  volumes  of  sermons.  His  relics  are enshrined  in  the  Church  of  St.  Paul  at  Naples.  

ANDREW  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  28)  
(8th  cent.)  A  holy  Solitary,  one  of  those  who, with  St.  Stephen  the  Younger,  were  put  to death  by  Constantine  Copronymus  for  maintaining the  Catholic  doctrine  of  the  lawfulness of  honouring  holv  statues  and  pictures  (AD.  756).  

ANDREW  (St.)  Apostle.  (Nov.  30)  
(1st  cent.)  A  native  of  Bethsaida  in  Galilee, elder  brother  of  St.  Peter,  by  profession  a  fisherman. He  was  a  disciple  of  St.  John  the  Baptist, and  was  the  first  of  the  Apostles  to  be  called by  Christ.  There  is  no  certainty  as  to  the sphere  of  his  missionary  labours  after  the Ascension.  It  is,  however,  generally  agreed that  he  laboured  chiefly  in  Greece  and  in  the Balkan  countries.  The  Russians,  who  have taken  him  for  one  of  their  Patron  Saints,  assert that  in  his  travels  he  penetrated  at  least  as  far as  Poland.  Tradition  has  it  that  he  was crucified  (on  a  cross  of  the  shape  of  the  letter  X) at  Patras  in  Achaia  (Greece)  (A.D.  60)  during the  reign  of  Nero.  His  relics  were  enshrined at  Constantinople,  whence  St.  Gregory  the Great  (A.D.  590)  obtained  an  arm  for  his  monastery of  St.  Andrew  in  Rome.  Thither,  later, the  Apostle's  head  was  also  carried,  and  is venerated  in  St.  Peter's.  The  emblem  of  St. Andrew  usual  in  art  is  his  cross  (saltire).  

ANDRONICUS  and  ATHANASIA  (SS.)  (Oct.  9)  
(9th  cent.)  Husband  and  wife,  citizens  of Antioch  in  Syria,  where  the  former  was  a silversmith  or  banker.  On  the  death  of  their two  children,  they  agreed  to  separate,  and thenceforth  led  lives  of  penance  and  prayer in  one  of  the  solitudes  of  Upper  Egypt.  Their pilgrimages  to  Jerusalem  may  account  for  the special  veneration  in  which  they  were  held  in Palestine.  The  precise  dates  of  their  deaths are  unknown.  

ANDRONICUS,  TARACHUS  and  PROBUS (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  The  triumph  of  these  Martyrs has  a  prominent  place  in  the  Greek  and  Roman Martyrologies.  Their  Acts  are  universally accepted  as  genuine  and  contain  the  particulars of  the  triple  examination  which  they  underwent in  the  towns  of  Tarsus,  Mopsuestia  and  Anazarbus  in  Cilicia,  together  with  an  authentic  report of  their  passion  written  down  by  Christian  eyewitnesses. The  latter  recovered  their  bodies and  buried  them.  They  were  beheaded  after unflinchingly  undergoing  excruciating  tortures (A.D.  304),  under  Galerius,  the  colleague  of  the Emperor  Diocletian.

♦ANGELA  OF  FOLIGNO  (Bl.)  Widow.  (Jan.  4)  
(14th  cent.)  A  penitent  of  the  Third  Order of  St.  Francis,  born  at  Foligno,  near  Assisi, who  after  her  husband's  death,  followed  by  that of  her  children,  sought  God's  mercy  and  pardon for  her  past  sins,  spending  many  years  in  prayers and  fastings.  Her  wonderful  Book  of  Revelations and  Visions  has  been  often  printed  ;  and there  has  been  issued  a  modern  translation  of it  into  English.  Blessed  Angela  died  a.d.  1309, at  the  age  of  fifty-one,  and  was  beatified  in  the year  1693.  

ANGELA  DEI  MERICI  (St.)  V.  (May  31)  
(16th  cent.)  The  foundress  of  the  Ursuline Order  of  nuns,  which  originally  was  composed of  women  vowed  to  devote  themselves  to  the care  of  the  distressed  of  their  sex,  under  the patronage  of  St.  Ursula.  It  has  since  developed into  a  Congregation  of  Sisters  spread  over  the world,  and  singularly  popular  in  North  America as  school-mistresses.  St.  Angela  was  born  near Brescia  in  Lombardy,  and  passed  to  a  better life  four  years  after  the  definite  establishment of  her  Order  (A.D.  1474).  She  was  canonised A.D.  1807.  The  day  of  her  death  was  Jan.  27  ; but  the  Holy  See  has  ordered  her  Feast  to  be kept  on  May  31.  Her  emblem  is  a  ladder raised  on  high,  up  which  maidens  are  ascending.  

ANGELUS  (St.)  M.  (May  5)  
(13th  cent.)  A  native  of  Jerusalem  and  the son  of  converted  Jews.  With  his  brother,  he entered  the  Monastery  of  Mount  Carmel  and later  retired  to  a  hermit's  cell  in  the  desert. John,  his  brother,  became  Patriarch  of  Jerusalem, while  Angelus  received  a  Divine  call  to labour  for  the  conversion  of  the  Jews  in  Sicily. There,  he  led  many  of  these  to  embrace  Christianity. He  met  his  death  at  the  hands  of assassins  hired  by  a  certain  Count  Berengarius, whom  he  had  rebuked  for  the  wickedness  of his  life  (A.D.  1225).  In  art  he  is  represented with  three  crowns  at  his  feet,  signifying  chastity, eloquence  and  martyrdom.  

ANGELUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  13)  
(13th  cent.)  One  of  seven  Franciscan  Friars who,  inspired  by  the  example  of  the  five  brethren of  their  Order,  put  to  death  for  the  Faith  in Morocco  on  Jan.  16,  1220,  obtained  the  permission and  blessing  of  St.  Francis  to  follow in  their  footsteps.  They  arrived  at  Ceuta on  the  African  coast,  Sept.  29,  1221.  After preaching  in  the  suburbs  for  three  days,  they entered  the  town,  and  were  there  assailed by  the  populace  and  brought  before  the  cadi or  magistrate.  He,  seeing  their  coarse  and strange  habit  and  their  tonsure,  judged  them to  be  madmen  and  put  them  in  irons  for  eight days.  Eventually  they  were  beheaded,  Oct.  13, 1221.  

♦ANGILBERT  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  18)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Prankish  nobleman,  married to  a  daughter  of  Charlemagne,  and  a  distinguished and  successful  defender  of  his  country against  the  marauding  Norsemen.  Both  he and  his  wife  elected  to  end  their  days  in  religion. St.  Angilbert  died,  Abbot  of  the  monastery  of St.  Riquier,  A.D.  813.

ANIANUS  OF  ALEXANDRIA  (St.)  Bp.  (April  25)  
(1st  cent.)  The  disciple  and  successor  of St.  Mark  the  Evangelist  at  Alexandria.  He  is said  to  have  been  originally  a  poor  shoemaker, and  to  have  been  cured  of  a  diseased  hand  and converted  to  Christianity  by  St.  Mark.  St. Anianus  died  about  a.d.  86.  

ANIANUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  10)  
See  SS.  DEMETRIUS,  ANIANUS, &c.  

ANIANUS  (AGNAN,  AIGNAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  17) (5th  cent.)  Born  at  Vienne  (Dauphine)  of pious  and  noble  parents  who  were  Hungarian refugees  from  the  Arian  persecution  raging  in their  own  country,  he  retired  in  his  boyhood to  a  secluded  cave  where  he  spent  his  time  in prayer,  study  and  penitential  exercises,  until the  fame  of  St.  Evurtius,  Bishop  of  Orleans, reached  him.  Under  the  direction  of  this  holy prelate,  he  was  prepared  for  the  priesthood, and  after  ordination  was  appointed  Abbot  of the  monastery  of  St.  Laurence  in  the  environs of  the  city.  Later  he  was  promoted  to  be Bishop  coadjutor  of  Orleans.  When  Attila the  Hun  appeared  before  its  walls,  Anianus, by  his  courage  in  facing  the  barbarian,  saved the  town  and  its  inhabitants.  He  died  two  years later,  a.d.  453.  King  Robert  of  France,  some five  hundred  years  afterwards,  built  a  noble church  at  Orleans  in  honour  of  St.  Anianus,  in which  the  relics  of  the  Saint  were  enshrined, but  in  the  sixteenth  century  they  were  profaned and  destroyed  by  the  Calvinist  insurgents. He  is  represented  in  art  as  praying  on  the  top of  the  walls  of  Orleans,  against  which  are crowding  a  multitude  of  Huns.  

ANICETUS  (St.)  Pope.  (April  17)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Syrian,  who  succeeded  St. Pius  I  on  the  Chair  of  St.  Peter  (a.d.  162), a  year  after  the  death  of  the  Emperor  Antoninus Pius.  He  defended  the  Faith  with  much  zeal and  ability  against  Valentinus,  Marcian  and other  Gnostic  heretics  of  that  age.  He  welcomed St.  Polycarp  of  Smyrna  to  Rome,  whither  that Saint  had  repaired  in  order  to  settle  with  the Pope  the  vexed  question  of  the  date  of  Easter. After  a  comparatively  short  Pontificate  he  is said  to  have  been  put  to  death  by  order  of  the Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius,  whose  philosophical leanings  did  not  hinder  him  from  oppressing the  Christians  then  fast  growing  in  numbers and  influence.  

ANICETUS,  PHOTINUS,  and  OTHERS (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  12)  
(4th  cent.)  Martyred  at  Nicomedia,  on  the shores  of  the  Sea  of  Marmora,  the  favourite residence  of  the  Emperor  Diocletian  (a.d.  304). SS.  Anicetus  and  Photlnus  were  brothers,  or (as  others  say)  uncle  and  nephew.  They,  with several  other  Christians,  were  put  to  the  torture and  afterwards  burned  at  the  stake  A  church in  which  their  relics  were  enshrined  was  afterwards built  on  the  island  of  Daphnos,  between Lesbos  and  Samos,  in  the  Aegean  Sea.  The Greek  Menology  gives  a  detailed  account  of their  martyrdom,  and  the  account  is  corroborated by  independent  MSS.  now  in  the  Imperial Library  at  Vienna.  

ANNA  (St.)  Widow.  (Sept.  1)  
(First  cent )  A  prophetess,  the  daughter  of Phanuel,  of  the  tribe  of  Aser.  After  seven  years of  married  life  she  consecrated  her  widowhood to  the  service  of  God  in  the  Temple  of  Jerusalem, where  she  remained  night  and  day  in  prayer and  fasting.  At  the  age  of  eighty-four  she beheld  the  Presentation  of  the  Child  Jesus  in the  Temple  (Luke  ii.  36-38).  In  the  Greek Church  she  is  honoured  on  Feb.  3.  

ANNE  (St.)  Mother  of  Our  Blessed  Lady.  (July  26)  
(1st  cent.)  SS.  Joachim  and  Anne,  both  of the  tribe  of  Juda  and  of  the  Royal  House  of David,  are venerated  by  the  Church  as  the Earents  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  Mary  It  is elieved  that  Mary  was  their  only  child,  and the  Mary  mentioned  in  the  Gospels  as  the  sister of  the  Mother  of  God  wa3  in  reality  only  her cousin,  such  manner  of  speaking  being  not unusual  in  the  East.  Holy  Scriptine  makes no  mention  of  SS.  Joachim  and  Anne;  but they  have  been  honoured  by  the  Church  \s Saints  from  early  times.  Churches  were dedicated  under  their  patronage,  and  the Fathers,  especially  those  of  the  Oriental Churches,  dilate  on  their  privileges.  The  relics of  St.  Anne  are  said  to  have  been  brought from  Palestine  to  Constantinople  in  the  eighth century.  St.  Anne  is  usually  represented  as teaching  her  little  daughter  to  read  the  Scriptures.  

ANNO  (HANNO)  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  4)  
(11th  cent.)  A  German  nobleman  who  renounced a  promising  military  career  to  become a  priest.  His  distinction  in  sacred  and  profane studies  attracted  the  attention  of  the  Emperor, Henry  III,  who  summoned  him  to  his  court and  found  in  him  a  wise  adviser.  Raised  to the  dignity  of  Archbishop  of  Cologne,  he  proved himself  a*  zealous  Pastor  of  souls.  On  the death  of  Henry  III,  his  widow,  the  Empress Agnes,  induced  St.  Anno  to  act  as  Regent during  the  minority  of  her  son,  the  Emperor Henry  IV.  This  misguided  young  man, however,  resenting  the  remonstrances  of  St. Anno,  occasioned  by  the  tyrannical  form  of government  he  affected,  removed  the.  holy prelate  from  his  Episcopal  city,  though  constrained by  popular  clamour  speedily  to  restore him.  Nevertheless,  he  persecuted  the  Saint to  the  day  of  the  latter's  death  (Dec.  4,  a.d. 1075),  Such  was  St.  Anno's  charity  to  the  poor that,  on  his  deathbed,  he  was  found  to  be destitute  of  the  wherewithal  to  purchase  food and  medicine.  He  was  interred  in  the  Abbey Church  of  Siegberg.  

ANSANO  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  3)  
Otherwise  St.  AUXANUS,  which  see.  

ANSANUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  1)  
(4th  cent.)  A  member  of  the  Roman  Patrician family  of  the  Anicii,  who,  when  only  twelve years  old,  secretly  asked  and  received  Baptism. His  father  on  discovering  that  his  boy  had become  a  Christian  was  so  enraged  that  he  did not  hesitate  himself  to  delate  him  to  the persecuting  Emperor  Diocletian.  Ansanus, however,  contrived  to  escape  from  Rome, and  took  refuge  at  Bagnorea,  and  afterwards at  Siena,  wh^re  he  was  instrumental  in  drawing many  Pagans  to  Christianity.  He  was  at  last arrested  and  condemned  to  die  at  the  stake. But,  by  a  miracle,  he  emerged  unharmed  from the  flames  and  was  in  fine  beheaded  (a.d.  303).  

ANSBERT  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  9)  
(7th  cent.)  The  Chancellor  of  the  Merovingian King  Clotalre  III.  His  wife,  having with  his  consent  retired  to  a  convent,  he  himself took  the  monastic  habit  in  the  Abbey  of  Fontenelle  ;  and,  on  the  death  of  St.  Ouen,  was  chosen Archbishop  of  Rouen.  In  his  old  age  he resigned  his  See  and  went  to  die  in  a  monastery in  Hainault  (A.D.  095).  He  was  buried  at Fouteuelle.  

ANSCHAR.(ANSGAR,SCHARIES)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.3)  
(9th  cent.)  A  native  of  Amiens  (France), who  at  an  early  age  entered  the  Benedictine Abbey  of  Corbie,  under  the  Abbot  St.  Adelard. Sent  out  as  a  missionary,  he  preached  the Gospel  with  signal  success  in  Denmark,  Sweden and  North  Germany,  establishing  everywhere churches  and  schools.  He  became  the  first Archbishop  of  Hamburg,  and  Pope  Gregory  IV appointed  him  his  legate  in  the  North  of  Europe. Christianity  was  on  the  point  of  dying  out  in Scandinavia  when  St.  Anschar  devoted  himself to  the  work  of  re-kindling  the  Faith  among  the Norsemen.  He  himself  led  a  life  of  great austerity,  but  was  indefatigable  in  his  charity to  the  poor.  He  died  at  Bremen  a.d.  865.  

ANSELM  OF  LUCCA  (St.)  Bp.  (March  18)  
(11th  cent.)  A  native  of  Mantua,  appointed Bishop  of  Lucca  by  his  uncle  Pope  Alexander  II. He  resisted  zealously  the  encroachments  of Henry  IV,  the  German  Emperor  of  the  time. Forced  to  retire  from  his  Bishopric,  he  took refuge  with  the  monks  of  Cluny  in  France. St.  Leo  IX,  who  was  carrying  on  the  work  of his  predecessor,  Pope  St.  Gregory  VII,  recalled St.  Anselm  into  Italy,  appointing  him  his  legate, and  entrusting  to  him  the  administration  of several  Dioceses.  He  died  (a.d.  1086)  at Mantua,  of  which  citv  he  is  a  Patron  Saint.  

ANSELM  OF  CANTERBURY  (St.)  (April  21) Bp.,  Doctor  of  the  Church.  
(11th  cent.)  Born  of  noble  parents  at  Aosta in  Piedmont  (a.d.  1033),  he  gave  early  proof of  exceptional  talents.  Owing  to  a  disagreement with  his  father  he  left  Italy  in  his  youth for  France,  and  on  the  latter's  death,  became  a monk  of  Bee  in  Normandy,  where  later  he  succeeded Prior  Lanfranc  and  Abbot  Herluin  in their  respective  charges.  In  the  year  1093  he accepted  the  Archbishopric  of  Canterbury, but  four  years  later,  on  account  of  his  resistance to  the  tyranny  of  William  Rufus,  was  driven into  exile.  He  returned  to  France  and  thence passed  into  Italy,  where  he  assisted  at  several Councils  and  did  much  good  work  for  the Church.  On  the  death  of  King  William  Rufus, he  came  back  to  Canterbury  at  the  invitation of  the  new  king,  Henry  I.  But  the  claim  of that  monarch  to  invest  Bishops  with  their  Sees was  met  by  4nselm  with  unflinching  opposition. Hence,  a  second  exile,  terminated  by  a  triumphant return  (a.d.  1106).  St.  Anselm  died  in the  year  1109.  His  life  was  written  by  the monk  Eadmer.  His  works  are  numerous,  and he  is  especially  to  be  noted  as  the  forerunner in  Theology  and  Metaphysics  of  the  Scholastics of  the  succeeding  centuries.  In  ability  and learning  he  was  far  in  advance  of  the  uncultured age  in  which  his  lot  was  cast. ANSGAR  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  3)  

Otherwise  St.  ANSCHAR,  which  see. ANSOVINUS  (ANSEWIN)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  13)  
(9th  cent.)  Born  at  Camerino  in  Umbria (Central  Italy),  first  a  canon,  and  later  Bishop of  his  native  city,  he  acquired  a  great  and widespread  reputation  for  holiness  of  life  and  for personal  zeal.  He  died  a.d.  816,  and  was  forthwith honoured  as  a  Saint  by  his  sorrowing  flock.  

♦ANSTRUDE  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  17)  
(7th  cent.) A  holy  Abbess  of  Laon  in  France, and  a  strenuous  upholder  of  conventual  discipline, who  died  A.D.  688.

(9th cent.) A Benedictine monk, Abbot successively  of  several  important  monasteries in France.  He is locally honoured in that country  as  a  Saint.  He  died  A.D.  833.  

ANTHELMUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  26)  
(12th  cent.)  A  native  of  Savoy  who,  after being  Provost  of  a  Cathedral  Chapter,  entered the  Carthusian  Order  and  became  Prior  of  the Grande  Chartreuse.  During  the  Schism  of 1159  he  defended  the  rights  of  Pope  Alexander II  against  the  Anti-Pope  Octavian,  and  thereby incurred  the  enmity  of  the  German  Emperor, Frederick  Barbarossa.  The  Pope  consecrated him  Bishop  of  Belley,  and  sent  him  to  England as  his  legate  at  the  time  of  the  dispute  between King  Henry  II  and  St.  Thomas  A'Becket. There  he  rendered  important  services  to  the Church  and  to  the  country.  St.  Anthelmus died  dining  the  famine  which  devastated  a large  part  of  France  in  the  year  1178.  

ANTHEROS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Jan.  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Greek  who  occupied  the  Chair of  St.  Peter  for  one  year,  that  of  the  Consuls Severus  and  Quintilian  (A.D.  235).  He  was  put to  death  by  the  tyrant  Maximus  for  refusing  to deliver  up  a  volume  in  which  he  had  registered the  "Acts  of  the  Martyrs,"  and  was  buried in  the  catacombs  of  St.  Callistus  (a.d  236).

ANTHIMUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (April  27)  
(4th cent.)  Martyred at Nicomedia, the Imperial  residence  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  303).  His  death  was  followed  by  a  wholesale  slaughter of  the  clergy  of  the  district  and  of  their  flocks.  

ANTHIMUS  (St.)  M.  (May  11)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  at  Rome,  who  is  said to  have  converted  the  Pagan  husband  of  the Christian  matron  Lucina,  well  known  for  her charity  to  her  imprisoned  fellow-Christians. St.  Anthimus,  thrown  into  the  Tiber  but miraculously  rescued  by  an  angel,  was  afterwards retaken  and  beheaded  (a.d.  303).

ANTHOLIAN  (ANATOLIANUS)  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  6) (3rd  cent.)  St.  Gregory  of  Toms  numbers St.  Antholian  among  the  Martyrs  of  Auvergne, at  the  time  of  the  raid  into  Gaul  of  the  German chieftain  Chrocas,  which  occurred  while  the Emperors  Valerian  and  Gallienus  were  also persecuting  the  Christians,  some  time  before a.d.  267.  Among  his  fellow-sufferers  we  have the  names  of  SS.  Cassius.  Maximus,  Limininus and  Victorinus. But  particulars  are  wanting.

ANTHUSA  (St.)  V.  (July  27)  
(8th  cent.)  Various  versions  are  given  of the  life  of  this  Saint.  All  agree  that  she  was a  Greek  maiden  of  Constantinople,  distinguished by  her  zeal  for  the  Catholic  practice  of  the veneration  of  holy  pictures,  and  that  she thereby  incurred  the  indignation  of  the  Iconoclast Emperors  of  the  period.  It  also  seems certain  that  she  was  at  least  once  arrested and  put  to  the  torture.  But,  while  some  say that  she  died  in  exile,  others  have  it  that  she was  recalled  and  taken  into  favour  by  the Empress,  wife  of  Constantine  Copronymus, and  that  she  died  peacefully  at  Constantinople in  extreme  old  age.  There  is  further  a  tradition that  the  Empress  named  one  of  her  daughters after  this  holy  woman,  and  that  this  second Anthusa  also  became  a  Saint  and  was  venerated in  the  East  as  such.  No  reliable  dates  are available.  

ANTHUSA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  
See  SS.  ATHANASIl  S,  ANTHUSA, &c.  

ANTHUSA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  27)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Called  St.  Anthusa  the Younger,  to  distinguish  her  from  St.  Anthusa of  Seleucia  (Aug.  22).  She  was  probably  a Persian,  and  suffered  in  that  country.  She  is said  to  have  been  sewn  up  in  a  sack  and  drowned in  a  well.  

ANTIDIUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (June  25)  
(5th  cent.)  Otherwise  known  as  St.  Antel, St.  Tude, St. Antible. A disciple  and  the successor  of  St.  Froninus  in  the  See  of  Besancon (Eastern  France).  He  was  put  to  death  by  a horde  of  marauding  Arian  Vandals  at  a  place called  Ruffey,  where  his  relics  were  enshrined. But  there  are  serious  doubts  as  to  the  year and  even  the  century  in  which  he  suffered.

ANTIOCH  (MARTYRS  OF).  
The  Syrian  Church  was  fertile  in  Martyrs, both  in  the  earlier  persecutions  under  the heathen  Emperors,  and  in  those  set  in  foot  in the  fourth  and  fifth  centuries  by  the  heretics of  the  period.  It  had  also  its  Martyrs,  some centuries  later,  at  the  hands  of  the  Mohammedan Arabs.  Antioch,  the  See  of  the  Patriarchs of  the  East,  was  the  scene  of  many  of  these triumphs  of  Christian  heroes.  In  several  cases no  particular  Saint's  name  is  registered  in  connection with  them.  Of  these  we  collect  here  a few  instances  from  the  Roman  Martyrology.  

ANTIOCH  (MARTYRS  OF).  (March  11)  
(4th  cent.)  Numerous  Christians  who  suffered death  for  their  religion  in  Syria,  about  a.d.  300, under  the  Emperor  Maximian  Galerius,  colleague of  Diocletian.  

ANTIOCH  (MARTYRS  OF)  (Nov.  6)  
(7th  cent.)  Ten  Christians  put  to  death  by the  Arabs  after  their  seizure  of  Antioch  (a.d. 637).  Some  records  put  their  number  at  forty or  more.  In  such  cases  not  all  the  Christians massacred  are  reputed  as  Martyrs,  but  only those  previously  distinguished  for  holiness  of life,  and  those  who,  freedom  being  offered  to them  on  condition  of  renouncing  Christ,  have elected  to  die  for  Him.  

ANTIOCH  (MARTYRS  OF).  (Dec.  24)  
(3rd  cent.)  Forty  Christian  maidens  put  to death at Antioch, because of  their religion, under  the  Emperor  Decius  (a.d.  250).  

ANTIOCHUS  (St.)  M.  (May  21)  
See  SS.  NICOSTRATUS  and  ANTIOCHUS.  

ANTIOCHUS  and  CYRIACUS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  11)  
(3rd  cent.) Antiochus,  a  Christian  physician of  Sebaste  in  Armenia,  brother  of  the  Martyr, St.  Plato,  was  decapitated  for  his  religion  under a  governor  named  Hadrian,  towards  the  end of  the  third  century.  On  seeing  milk  in  place of  blood  miraculously  flowing  from  the  severed head  of  the  Martyr,  Cyriacus,  the  executioner, was  converted  to  Christianity,  and  forthwith made  to  share  the  fate  of  the  victim.  

ANTIOCHUS  (ANDEOL)  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  15)  
(5th  cent.)  When  St.  Justus,  Bishop  of Lyons,  had  renounced  his  Bishopric  in  order to  join  the  Solitaries  of  Upper  Egypt,  the priest  Andeol  was  sent  to  seek  him  out  and induce  him  to  return  to  his  sorrowing  flock. His  efforts,  however,  were  made  in  vain,  and  on his  return  to  Lyons  he  was  himself  chosen Bishop.  After  distinguishing  himself  by  his zeal  and  firmness,  he  fell  asleep  in  Christ  early in  the  fifth  century.  

ANTIOCHUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  13)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Sardinian  Martyr,  by  profession a  physician,  who  suffered  under  the Emperor  Hadrian,  about  a.d.  110.  He  is  an object  of  popular  devotion  in  Sardinia,  where the  place  of  his  martyrdom  is  called  the  Isola di  Sant'  Antioco.  There  are  details  of  his Passion  in  one  of  the  codices  preserved  in  the Vatican.  His  name  appears  in  the  Litany  of Saints  of  the  medical  profession,  compiled  by William  du  Val,  Archdeacon  of  Paris.  

ANTIPAS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (April  11)  
(1st  cent.)  He  is  venerated  as  the  first  Bishop of  Pergamus  (Asia  Minor),  and  is  by  St.  John in  the  Apocalypse  (ii.  13)  styled  the  "  Faithful witness."  Tradition  avers  that  he  was  roasted to  death  in  a  brazen  ox  in  the  reign  of  the Emperor  Domitian  (a.d.  81-a.d.  96).  

ANTOINETTE  (St.).

See  SS.  AGAPIUS,  SECUNDINUS, &c.  

ANTONIA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  4)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  of  Byzantium (Constantinople),  who  after  torture  was burned  at  the  stake  in  one  of  the  closing  years of  the  third  century,  during  the  persecution  of the  Emperors  Diocletian  and  Galerius.  

ANTONINA  (St.)  V.M.  (March  1)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  pious  woman,  who,  in  the persecution  at  the  close  of  the  third  century, was  shut  up  in  a  cask  and  thrown  into  a  marsh near  the  town  of  Cea  (Beira,  Portugal).  Cea is  said  by  some  to  be  a  copyist's  mistake  for Nicaea  in  Bithynia.  

ANTONINA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  3)  
(4th cent.)  A Christian maiden who was delivered  from  a  house  of  infamy  by  a  soldier, St.  Alexander.  They  suffered  martyrdom together  (a.d.  312)  at  Constantinople.  

ANTONINA  (St.)  M.  (June  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Martyr  of  Nicaea  in  Bithynia during  the  persecution  of  Diocletian.  By  order of  the  governor,  Priscillian,  she  was  scourged, placed  on  the  rack,  torn  with  iron  hooks  and finally  beheaded  (a.d.  290).  She  is  perhaps one  and  the  same  with  the  St.  Antonina  of March  1.  

ANTONINUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  13)  
(9th  cent.)  An  Abbot  of  the  monastery  of St.  Agrippinus  at  Sorrento  (Naples),  where  a church  was  built  in  his  honour.  He  is  a  Patron Saint  of  Sorrento,  and  his  Feast  is  kept  there on  the  anniversary  of  his  burial,  Feb.  13,  a.d. 830.

ANTONINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  10)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Florentine,  born  a.d.  1389, who,  embracing  the  Religious  life  in  the  Dominican Order,  and  successively  governed  many convents,  until  he  was  raised  to  the  Archbishopric of  Florence  (a.d.  1446).  He  died three  years  later,  and  was  buried  in  the  church of  his*  Order  in  Florence.  His  learning  and intellectual  grasp,  conspicuous  in  his  many erudite  works  on  Divinity  and  Canon  Law, together  with  his  Apostolic  virtues,  gained  for him  the  respect  and  esteem  of  his  contemporaries. He  enjoyed  the  confidence  of  the  Popes of  his  time.  Pope  Eugene  IV,  when  dying, sent  for  him  to  administer  to  him  the  last  Rites, and  Pius  II  was  present  in  Florence  at  the Saint's  funeral.

ANTONINUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  
(2nd  cent.)  One  of  the  public  executioners in  Rome  under  the  Emperor  Commodus. While  awaiting  the  result  of  the  trial  of  SS. Eusebius  and  other  Christians  (a.d.  186),  he saw  a  vision  of  Angels  and,  proclaiming  himself a  Christian,  was  himself  beheaded,  winning first  of  all  that  company,  the  Martvr's  crown.  

ANTONINUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  2)  
(2nd  cent.)  This  holy  Martyr  is  sometimes confused  with  St.  Antoninus  of  Apamea  in  Syria, so  much  so  that  even  the  Bollandists  offer  no solution  to  the  doubt.  His  cultus  at  Apamea (Pamiers,  Languedoc)  in  France,  and  at  Palentia in  Spain,  is  undoubted.  Local  tradition  in France  places  his  martyrdom  at  Fredelas, afterwards  called  Pamiers,  which  is  also  said to  have  been  his  birthplace  in  the  second  half of  the  first  century.  He  is  supposed  to  have been  of  Royal  blood,  to  have  lived  for  a  time  in solitude,  to  have  visited  Rome,  and  to  have been there ordained priest.  After preaching in  Italy  and  working  many  miracles,  he  is alleged  to  have  returned  to  Prance,  and  laboured in  the  district  of  Noble-Val  (now  called  S. Antonin)  and  also  in  Toulouse.  After  undergoing torture  he  was  beheaded.  The  date  is too  uncertain  for  reasonable  conjecture.

(3rd  cent.)  A  soldier  of  the  Theban  Legion and  a  comrade  of  St.  Maurice.  He  was  martyred on  the  banks  of  the  Trebbia  near  Piacenza,  late in  the  third  century.  A  church  was  founded in  his  honour  in  the  year  324,  restored  in  903, and  rebuilt  in  1104.  His  blood,  which  is preserved  in  a  phial,  and  exposed  to  public veneration  on  his  Feast  day,  is  said  to  have  the same  miraculous  properties  as  that  of  St. Januarius  at  Naples.  

ANTONINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  31)  
(7th  cent.)  During  his  one  year  of  Episcopate (A.D.  660)  St.  Antoninus  Pontana,  Archbishop of  Milan,  gave  such  convincing  proofs  of  being rich  in  all  pastoral  virtues  that  even  during  his lifetime  his  flock  proclaimed  him  a  Saint.  He was  interred  in  the  Church  of  St.  Simplician, where  the  Milanese  Bishop3  were  as  a  ride buried.  In  the  year  1581,  St.  Charles  Borromeo after  careful  investigation,  removed  his  relics, enshrining  them  under  a  magnificent  altar  which he  had  caused  to  be  constructed  in  the  same church.  

ANTONINUS, ZEBINA. GERMANUS and ENNATHA  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  12)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  under  Galerius,  the colleague  of  Diocletian,  at  Caesarea  in  Palestine (a.d.  297).  St.  Ennatha,  a  Christian  virgin, after  being  severely  scourged,  was  burned  alive. Her  male  fellow-sufferers,  who  boldly  reproached Firmilian,  the  pagan  judge,  for  his  cruelty  to a  woman,  were  beheaded.  

ANTONY  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  9)  
See  SS.  JULIAN,  BASILISSA, &c.  

ANTONY  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  17)  
(4th  cent.)  The  "  Patriarch  "  of  the  monastic life,  as  was  his  contemporary,  St.  Paul, the  first  hermit,  of  the  eremitical.  Born  at Coma,  near  Heraclea  in  Upper  Egypt  (a.d.  251), he,  after  the  decease  of  his  parents,  well-to-do Egyptians,  retired  into  the  solitudes  of  the neighbouring  desert,  where  by  dint  of  prayer and  penance  he  overcame  the  most  terrible temptations.  Numerous  disciples  soon  flocked to  him,  and  (A.D.  305)  he  founded  his  first  monastery in  the  Thebais.  The  awful  persecution of  Christianity  at  the  close  of  the  third  century, by  driving  countless  men  and  women  as  fugitives into  the  wilds  surrounding  the  valley  of  the Nile,  no  doubt  quickened  the  impulse  felt  by many  in  all  ages  to  separate  themselves  permanently from  the  world.  St.  Antony's  wise government  of  his  monks,  coupled  with  his supernatural  gifts,  spread  his  fame  both  in  the East  and  in  the  West  and  enabled  him  to contribute  efficaciously  to  the  victory  of  the Catholics  over  the  Arians  at  the  Council  of Nicaea  in  A.D.  325.  St.  Antony  died,  A.D.  356, at  the  age  of  one  hundred  and  five.  From  the submissiveness  of  animals  to  him,  he  is  regarded as  the  Patron  Saint  of  herdsmen.  His  life, written  by  St.  Athanasius,  is  a  religious  classic. 

ANTONY,  MERULUS  and  JOHN  (SS.)  (Jan.  17)  
(6th  cent.)  Three  holy  monks,  disciples  of St.  Gregory  the  Great,  in  his  monastery  of St.  Andrew  (now  San  Gregorlo)  in  Rome,  at  the close  of  the  sixth  century.  The  great  Pope writes  at  length  of  their  wonderful  sanctity and  of  the  miracles  by  which  Almighty  God bore  witness  to  it.  

♦ANTONA,  JOHN  and  EUSTACHIUS  (April  14)  
(SS.)  MM.  
(14th  cent.)  Officials  at  the  Court  of  the Grand  Duke  of  Lithuania  who  with  his  subjects was still heathen, converted  to Christianity.  The  tliree  Saints  were  on  that  account  put  to the  torture  and  afterwards  hanged  at  Wilna, about  a.d.  1342.  They  are  venerated  as Patron  Saints  of  the  city  of  Vilna.  

ANTONY,  CAULEAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  11)  
(9th  cent.)  A  native  of  Phrygia  who  entered a  monastery  of  which  he  became  Abbot,  and who  was  elected  (A.D.  893)  Patriarch  of  Constantinople. He  presided  over  a  Council  which condemned  and  reformed  the  Acts  of  Photius, originator  of  the  Greek  Schism.  The  Patriarch Antony  died  in  his  sixty-seventh  year,  a.d.  896.

ANTONY  OF  PADUA  (St.)  (June  13)  
(13th  cent.)  A  native  of  Lisbon,  who received  the  name  of  Ferdinand  at  Baptism (A.D.  1195).  He  joined  the  Order  of  Canons Regulars  at  an  early  age,  but  soon  exchanged  it for  that  of  the  Franciscans  (A.D.  1221).  He received  the  religious  habit  in  the  convent  of St.  Antony  at  Coimbra  and  assumed  the  name of  Antony  in  honour  of  the  great  Hermit  Saint of  Egypt.  His  desire  for  martyrdom  took  him to  Africa,  but  illness  and  storm  brought  him  to Italy,  where  under  the  guidance  of  St.  Franci3, he  began  his  wonderful  career  as  a  preacher and  worker  of  miracles.  He  died  at  Padua, A.D.  1231,  and  was  canonised  by  Pope  Gregory IX  in  the  following  year.  In  art  he  is  represented in  various  ways,  but  mostly  bearing  the Child  Jesus  in  his  arms.  

ANTONY,  MARY  ZACCARIA  (St.)  (July  5)  
(16th  cent.)  Born  at  Cremona  (Lombardy), he  was  remarkable  from  his  early  youth  for  his ability  and  yet  more  for  his  piety  and  zeal  for the  spiritual  and  temporal  good  of  his  neighbour, particularly  of  the  poor.  He  laboured  all  his life  long  for  the  restoring  of  Church  Discipline, and  with  that  intent  founded  the  Religious Order  styled  Barnabites,  under  the  patronage of  St.  Paul  the  Apostle.  Favoured  with  many supernatural  gifts  and  graces,  he  passed  away, a.d.  1539,  and  wa3  canonised  by  Pope  Leo  XIII at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  centurv.

ANTONY  (St.)  (Dec.  28)  
(6th  cent.)  By  birth  a  Hungarian,  who, after  serving  God  for  many  years  as  a  hermit of  the  Alps,  passed  the  last  two  years  of  a  holy life  in  the  monastery  of  the  Isle  of  Lerins,  off the  southern  coast  of  France,  where  his  relics were  enshrined.  Renowned  for  the  working of  miracles,  he  passed  away  about  the  year  526. St.  Ennodius,  Bishop  of  Pavia,  wrote  a  Life  of St.  Antony,  to  be  found  in  Surius.  

ANYSIA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  30)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  woman  who,  by order  of  Dulcitius,  Governor  of  Thessalonica, was  arrested  on  her  entering  that  city  to  attend the  assembly  of  the  Faithful,  and  put  to  death (30th  Dec.  A.D.  304),  in  the  reign  of  the  persecuting Emperor  Maximian  Galerius,  Diocletian's colleague.  

ANYSIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  30)  
(5th  cent.)  The  successor  (a.d.  383)  of  the holy  Bishop  Ascolus  in  the  See  of  Thessalonica in  Macedonia.  He  was  a  friend  of  St.  Ambrose, who  wrote  to  the  clergy  and  people  of  Thessalonica,  congratulating  them  on  their  choice, and  also  to  St.  Anysius,  exhorting  him  to  follow in  the  footsteps  of  the  Saint,  his  predecessor. Pope  St.  Damasus  showed  his  confidence  in St.  Anysius  by  appointing  him  his  Vicar  Apostolic in  Ulyria.  Anysius  also  was  one  among the  forty  Bishops  who  bravely  stood  by  St. John  Clirysostom  against  Theophilus  of  Alexandria. He  died  at  an  advanced  age  about  the year  403.  

AOUT  (St.)  Conf.  (Oct.  7)  
Otherwise  St.  AUGUSTUS,  which  see. APELLES  and  LUCIUS  (SS.)  Bps.,  MM.  (April  22) (1st  cent.)  Disciples  ot  Our  Lord,  probably of  the  seventy-two  chosen  by  Him  as  missionaries. Traditionally,  St.  Apelles  is  held  to  have been  Bishop  of  Smyrna,  and  St.  Lucius  Bishop of  Laodicea.  Both  are  mentioned  by  St.  Paul in  his  Epistle  to  the  Romans  (xvi.  10,  21).  

APELLIUS,  LUCIUS  and  CLEMENT (Sept.  10) (SS.)  MM.  
(1st  cent.)  There  can  be  little  doubt  that SS.  Apellius  and  Lucius  are  identical  with  the SS.  Apelles  and  Lucius  commemorated  on April  22.  The  St.  Clement  who  is  added  will have  been  another  of  the  seventy-two  disciples mentioned  in  the  Gospel  as  having  been  sent as  missionaries  by  Christ  Himself.  By  various writers  this  St.  Clement  is  said  to  have  been Bishop  of  Sardis.  

APHRAATES  (St.)  Conf.  (April  7)  
(4th  cent.)  An  anchoret  of  Persian  birth who  settled  at  Edessa  in  Mesopotamia.  Later on  he  removed  to  Antioch,  where  he  strengthened the  Faith  of  the  Catholics  by  his  sermons and  miracles,  during  the  Arian  persecution, under  the  Emperor  Valens.

See  SS.  PETER  and  APHRODISIUS.  

APHRODISIUS, CARALIPPUS, AGAPITUS and EUSEBIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  28)  
(1st  cent.)  According  to  the  Martyrology of  the  Saints  of  France,  St.  Aphrodisius  sheltered the  Holy  Family  during  their  flight  into Egypt,  and  after  the  Ascension  joined  the disciples,  attaching  himself  to  St.  Peter.  Later he  travelled  with  St.  Paul  and  finally  became the  Apostle  of  Languedoc  (France),  where  he was  put  to  death  for  the  Faith  with  the  three of  his  followers  named  above.  There  is,  however, an  opinion  that  this  holy  Bishop,  though undoubtedly  one  of  the  Apostles  of  Gaul,  lived one  or  two  centuries  later.  

APHRODISIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  30)  
(Date  unknown.)  An  Egyptian  priest  put to  death  for  the  Faith  at  Alexandria  with  about thirty  of  his  flock.

(5th  cent.)  A  daughter  of  the  Consul  Arthenius,  who  governed  the  Empire  during  the minority  of  Theodosius  the  Younger.  After spending  several  years  as  a  solitary,  the  Saint took  the  name  of  Dorotheus  and  placed  herself under  the  guidance  of  St.  Macarius  of  Alexandria. Of  this  holy  virgin  a  legend  asserts  that she  obtained  the  use  of  a  hermitage  from  the Solitaries  by  disguising  herself  in  man's  attire. She  died  about  A.D.  450.  

APOLLINARIS  (St.;  Bp.  (Jan.  8)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Hierapolis  in  Phrygia,  and  one  of  the  great  lights  of  the  Early Church.  He  refuted  the  doctrines  of  Cliristian Stoicism  promulgated  by  Tatian,  and  exposed the  hypocrisy  of  the  heretic  Montanus.  In the  year  177  he  delivered  Ins  famous  Apology for  the  Christians  to  Marcus  Aurelius,  the philosophic  Emperor.  He  died  about  A.D.  180. He  is  also  called  Claudius  Apollinaris.

See  SS.  CYRIACUS  and  APOLLINARIS.  

APOLLINARIS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (July  23)  
(1st  cent.)  Said  to  have  come  from  Antioch with  St.  Peter,  and  to  have  been  appointed by  him  as  the  first  Bishop  of  Ravenna.  His life  was  one  of  continuous  suffering  at  the hands  of  persecutors,  but  it  was  preserved through  a  wnole  series  of  savage  and  deadly torture.  Ho  was  thrice  banished  from  Ravenna, and  during  his  exile  preached  the  Gospel  in Asia  Minor,  on  the  banks  of  the  Danube,  and in  Thrace  on  the  south  side  of  the  same  river. He  died  from  the  effects  of  torture  and  fatigue in  the  reign  of  Vespasian  (A.D.  79).  St.  Peter Damian  says  that  Apollinaris  sacrificed  himself as  a  living  victim  for  the  true  Faith  by  the continual  martyrdom  which  he  endured  for  the space  of  twenty-nine  consecutive  years.  He was  buried  at  Classe,  near  Ravenna.  

APOLLINARIS  (St.)  M.  (4ug.  23)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  gaoler  at  Rheims  (France), who,  on  witnessing  the  constancy  of  St.  Timothy and  the  heavenly  visions  with  which  he  was comforted,  threw  himself  at  his  feet  and  begged to  be  made  a  Christian.  They  were  both beheaded  by  the  Governor  Lampadus,  who  is said  to  have  been  in  punishment  struck  by lightning,  obsessed  by  a  devil,  and  in  the  end suffocated  by  the  Evil  One.  Many  churches were  erected  in  honour  of  St.  Apollinaris.  and many  miracles  wrought  at  the  tomb  at  Rheims of  the  Martyr  and  his  fellow-sufferer.  Some assert  that  St.  Apollinaris  is  a  Saint  of  the first  century,  but  it  is  now  commonly  admitted that  he  is  to  be  dated  two  hundred  years  later.  

APOLLINARIS  SIDONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  23)  
See  St.  SIDONIUS.  

APOLLINARIS  (AIPLOMAY)  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  5) (6th  cent.)  One  of  the  family  of  Saints  of which  both  his  father  St.  Isicus  and  his  brother St.  Avitus  became  successively  Bishops  of Vienne  (France).  The  See  of  Valence  had been  vacant  for  many  years  when  St.  Apollinaris was  appointed  to  it  by  the  Bishops  of  the Province  (A.D.  486).  His  zeal  in  the  extirpation of  many  abuses  which  had  arisen  during  the vacancy  was  indefatigable,  in  spite  of  many serious  maladies  from  which  he  miraculously recovered.  He  was  exiled  by  King  Sigismund for  taking  part  in  the  sentence  ,of  excommunication issued  against  Stephen,  the  Royal  Treasurer, by  the  Council  of  Lyons,  but  was  restored  to  his See  on  miraculously  curing  Sigismund  of  a mortal  malady.  He  died  about  a.d.  520. His  body  was  interred  in  the  Cathedral  of Va  ence,  which,  owing  to  the  frequent  miracles wrought  through  his  intercession,  assumed  the title  of  St.  Apollinaris.  His  relics  were  cast into  the  Rhone  by  the  Huguenots  in  the  sixteenth century.  

♦APOLLO  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  25)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  Egyptian  Fathers  of the Desert.  He governed a community of five  hundred  monks,  near  Heliopolis,  and  died about  A.D.  393,  being  then  over  eighty  years  old.  

APOLLO,  ISAACIUS  and  CROTATES (April  21) (SS.)  MM.  
(4th  cent.)  These  Saints  are  said  to  have been  attendants  in  the  Palace  of  the  Empress Alexandra,  wife  of  Diocletian.  In  the  persecution Crotates  (Codratus)  was  beheaded,  and  the others  left  to  die  of  hunger  in  prison  (a.d.  302).  

APOLLONIA  (APOLLINE)  (St.)  V.M.  (Feb.  9)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  venerable  Christian  woman  of Alexandria,  who  was  burned  to  death  after suffering  many  tortures.  Her  teeth  were broken  with  pincers,  and  for  this  reason  she  is invoked  against  toothache  and  Is  represented holding  a  tooth  in  pincers.  Condemned  to  die at  the  stake,  she  is  said  to  have  leapt  of  her own  accord  into  the  flames  (A.D.  249).

APOLLONIUS  and  LEONTIUS (LEONTINUS)  
(SS.)  Bps.,  MM.  (March  19)  
(4th cent.)  There  is  a  great difference  of opinion  about  the  Sees  and  places  of  martyrdom of  these  two  Bishops. The  most  likely  solution is  that  Apollonius  succeeded  Leontius  in  the See  of  Braga  in  Portugal.  No  particulars  of their  lives  and  alleged  martyrdom  are  extant.  

APOLLONIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  19)  
(4th  cent.) A  priest  of  Alexandria,  who  was thrown  into  the  sea  with  five  other  Christians during  the  persecution under Diocletian  and his  colleagues.  All  particulars  are  lost.  

APOLLONIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  18)  
(2nd  cent.) A  Roman  Senator  who,  accused of  being  a  Cliristian  by  one  of  his  slaves,  was condemned  to  be  beheaded  (a.d.  186).  He  is called  Apollonius  the  Apologist,  on  account  of his  eloquent  speech  before  the  Senate,  in  defence of  the  Faith.  St.  Jerome  and  Eusebius  refer to  this  speech  as  one  full  of  eloquence  and  of sacred  and  profane  learning.

(2nd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Brescia  in  Lombardy, mentioned  in  the  Acts  of  SS.  Faustinus  and Jo  vita,  as  having  ordained  the  former,  priest, and  the  latter,  deacon.  He  is  said  to  have nourished  from  about  the  year  112  to  140. But  in  the  Analecta  Bollandiana,  both  the period  of  the  Episcopate  of  St.  Apollonius  and the  Acts  of  SS.  Faustinus  and  Jo  vita  are  called in  question.  However  this  may  be,  St.  Apollonius was  buried  in  the  church  of  St.  Andrew at  Brescia,  and  his  relics  are  preserved  there in  the  Cathedral  of  the  Assumption.  

APOLLONIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  10)  
(4th  cent.)  The  Menology  of  Basil  tells  us that  he  was  a  native  of  Sardis  in  Lydia  (Asia Minor),  and  that  by  his  real  and  preaching  he converted  many  Pagans  to  Christianity.  He was  summoned  before  the  Prefect  Perinius  at Iconium,  scourged  and  crucified,  early  in  the fourth  century. APOLLONIUS  and  EUGENE  (SS.)  MM.  (July  23) (Date  unknown.)  Roman  Martyrs  of  whom little  is  known  except  that  in  the  metrical Calendar  of  Dijon  St.  Apollonius  is  mentioned as  having  suffered  at  the  stake.  He  was  not burned,  but  shot  at  and  pierced  with  arrows. St.  Eugene  is  described  as  having  courageously, after  being  sentenced  to  death  as  a  Christian, of  his  own  accord  offered  his  neck  to  the  axe of  the  executioner.

(5th  cent.)  Sister  of  St.  Anerius,  Bishop  of Toul,  in  which  Diocese  she  lived  a  saintly  life, and  is  honoured  with  a  liturgical  cultus.  

APRONIAN  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  official  who  was  converted to  Christianity  when  conducting  the Martyr  St.  Sisinus  before  the  Prefect  Laudieius, and  was  himself  thereupon  also  put  to  death for  the  Faith  about  A.D.  303.  

APRUS  (APER,  APRE,  EPVRE,  EVRE)  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  15)  
(6th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  born  in  the Diocese  of  Troyes.  He  began  life  as  a  lawyer, and  in  the  practice  of  his  profession  acquired great  fame  on  account  both  of  his  forensic ability  and  of  his  scrupulous  integrity.  After some  years  he  abandoned  the  legal  profession in  order  to  enter  into  the  Ecclesiastical  state, and  in  time  was  chosen  as  their  Bishop  by  the 28 clergy  and  people  of  Toul.  After  a  long Episcopate,  during  which  he  endeared  himself to  his  flock  as  well  by  his  gentleness  in  ruling as  by  the  vivid  example  he  gave  in  his  own life  of  what  he  inculcated  in  preaching,  he passed  away  (a.d.  507)  at  an  advanced  age, and  was  buried  in  the  Basilica,  which  he  was then  busy  in  constructing.  His  Life,  written soon  after  his  decease,  recounts  many  miracles wrought  at  his  tomb.  By  many  the  tradition that  he  had  been  a  lawyor  before  he  was  a priest  is  rejected,  and  attributed  to  his  having been  confused  with  another  holy  man  of  the same  name  who  flourished  half  a  century before  him.  

APULEIUS  and  MARCELLUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  7)  
(1st  cent.)  According  to  the  Roman  Martyrology,  St.  Apuleius  and  his  fellow-martyr (by  some  said  to  have  been  his  own  brother), Marcellus,  were  at  one  time  followers  of  Simon Magus,  but  were  converted  at  sight  of  the miracles  wrought  by  the  Apostle  St.  Peter. They  gained  the  crown  of  martyrdom  under a  judge  by  name  Aurelian,  and  were  buried without  the  walls  of  Rome.  There  is  a  tradition that  it  was  they  who  interred  the  body  of St.  Peter  on  the  Vatican  Hill  after  his  crucifixion, which  they  carried  out  "  after  the manner  of  the  Jews,"  in  order  that  in  his tomb  as  in  his  death,  the  Apostle  might  be  like to  his  Divine  Master.  SS.  Apuleius  and Marcellus  are  commemorated  in  all  the  ancient Martyrologies  and  in  many  Liturgies.

AQUILA  (St.)  (March  23)  
See  SS.  DOMITIUS,  PELAGIA, &c.  

AQUILA  (St.)  M.  (May  20)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Christian,  torn  to pieces  with  iron  combs  (a.d.  31 1),  in  the  persecution under  the  Emperor  Maximinus  Daza,  by order  of  Arianus,  Governor  of  Thebes,  who subsequently  himself  became  a  Christian  and suffered  martyrdom  in  the  same  persecution.  

AQUILA  and  PRISCILLA  (SS.)  (July  8)  
(1st  cent.)  A  husband  and  wife,  natives of  Pontus,  a  province  of  Asia  Minor  bordering on  the  Black  Sea.  They  were  tentmakers  in Rome  during  the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Claudius and  with  other  Jews  were  thence  banished. On  their  return  journey  to  Asia  they  halted at  Corinth,  and  there  met  St.  Paul  coming from  Athens  (Acts  xviii.  3),  and  received  him into  their  house.  He  was  again  their  guest  at Ephesus,  leaving  which  city  at  about  the  same time  as  the  Apostle,  they  returned  to  Rome  in the  fourth  year  of  the  reign  of  Nero.  In  his Epistle  to  the  Romans  St.  Paul  sends  his greeting  to  Aquila  and  Priscilla  (Rom.  xvi. 3,  4,  5  ;  see  also  1  Cor.  xvi.  19).  They  are commonly  believed  to  have  returned  again  to Asia  Minor,  but  there  is  also  a  tradition  that they  suffered  martyrdom  in  Rome  as  Christians.

See  SS.  CYRIL,  AQUILA, &c.  

AQUILINA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  girl,  not  more  than twelve  years  old,  who  was  tortured  and  beheaded at  Byblos  in  Phoenicia  (A.D.  293)  in  a  first  phase of  the  persecution  under  Diocletian,  before  that Emperor  had  openly  declared  his  mind  to uproot  the  Christian  religion.  

AQUILINA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  24)  
(3rd  cent.)  This  Saint,  with  her  sister,  St. Niceta,  is  commemorated  in  connection  with the  Martyr  St.  Christopher,  in  whose  Acts  they are  mentioned.  Converted  by  him  to  Christianity, they  are  said  to  have  shared  the  glory of  his  martyrdom  in  one  of  the  persecutions  of the  third  centurv.  

AQUILINUS, GEMINUS, EUGENIUS, MARCIANUS,  QUINCTUS,  THEODOTUS  &  TRYPHON (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  4)  
(5th  cent.)  A  band  of  Martyrs  put  to  death in  Africa  by  the  Arian  Hunneric,  King  of  the Vandals,  about  A. P.  484.  Their  Acts,  now  lost, seem  to  have  been  in  the  hands  of  the  Venerable Bede  in  the  eighth  century.  

AQUILINUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  29)  
(7th  cent.)  A  priest  who  was  put  to  death near  Milan  by  the  Arians.  A  Bavarian  by  birth, he  had  refused  more  than  one  Bishopric  out  of desire  to  serve  God  in  a  more  lowly  capacity. He  was  a  successful  preacher,  and,  his  zeal against  the  dangerous  heresy  of  Arianism  having drawn  him  to  preach  in  Lombardy,  his  enemies sought  and  found  an  opportunity  to  have  him assassinated,  about a.d. 650.  His relics are 

AQUILINUS, GEMINUS, GELASIUS, MAGNUS and  DONATUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  4)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  at Fossombrone  in Central  Italy  at  the  close  of  the  third  century.  No  particulars  are  now  discoverable.  

AQUILINUS  and  VICTORIAN  (SS.)  MM. (May  16)  
(Date  unknown.) Martyrs  in  the  Province  of Isauria  (Asia  Minor),  and  as  such  registered  in the  Martyrology  of  Venerable  Bede.  But  we have  neither  date  nor  other  particulars.  

AQUILINUS  (St.)  M.  (May  17)  
See  SS.  HEBADIUS,  PAUL, &c.  

AQUILINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  19)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Prankish  nobleman  who fought  under  King  Clovis  II  against  the Visigoths.  On  his  return  from  this  war  he and  his  wife  agreed  to  separate  and  to  devote themselves  to  the  care  of  the  sick,  upon  whom they  proposed  to  expend  all  their  wealth.  On the  death  of  St.  JStherius,  Aquilinus  was chosen  Bishop  of  Evreux  and  governed  that Diocese  with  great  zeal  for  forty-two  years. He  assisted  at  the  Council  of  Rouen  under St.  Ansbert,  and  died  about  the  year  690, having  for  a  year  or  two  previously  been afflicted  M'ith  blindness.  

ARABIA  (MARTYRS  OF).  (Feb.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  In  Arabia,  as  in  other  countries, very  many  Christians  suffered  death  for  their religion  at  the  close  of  the  third  and  beginning of  the  fourth  century.  Their  number,  much less  their  names,  do  not  seem  to  have  been entered  in  any  authentic  register.  They  are, however,  commemorated  liturgically  on  February 23rd,  and  have  been  so  honoured  from ancient  times.  By  the  term  Arabia  is  here understood,  conformably  to  the  usage  of  the period,  the  countries,  mainly  desert,  east  of the  Jordan,  and,  again,  the  mountainous  districts south  of  the  Dead  Sea.  

ARABIA  (St.)  M.  (March  13)  
See  SS.  THEUSITA,  HORRES, &c.  

ARATUS,  FORTUNATUS,  FELIX,  SILVIUS  and VITALIS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  21)  
(Date  unknown.)  St.  Arator  was  a  priest of  Alexandria  in  Egypt,  put  to  death  with  the other  Christians  named  above,  in  one  of  the earlier  persecutions.  No  particulars  are  now extant.  

ARBOGASTES  (St.)  Bp.  (July  21)  
(7th  cent.)  Though  claimed  as  their  compatriot both  by  the  Irish  and  by  the  Scotch, he  is  described  in  his  Life  as  a  noble  of  Aquitaine, who,  taking  to  the  life  of  a  hermit,  passed  several years  in  a  solitary  cave  in  Alsace.  In  A. P.  660, King  Dagobert  II  insisted  on  his  accepting the  Bishopric  of  Strasbourg.  St.  Arbogastus was  remarkable  as  a  Bishop,  and  the  object even  in  life  of  intense  popular  veneration. Among  the  many  miracles  related  as  wroueht by  him  is  the  raising  again  to  life  of  one  "of the  King's  sons,  who  had  been  accidentally killed  while  hunting.  The  Saint  died  in  the year  678,  and  was  at  his  own  request  at  first interred  in  the  place  set  apart  for  the  burial of  criminals.  A  church  was  soon  built  over  his tomb.  In  art,  St.  Arbogastus  is  usually  represented as  walking  dry-shod  over  a  river.  

ARCADIUS  (St.)  M.  (.Ian.  12)  
(4th  cent.)  A  prominent  citizen  of  Caesarea 
in  Mauritania  (near  Algiers),  who,  after  having been savagely mutilated, was put to death in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian,  or  rather under his colleague Maximianus Herculeus, about  A.D.  302.  

ARCADIUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (March  4)  
See  SS.  BASIL,  EUGENIUS, &c.  

ARCADIUS,  PASCHASIUS,  PROBUS,  EUTYCHIAN  and  PAULILLUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  13)  
(5th  cent.)  Spaniards  who  suffered  death for  the  Catholic  Faith  in  Africa,  whither  they had  been  deported  by  the  Arian  Genseric, King  of  the  Vandals.  Paulillus,  a  child, younger  brother  of  SS.  Paschasius  and  Eutychian,  though  not  put  to  death,  but  only scourged  and  sold  into  slavery,  is  reckoned like  the  others  among  the  Martyrs.  These Saints  are  regarded  as  the  Proto-Martyrs  of  the Vandal  persecution.  Hence  Honoratus,  Bishop of  Constantine,  in  a  letter  to  Arcadius,  addresses him  by  the  title  of  "  Standard-Bearer  of  the Faith."  The  year  437  is  given  as  the  date  of their  martyrdom.  

♦ARCHELAA  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  VV.MM.  (Jan.  18)  
(3rd  cent.)  Three  Christian  maidens  put to  the  torture  and  afterwards  beheaded  at Nola  in  the  south  of  Italy  (a.d.  285),  at  the very  beginning  of  the  reign  of  Diocletian,  and, it  would  appear,  without  his  express  sanction, but  in  virtue  of  the  persecuting  edicts  of  former Emperors.  

ARCHELAUS, CYRILLUS and PHOTIUS (SS.)  MM.  (March  4)  
(Date  unknown.)  Nothing  is  known  of  these Saints  beyond  the  fact  of  the  insertion  of  their names  in  the  Roman  and  other  Martyrologies.  

ARCHELAUS, QUIRICUS and MAXIMUS (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  23)  
(3rd  cent.)  Archelaus  was  a  deacon  ;  Maximus,  a  priest ;  and  Quiricus,  or  Quiriacus,  a Bishop.  They  suffered  death  for  their  Faith in  Christ,  at  Ostia,  at  the  mouth  of  the  Tiber, in  one  of  the  persecutions,  about  the  middle  of the  third  century.  Their  names  appear  in  all the  ancient  Martyrologies.  They  seem  to  have been  scourged  and  beheaded  without  any  of  the horrible  and  exquisite  tortures  to  which  Christians were  often  subjected,  even  in  defiance of  the  Imperial  Law  ordering  simple  decapitation. With  St.  Archelaus  and  the  two  mentioned above,  there  were  also  a  certain  number of  laymen  who  suffered  with  them.  

ARCHELAUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  26)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Cascus  (Charchar) in  Mesopotamia,  well  known  for  his  pastoral zeal  and  for  his  talents  and  eloquence.  A  widely propagated  story  has  it  that,  about  A.D.  250, St.  Archelaus  held  a  public  dispute  with the  heretic  Manes,  author  of  Manicheeism. He  utterly  discomfited  his  adversary ;  but the  dispute  was  afterwards  renewed,  always with  the  same  result.  St.  Archelaus  has  left valuable  writings  on  the  controversy  with  the Manichees  ;  and  St.  Jerome  on  that  account numbers  him  among  prominent  Ecclesiastical writers.  St.  Archelaus  died  about  a.d.  280.  

ARCHIPPUS  (St.)  (March  20)  
(1st  cent.)  A  fellow-worker  with  St.  Paul, who  mentions  him  by  name  in  two  of  his Epistles  (Philem.  2;  Col.  iv.  17).  Greek tradition  places  him  among  Christ's  seventytwo  disciples.  Again,  it  was  an  opinion  popular in  early  and  mediaeval  times  that  he  was  the first  Bishop  of  the  Colossians.  

ARCONTIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  5)  
See  SS.  QUINCTIUS,  ARCONTIUS, &c.  

ARDALION  (St.)  M.  (April  14)  
(4th  cent.)  An  actor  whose  mimicry  of  the Christian  Mysteries  was  very  popular  with Pagan  audiences.  During  a  performance  in  a city  in  Asia  Minor,  he  suddenly  proclaimed himself  a  Cliristian  and  was  roasted  alive  in  the public  square  (A. P.  300).  

♦ARDWYNE  (St.)  Conf.  (July  28)  
(7th  cent.) He  with  his  fellow-countrymen from  England,  SS.  Gerard,  Fulk  and  Bernard, while  on  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome,  was  carried  off by  death  in  the  south  of  Italy.  The  date  is probably  some  time  in  the  seventh  century  ; but  even  the  most  scientific  research,  carried  out carefully  in  recent  times,  has  failed  to  elucidate the  story  of  these  Saints.  St.  Ardwyne  is  venerated as  Patron  Saint  of  the  town  of  Ceprano.  

AREGLOE  (St.)  Bp.  (March  17)  
Otherwise St. AGRICOLA, which  see. 

ARESIUS, ROGATUS and OTHERS (June  10)  (SS.)  MM.  
(Date  unknown.)  A  band  of  seventeen African  Martyrs,  particulars  concerning  whom have  been  lost.  Some  Martyrologies  class  them with  the  Roman  Martyrs,  Basilides  and  others, commemorated  on  the  same  day.  

ARETHAS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  1)  
(Date  unknown.)  St.  Arethas,  with  five hundred  and  four  others,  according  to  the Roman  Martyrology,  suffered  at  Rome.  They were  first  mentioned  by  TJsuard,  and  he  was copied  by  Baronius  ;  but  they  are  not  found in  more  ancient  documents.  Some  are  of opinion  that  the  Saints  of  the  same  name (Oct.  23)  martyred  at  Magran  or  Negran  in Arabia  Felix  (Aden)  are  meant.  

ARETHAS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  23)  
(6th  cent.)  St.  Arethas  was  the  Governor of  the  town  of  Negran  in  Arabia  Felix  (Aden), and  with  him  are  commemorated  innumerable Christians  of  both  sexes  who  Avere  the  victims of  the  persecution  of  a  Jewish  King  of  the Homerites,  by  name  Dunaan  or  Nowas  (A.D. 523).  A  priest,  or  Bishop,  by  name  Simeon, wrote  a  history  of  this  persecution  a  year  after the  martyrdom  of  St.  Arethas.  He  describes the  Siege  of  Negran  by  Dhu-Nwas  and  the burning  of  the  Christians  and  their  churches. Some  of  the  women  (he  says)  were  being beheaded,  when  a  little  boy  professed  his  wish to  die  with  his  mother,  Ruoma,  and  was  slain with  her.  

ARETIUS (ARECIUS, AREGIUS) and DACIAN (SS.)  MM.  (June  4)  
(Date  unknown.)  Beyond  mention  in  the Martyrologies  of  the  martyrdom  of  a  St.  Aretius at  Rome,  with  a  St.  Dacian,  and  their  burial in  the  Catacombs  on  the  Appian  Way,  nothing else  is  known.  A  St.  Pictus  is  venerated  with them  in  places.

♦ARGARIARGA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  9)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  otherwise  known as  St.  Osanna,  who  led  a  holy  life  in  Brittany, and  whose  relics  were  enshrined  at  St.  Denis near  Paris.  

ARGEUS,  NARCISSUS  and  MARCELLINUS (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  Three  brothers  who  suffered martyrdom  at  Tomis  in  Pontus  (on  the  Black Sea),  under  the  Emperor  Licinius,  who  obliged all  his  soldiers  to  offer  sacrifice  to  the  gods. Because  of  their  refusal,  the  three  brothers were  put  to  death  (A.D.  320).  Argaeus  and Narcissus  were  beheaded  and  Marcellinus  was cast  into  the  sea.  

ARGIMIRUS  (St.)  M.  (June  28)  
(9th  cent.)  A  monk  of  Cordova  in  Spain, who  was  martyred  during  the  persecution  under the  Arab  domination,  A.D.  856,  or,  according to  St.  Eulogius,  Archbishop  of  Toledo,  A.D.  858.  

ARIADNA  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  17)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Christian  woman,  slave  of  a prince  or  noble  in  Phrygia  (Asia  Minor).  She was  flogged  for  refusing  to  join  in  the  heathen rites  celebrated  on  the  anniversary  of  her master's  birthday,  but  fled  from  his  house  to the  neighbouring  hill  country.  She  evaded her  pursuers  until  a  rock  miraculously  opening offered  her  a  place  of  refuge,  closing  again  alter she  had  entered,  and  thus  procuring  for  her both  a.  tomb  and  the  crown  of  martyrdom (A.D.  130).  

ARIANUS, THEOTYCHUS and OTHERS (SS.)  MM.  (March  8)  
(3rd cent.) Arianus, Governor of Thebes (Egypt),  with  Theotychus  and  three  others, was  converted  to  Christianity  on  witnessing  at Alexandria  the  martyrdom  of  St.  Apollonius and  St.  Philemon.  The  judge  ordered  them  to be  drowned  in  the  sea.  There  is  a  legend  that their  bodies  were  brought  ashore  by  dolphins.  

♦ARILDA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  30)  
(Date uncertain.)  A Christian maiden in Gloucestershire, murdered in defence of her chastity.  The  church  at  Oldbury  is  dedicated in  her  name.  

ARISTAEUS  and  ANTONINUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  3)  
(Date  unknown.)  Though  the  Roman  Martyrology, following  those  of  Bede,  Ado  and Usuard,  describes  St.  Aristaeus  as  Bishop  of Capua  in  Italy,  modern  investigation  inclines to  identify  him  with  St.  Aristaeon,  an  Egyptian Martyr,  honoured  by  the  Greeks  on  Sept.  3. Similarly,  the  St.  Antoninus,  a  child-martyr associated  with  him,  may  be  no  other  than  the St.  Antoninus  of  either  Pamiers  in  France  or of  Apamaea  in  Syria,  commemorated  in  the Roman  Martyrology  on  Sept.  2,  though  the latter  is  usually  said  to  have  been  a  priest. At  Capua  there  is  no  record  of  either  Saint.  

ARISTARCHUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  4)  
(1st  cent.)  A  native  of  Thessalonica  and  a companion  of  St.  Paul  in  his  travels  (Acts  xx,  1 ; xxvii.  2).  He  was  seized  with  the  Apostle  at Ephesus,  and  shared  his  imprisonment.  He is  also  described  as  his  fellow-worker  (Philem. 24).  Tradition  makes  of  him  the  first  Bishop of  Thessalonica.  Pseudo-Dorotheus  has  it  that he  was  beheaded  in  Rome  at  the  same  time  as St.  Paul.  

ARISTIDES  (St.)  (Aug.  31)  
(2nd  cent.)  Both  Eusebius  and  St.  Jerome speak  of  St.  Aristides  as  an  early  Christian writer  and  an  eloquent  philosopher,  who,  like his  contemporary  Quadratus,  presented  to  the Emperor  Hadrian  an  Apologv  for  the  Christian Faith  (A.D.  133).  He  is  cited  by  Usuard (in  his  Martyrology  for  Oct.  3)  for  his  account of  the  Passion  of  St.  Dionysius  the  Areopagite. This  work,  which  was  treasured  by  the  Athenians as  a  noble  monument  of  antiquity,  is  now apparently  lost.  

ARISTION  (St.)  (Feb.  22)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  seventy-two  disciples of  Our  Lord.  He  is  mentioned  in  the  Acts  of St.  Barnabas  as  a  companion  of  the  deacon Timon,  in  the  latter's  Apostolic  labours  in  the Island  of  Cyprus.  According  to  the  Greek Menology  St.  Aristion  was  martyred  at  Alexandria, ;  according  to  others,  at  Salamis  in  Cyprus.  

ARISTOBULUS  (St.)  M.  (March  15)  
(1st  cent.)  Said  by  some  to  have  been  one of  the  seventy-two  disciples  (Luke  x.)  and  the brother  of  St.  Barnabas.  He  is  referred  to by  St.  Paul  (Rom.,  xvi.  11).  Others  make  him one  and  the  same  as  Zebedee,  Father  of  St. James  and  St.  John  the  Evangelist.  Again, there  is  a  legend  that  he  was  consecrated  a Bishop  by  St.  Peter  or  St.  Paul  and  sent  to Great  Britain,  where  he  was  martyred.  But this  last  storv  at  least  has  no  foundation.  

ARISTON,  CRESCENTIANUS,  EUTYCHIANUS, URBAN,  VITALIS,  JUSTUS,  FELICISSIMUS, FELIX, MARCIA and SYMPHOROSA (SS.)  MM.  (July  2)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  band  of  Christian  Martyrs put  to  death  in  the  Campagna  (Southern  Italy) at  the  beginning  of  the  reign  of  the  persecuting Emperor,  Diocletian  (A.D.  285).  Nothing  more is  known  about  them.  

ARISTONICUS  (St.)  M.  (April  19)  
See  SS.  HERMOGENES,  CAIUS, &c.  

♦ARMAGILLUS  (ARMEL, ERMEL, ERME) (St.) Conf. (Aug.  16)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Briton,  related  to  St.  Paul de  Leon.  A  Cornish  church  is  dedicated  to St.  Armel.  His  sphere  of  work  was  chiefly, however,  in  Brittany,  where  Plou-Ermel perpetuates  his  holy  memory.  A.D.  562  is  given as  the  date  of  his  death.  

♦ARMEL  (St.)  Conf.  (Aug.  16)  
Otherwise  St.  ARMAGILLTJS,  which  see. 

ARMENTARIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  30)  
(8th  cent.)  He  succeeded  St.  Damian (A.D.  711)  in  the  See  of  Pavia  (Italy).  During his  Episcopate,  Pope  Constantine  declared  the See  of  Pavia  to  have  always  been  immediately subject  to  the  Holy  See,  and  not  to  the  Metropolitan See  of  Milan,  as  advanced  by  St.  Benedict, Archbishop  of  Milan.  St.  Axmentarius died  A.D.  732.  His  Acts  were  lost  or  destroyed, but  his  body  was  preserved  in  the  principal church  of  Pavia.  

♦ARNOUL  (ARNULPHUS)  (St.)  M.  (July  18)  
(6th cent.)  A missionary to the Franks, contemporary of St. Remigius.  He suffered martyrdom  between  Paris  and  Chartres  about A.D.  534.  

ARMOGASTES,  MASCULAS, ARCHIMINUS  and SATURUS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  29)  
(5th  cent.)  African  victims  of  the  Arian persecution  under  Genseric,  King  of  the  Vandals. We  have  particulars  concerning  them  from  the pen  of  Victor  Vitensis,  a  trustworthy  writer  of the  following  century.  They  were  high-born nobles  at  the  Royal  Court.  Armogastes  was put  to  the  torture,  but  afterwards  made  to languish  to  death  in  slavery  "  lest  the  Romans should  venerate  him  as  a  Martyr."  The  other two  were  beheaded  about  A.D.  464.  
(See  Note  on  St.  MASCULAS.)  

ARMON  (St.)  Bp.  (July  31)  
Otherwise  St. GERMANUS  of  AUXERRE, which  see.  

♦ARNOLD  (St.)  Conf.  (July  8)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Greek  by  birth,  attached  to the  Court  of  the  Emperor  Charlemagne.  He is  described  as  a  model  of  Christian  virtue, and  has  been  venerated  above  all  for  his devotedness  to  the  poor.  He  died  shortly after  the  year  800,  and  has  left  his  name  to  the village,  Arnold -Villiers.  

ARNOUL  (ARNULPHUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (July  18)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Prankish  nobleman,  born  near Nancy  in  Lorraine,  and  educated  in  piety  and learning  by  Gondulphus,  a  councillor  of  King Theodebert  II.  He  distinguished  himself  as a  soldier  and  married  Doda,  a  lady  of  quality, by  whom  he  had  two  sons,  Clodulph  (Cloud) and  Ansegisius.  When  the  See  of  Metz  became vacant  in  the  year  613,  clergy  and  people united  in  demanding  Arnoul  (whose  wife  had just  taken  the  veil  in  a  convent  at  Treves)  as their  Bishop.  He  governed  his  Diocese  with zeal  and  success  for  about  nine  years,  and during  part  of  that  time  acted  also  as  Duke of  Austrasia  for  King  Clotaire  II.  In  his  old age  he  resigned  all  his  dignities  and  retired  to a  cave  in  the  Vosges  mountains,  where  he  died attended  by  St.  Romaric  (A.D.  641).  He  seems to  have  been  of  the  Blood  Royal  of  the  Merovingians, and  it  is  asserted  that  through  his  son Ansegisius  he  transmitted  it  to  the  succeeding French  dynasty,  that  of  the  Carolingians.  

ARNULPHUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  15)  
(11th  cent.)  A  nobleman  of  Brabant  who had  distinguished  himself  as  a  soldier,  before entering  the  Ecclesiastical  life.  After  some years  passed  in  a  monasterv  at  Soissons,  he  was appointed  Bishop  of  that  See.  He  found, however,  so  many  disorders  in  Church  discipline obtaining  among  his  flock,  that  his  efforts  to cope  with  them  literally  wore  him  out,  and in  the  end  he  was  compelled  to  retire  to  the Abbey  of  Aldenberg.  There  he  died  and  was buried  A.D.  1087.  

♦ARNULPH  (St.)  (Aug.  22)  
(9th  cent.)  Possibly  a  Huntingdonshire  Saint of  British  origin  who  may  have  lived  in  this country  in  the  ninth  century.  But  history  is silent  concerning  him  ;  and  it  is  not  improbable that  he  is  no  other  than  St.  Arnulph,  Bishop of  Metz,  the  veneration  of  a  portion  of  whose relics  at  Arnulphsbury.  or  Eynesbury,  in  Huntingdonshire, may  have  given  rise  to  the  legend that  another St. Arnulph  lived  and  died in England.  

ARPINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  9)  
Otherwise  St.  AGRIPPINUS,  which  see.  

ARSACIUS  (URSACIUS)  (St.)  Conf.  (Aug.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Persian  by  birth  and  a  soldier by  profession,  who  on  his  conversion  to  the Faith  retired  to  a  high  tower  overlooking  the city  of  Nicomedia,  where  he  lived  the  life  of  a solitary  and  became  famous  on  account  of  his gifts  of  miracles  and  prophecy.  He  is  said to  have  forewarned  the  inhabitants  of  the destruction  of  their  city  by  the  earthquake  of A.D.  358.  Some  survivors  found  Arsacius  dead in  his  tower  in  the  attitude  of  prayer.  

ARSENIUS  (St.)  Conf.  (July  19)  
(5th  cent.)  Sprung  from  a  rich  and  noble Roman  family,  his  abilities  and  love  of  work soon  placed  him  in  the  forefront  of  the  learned men  of  his  age.  The  Emperor  Theodosius chose  him  as  tutor  of  his  two  sons,  the  future Emperors  Arcadius  and  Honorius.  Declining the  honours  which  were  offered  to  him  he  bade farewell  to  the  world  and  retired  to  the  desert of  Nitria  in  Lower  Egypt.  There,  on  account of  his  continuous  prayer  and  severe  fasting, he  became  an  object  of  wonder  even  to  his  fellowhermits.  Later  he  changed  his  residence  to  a cell  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Memphis,  where  he died  in  his  ninety-fifth  year  (a.d.  450).  

ARSENIUS  (ST.)  M.  (Dec.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Martyr  of  the  Decian  persecution (A.D.  250).  St.  Dionysius  of  Alexandria in  a  letter  to  Fabius  of  Antioch  describes  the Passion  of  this  Holy  Martyr  and  of  SS.  Heron and  others  who  suffered  with  him.  He  is  there named  Ater,  changed  by  later  biographers  into Arsenius  and  Arsinus.  He  was  an  Egyptian, and  with  the  Christians,  his  companions,  was burned  to  death  at  Alexandria.  A  Christian boy,  fifteen  years  old,  was  arrested  at  the  same time,  but  only  scourged,  being  then  let  go  on account  of  his  vouth.  

♦ARTEMAS  (St.)  *M.  (Jan.  25)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Christian  bey  of  a  town near  Naples,  who  in  one  of  the  first  centuries was  on  account  of  his  religion  with  the  connivance of  those  in  authority,  murdered  by  his schoolfellows.  

ARTEMIUS,  CANDIDA  and  PAULINA (June  6) (SS.)  MM.  
(4th  cent.)  Artemius,  gaoler  of  one  of  the Roman  prisons,  with  his  wife  Candida  and daughter  Paulina,  was  converted  to  Christianity by  St.  Peter  the  Exorcist,  and  baptised  by St.  Marcellinus.  By  order  of  Serenus  the judge,  Artemius  was  beheaded,  and  his  wife and  daughter  buried  under  a  pile  of  stones (A.D.  302).  

ARTEMIUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  soldier-martyrs  of the  time  of  the  Emperor  Julian  the  Apostate, by  whose  order  he  was  beheaded  at  Antioch (A.D.  363),  after  having  been  subjected  to various  forms  of  torture.  He  was  a  veteran officer  and  had  been  placed  in  high  command by  Constantine  the  Great.  He  was  specifically charged  before  Julinn  with  having  broken  down the  statue  of  an  idol,  something  like  which  the veteran  may  likely  enough  have  been  guilty of  in  his  irritation  at  the  cruel  persecution  to which  his  fellow-Christians  were  subjected.  

ARTEMON  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  8)  
(4th  cent.;  A  priest  of  Laodicea,  burned to  death  under  Diocletian  (A.D.  305).  There is  a  good  deal  of  dispute  as  to  which  of  the several  towns  bearing  the  name  of  Laodicea, St.  Artemon  belongs.  The  probabilities  fire in  fovour  of  Laodicea  in  Phrygia.  

♦ARTHEN  (St.)  
(Date  uncertain.)  This  Saint  seems  untraceable. He  appears  to  be  one  and  the  same  with the  St.  Arvan  or  A  roan,  who  has  left  his  name at  St.  Aroans  and  Cwmcarvan  in  Monmouthshire. Stanton's  Mcnology,  following  Challoner, ARWALD identifies St. Arvan  with  Marnanus, a companion of  SS.  Banka  (or  Breaca)  and  Sennen (6th  cent.)  

♦ARWALD  (SS.)  MM.  (April  22)  
(7th  cent.)  Two  brothers,  sons  of  Arwald, a  prince  in  the  Isle  of  Wight,  whose  proper names  are  lost.  They  were  put  to  death  by the  soldiers  of  King  Ceadwalla,  then  a  Pagan, on  the  morrow  of  their  baptism  (a.d.  686).  

ASAPH  (ASA)  (St.)  Bp.  (May  1)  
(6th  cent.)  The  first  Welsh  Bishop  of  Llanelwy,  now  St.  Asaph's,  in  Flintshire.  He entered  the  monastery  built  by  St.  Kentigern of  Glasgow,  at  the  confluence  of  the  Elwy  and the  Clwydd  (A.D.  545),  and  was  appointed  his successor  as  Abbot  and  Bishop  when  St.  Kentigern returned  to  Scotland  (a.d.  573).  St. Asaph  governed  a  monastery  of  nearly  one thousand  monks,  some  of  whom  preached  and officiated  in  the  church,  while  the  rest  laboured for  the  sustenance  of  the  community  and  for the  civilisation  of  the  neighbourhood.  The exact  date  of  St.  Asaph's  death  is  not  known.  

♦ASICUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  27)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  earliest  disciples  of St.  Patrick  in  Ireland.  The  Apostle  placed him  at  the  head  of  the  monastery  and  Diocese of  Elphin,  of  which  he  is  venerated  as  the Patron-Saint.  He  lived  to  a  great  age,  dying after  the  year  500,  having  passed  the  evening of  his  life  as  a  hermit.  He  is  famous  for  his extraordinary  skill  as  a  metal-worker,  and some  remarkable  specimens  of  his  handiwork yet  remain.  

ASCLAS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  He  suffered  in  the  persecution under  Diocletian.  After  being  put  to  severe torture  he  was  thrown  into  the  Nile  at  Antinoe in  Egypt.  His  judge  thereupon  i3  said  to  have become  a  Christian  and  a  Martyr.  

ASCLEPIADES  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Oct.  18)  
(3rd  cent.)  According  to  Eusebius  of  Caesarea,  St.  Asclepiades  was  the  successor  of St.  Serapion  in  the  See  of  Antioch  (a.d.  211). He  is  also  mentioned  by  St.  Jerome,  and  appears to  have  occupied  the  See  of  Antioch  until  his death  in  a.d.  217.  No  details  are  given  of  the manner  of  his  death  and  many  are  of  opinion that  he  gained  the  title  of  Martyr  by  reason of  the  sufferings  he  underwent  during  the persecution  of  Severus  and  Macrinus.  

ASCLEPIADOTUS  (ASCLEPIADORUS)  (Sept.  15)  (St.)  M.  
See  SS.  MAXIMUS,  THEODORE, &c.  

ASELLA  (St.)  V.  (Dec.  6)  
(5th  cent.)  Her  life  virtues  and  austerity are  described  in  the  Epistles  of  St.  Jerome, where  we  are  told  that  at  the  age  of  twelve years  she  began  to  dedicate  herself  entirely  to the  service  of  God.  The  holy  Doctor  calls  her "  a  flower  of  the  Lord."  Palladius  speaks  of having  visited  her  in  Rome  (a.d.  405),  where she  was  in  charge  of  a  community  of  nuns.  

ASPREN  (St.)  Bp,  (Aug.  3)  
(1st  cent.)  Although  mention  is  not  made of  this  Saint  in  the  ancient  Menologies,  tradition from  time  immemorial  and  the  records  of  the Neapolitan  Church  abundantly  prove  his  cultus from  the  Apostolic  Age.  It  is  related  that St.  Peter  parsing  through  Naples  on  his  way from  Antioch  to  Rome,  cured  St.  Aspren  of  a serious  malady,  instructed  and  baptised  him, and  on  a  return  visit  confided  to  him  the  care of  the  Church  in  Naples.  His  conversion, miracles  and  other  works  were  depicted  on  the walls  of  the  chapel  where  he  was  interred.  

ASTERIA  (HESTERIA)  (St.)  V.M.  (Aug.  10)  
(4th  cent.)  A  holy  Martyr,  held  in  great veneration  from  time  immemorial  at  Bergamo in  Lombardy.  An  ancient  epitaph  describes her  as  having  been  beheaded  as  a  Cliristian  under Diocletian,  when  she  had  already  reached  her sixtieth  year.  The  old  MSS.  of  Bergamo  tell of  her  Christian  parentage  and  education,  and of  her  association  with  St.  Grata  in  the  burial of  St.  Alexander,  a  martyred  soldier  of  the Theban  Legion ;  also  of  her  own  death  and burial  in  the  church  of  St.  Alexander  (a.d.  307).  

ASTERIUS  (St.)  M.  (March  3)  
See  SS.  MARINUS  and  ASTERIUS.  

ASTERIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  20)  
(3rd  cent.)  Probably  a  Syrian.  He  was converted  to  Christianity  together  with  a  fellow executioner  on  beholding  the  invincible  fortitude of  the  holy  Martyr  St.  Thalalaeus,  a  Christian physician,  whom  they  were  employed  to  put to  death.  They  themselves,  with  several  other Christian  converts,  suffered  martyrdom  at Edessa  in  Mesopotamia  under  the  Emperor Numerian  (A.D.  284).  

ASTERIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  10)  
(4th  cent.)  Formerly  an  Arian,  who  after  his conversion,  became  Bishop  of  Petra  in  Arabia, and  gained  the  hatred  of  the  heretics  by  publishing the  story  of  their  intrigues  at  the  Council of  Sardica  (a.d.  347).  Banished  to  Africa  by the  Emperor  Constantius,  but  recalled  by  Julian the  Apostate,  he  assisted  at  the  Council  of Alexandria  (a.d.  362),  and  was  chosen  to  be the  bearer  of  the  letter  from  the  Council  to  the Church  of  Antioch.  He  seems  to  have  died  a year  or  two  later.  

ASTERIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  23)  
(3rd  cent.)  Three  brothers  who  were  denounced by  their  step-mother  as  Christians to  the  Pro-consul  Lysias  at  ^Egea,  a  seaport in  Cilicia  (Asia  Minor).  Two  pious  women, Domnina  and  Theonilla,  were  at  the  same  time cited  before  the  tribunal.  After  subjecting the  brothers,  Claudius,  Asterius  and  Neon, to  the  most  excruciating  tortures,  Lysias ordered  them  to  be  crucified  outside  the  walls of  the  city,  and  their  remains  to  be  left  to  the birds  of  prey  of  the  neighbourhood.  Theonilla and  Domnina,  after  undergoing  many  indignities, were  drowned  (a.d.  285).  

ASTERIUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  21)  
(3rd  cent.)  Registered  in  several  ancient Martyrologies  on  Oct.  19,  but  in  the  more  recent ones  on  Oct.  21,  he  is  described  as  a  Roman priest  ordained  by  Pope  St.  Callistus,  and  who, for  having  secretly  buried  the  body  of  that Martyr  Pope,  was  cast  into  the  Tiber  at  Ostia by  order  of  the  Emperor  Alexander  (a.d.  222). But  the  Christians  recovered  his  body  and interred  it  in  the  tomb  of  other  Martyrs  at Ostia.  In  the  year  1159  their  relics  were  more suitably  enshrined  in  the  Church  of  St.  Aurea, then  just  constructed  in  the  partially  rebuilt city.  

♦ASTERIUS  of  AMASEA  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  30)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Father  of  the  Church,  some  of whose  eloquent  sermons  are  still  extant.  He was  Bishop  of  Amasea  in  Pontus  (Asia  Minor), came  unhurt  through  the  persecution  under Julian  the  Apostate,  and  was  still  alive  in  a.d. 490.  

ASTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (July  7)  
See  SS.  PEREGRINUS,  LUCIAN, &c.  

ASYNCRITUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  8)  
(First  cent.)  Bishop  of  Hyrocania  on  the Caspian  Sea,  said  to  have  been  one  of  the seventy-two  disciples  chosen  by  Christ  and mentioned  by  St.  Paul  in  his  Epistle  to  the Romans  (xvi.  11,  14).  With  him  the  Church commemorates  St.  Herodion,  Bishop  of  Tarsus in  Cilicia,  and  St.  Phlegon,  Bishop  of  Marathon (Greece).  

ATHAN  (St.).  
Place-name  near  Pontyprydd.  No  record.  

ATHANASIA  (St.)  Widow.  (Aug.  14)  
(9th  cent.)  Her  parents  belonged  to  an ancient  Greek  family,  and  she  was  born  in  the Island  of  iEgina.  Her  first  husband  died  on the  battlefield  in  a  war  against  the  Saracens  ; but  her  second  husband  set  her  free  by  himself entering  a  monastery.  She  at  first  turned  her own  home  into  a  convent,  but,  soon,  desirous  of greater  retirement,  built  the  Abbey  of  Timia, where,  under  the  guidance  of  a  saintly  priest, she  soon  gathered  a  considerable  community. Her  virtues  and  wisdom  were  such  that  the Empress  Theodora  summoned  her  to  Constantinople. There  she  remained  seven  years, but  returned  to  die  at  Timia  (a.d.  860). ATHANASIA  (St.)  (Oct.  9)  
(5th  cent.)  The  wife  of  St.  Andronicus, who,  like  him,  on  the  death  of  their  children, embraced  the  life  of  a  solitary  in  the  desert of  Scete  in  Egypt.  In  some  Greek  accounts she  is  said  to  have  concealed  her  sex,  which  was revealed  after  death  by  a  paper  which  she  left for  her  husband,  who,  without  recognising  her, was  present  at  her  deathbed  (about  a.d.  450).  

ATHANASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  3)  
See  SS.  ZOSIMUS  and  ATHANASIUS.  

ATHANASIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  Doctor of the Church (May  2)  
(4th  cent.)  The  famous  champion  of  the Catholic  Faith  in  the  Blessed  Trinity,  against Arius,  who  denied  the  Divinity  of  Christ  and was  upheld  by  powerful  partisans.  Born  at Alexandria  in  Egypt,  St.  Athanasius  was ordained  deacon  by  St.  Alexander,  Patriarch of  that  city,  and  succeeded  him  as  Bishop (a.d.  326),  having  in  the  previous  year  taken part  in  the  great  Council  of  Nicaea.  During his  long  Episcopate  his  life  was  frequently  in danger,  and  he  had,  at  several  periods,  to  keep flying  from  place  to  place.  Eventually  he returned  in  triumph  to  his  Church,  and  died at  Alexandria,  a.d.  373.  His  piety,  learning and  unparalleled  energy  made  of  him  the  most conspicuous  figure  of  the  age  in  which  he  lived  ; and  he  has  left  many  and  valuable  writings. Truly,  as  St.  Gregory  Nazianzen  styles  him, was  he  a  "  pillar  of  the  Church."  

ATHANASIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  5)  
(5th  cent.)  A  deacon  of  Jerusalem.  He denounced  the  heretic  Theodosius,  who  had supplanted  the  Catholic  St.  Juvenal  in  the  See of  Jerusalem.  For  his  act  of  zeal  the  good deacon  was  seized  by  the  soldiery,  scourged and  beheaded  (a.d.  452).  

ATHANASIUS  (St.)  Bp. '  (July  15)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Naples,  known  as Athanasius  the  First,  to  distinguish  him  from his  unworthy  successor  of  the  same  name. His  brother,  Sergius  I,  Duke  of  Naples,  placed his  son  under  the  care  of  St.  Athanasius,  but  the young  man  at  the  instigation  of  his  wife  and courtiers  cast  his  uncle  into  prison.  The  clergy and  people  of  Naples  soon  forced  Sergius  to release  their  bishop,  but  the  young  Duke threatened  him  with  worse  than  imprisonment unless  he  abdicated.  The  Emperor  Louis  II then  intervened  and  sent  the  Duke  of  Amalfi to  conduct  Athanasius  to  a  place  of  safety. The  Saint  died  at  Veroli,  and  was  buried  at Monte  Cassino  (a.d.  872).  His  body  was  soon afterwards  translated  to  the  Cathedral  of  Naples.  

ATHANASIUS, ANTHUSA and OTHERS (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Athanasius  was  a  Bishop  of Tarsus  in  Asia  Minor,  and  famous  for  the holiness  of  his  life.  He  fell  a  victim  to  the cruelty  of  the  persecuting  Emperor  Valerian (about  a.d.  257).  St.  Anthnsa,  a  wealthy  lady of  one  of  the  various  Asiatic  cities  named Seleucia,  had  previously  come  to  Tarsus  to  seek baptism  at  the  hands  of  St.  Athanasius.  Having thus  become  a  Christian,  and  having  on  that account  been  driven  out  of  Seleucia.  she  embraced the  life  of  a  solitary  in  the  desert, persevering  therein  until  her  death,  twentythree  years  later.  Two  servants  who  had «+  ?  u  her  to  Tarsus  found  a  home  with 8t.  Athanasius,  and  in  the  end  shared  his  crown of  martyrdom.  

♦ATHELM  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  8)  
(10th  cent.)  The  uncle  of  St.  Dunstan.  He was  the  first  Bishop  of  Wells  in  Somerset,  and afterwards  Archbishop  of  Canterbury,  which bee  lie  governed  from  a.d.  914  to  his  death  in a.d.  923. 

ATHENODORUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Oct.  18)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  brother  of  St.  Gregory Thaumaturgus,  and  a  native  of  Neo-Caesarea in  Cappadocia.  They  were  both  pupils  of Origen,  and  together  combated  the  teaching of  Paul  of  Samosata  in  the  first  Council  of Antioch.  St.  Athenodorus  is  said  to  have  been put  to  death  during  the  persecution  of  Aurelian about  the  year  269.  No  mention  is  made  of the  See  of  which  he  was  Bishop,  but  it  is  commonly supposed  to  have  been  Neo-Caesarea itself,  where  he  may  have  succeeded  his  brother.  

ATHENODORUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  Christian  victims immolated  during  the  presidency  of  Eleusius in  Mesopotamia,  under  the  Emperor  Diocletian. He  survived  many  tortures,  and  was  bound  at last  to  the  stake.  But  the  fire  refused  to  burn  ; whereupon  the  executioner  was  summoned  to behead  him.  However,  the  man  fell  dead  at the  feet  of  the  Martyr,  and,  no  substitute  being found,  Athenodorus  was  suffered  to  die  in  peace. He  passed  away  while  engaged  in  an  ecstasy  of prayer,  only  a  few  hours  later  (A.D.  304).  

ATHENOGENES  (St.)  M.  (June  18)  
(2nd  cent.)  An  aged  priest,  who  while  being burned  at  the  stake,  somewhere  in  Pontus  (Asia Minor),  is  said  to  have  repeated  the  beautiful Evening  Hymn  which  he  had  formerly  composed, and  which  still  forms  a  striking  feature in  the  Greek  Vesper  service.  The  date  of  his martyrdom  is  given  as  A.D.  196.  St.  Basil quotes  him  as  an  authority  on  theological questions.  But  there  is  much  obscurity  about him.  The  learned  Cardinal  Baronius  goes  so far  as  to  think  he  may  be  identical  with  the well-known  Christian  writer  Athenagoras. St.  Athenogenes  has  also  been  credited  with  the composition  of  the  hymn,  Gloria  in  excelsis.  

ATHENOGENES  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  16)  
(4th  cent.) A  Bishop  with  ten  of  his  flock, put  to  death  by  the  President  Hirernarchus  at Sebaste  in  Armenia  (a.d.  302),  during  the  great persecution  under  Diocletian  and  his  colleagues.

(12th  cent.)  Badajoz  in  Spam  and  Florence in  Italy  put  forth  rival  claims  to  have  been  the birthplace  of  this  Saint.  From  having  been Abbot  of  Vallombrosa,  he  was  chosen  Bishop of  Pistoia,  also  in  Tuscany,  and  occupied  that See  for  twenty  years.  He  died  a.d.  1153. He  has  left  a  work  on  the  miracles  and  relics  of St.  James  of  Compostella.

(4th  cent.)  One  of  nine  Christian  husbandmen, among  whom  Leontius  and  Alexander  are also  mentioned  by  name.  They  were  beheaded at  Perge  in  Pamphylia  (Asia  Minor)  in  the  great persecution  under  Diocletian.  The  fact  that these  were  poor  peasants,  quite  uncultured  and yet  heroes  in  their  fight  for  Christ,  appears  to have  greatly  impressed  their  contemporaries.  

ATTICUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  6)  
(Date  unknown.)  Although  the  Roman Martyrology  registers  St.  Atticus  without  giving him  the  title  of  Martyr,  various  other  reliable lists  describe  him  as  a  Martyr  in  Phrygia.  Further information  respecting  him  is  wanting.  

ATTILANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  5)  
(11th  cent.)  Born  at  Tarragona  or  Tarascona in  Aragon  (Spain),  in  early  youth  he  entered the  Benedictine  Order  and  became  the  disciple of  the  holy  Abbot  St.  Froilan,  who  later  chose Attilanus  as  his  Prior  and  substitute.  The two  Sees  of  Leon  and  Zamora  becoming  vacant, St.  Froilan  was  appointed  to  the  former  and St.  Attilanus  to  the  latter,  and  they  were consecrated  together  on  Whit-Sunday,  a.d.  990. St.  Attilanus  governed  his  flock  in  a  period  of great  trouble  and  distress.  He  died  A.d.  909, and  was  canonised  A.D.  1098.  

♦ATTRACTA  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  11)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  probably  a contemporary  of  St.  Patrick.  Having  embraced the  religious  life,  she  founded  a  monastery  in the  present  County  of  Sligo  (Killaraght),  and another  in  the  County  of  Roscommon.  She was  renowned  far  and  wide  for  her  charity  to the  poor  and  for  the  hospitality  she  extended to  wayfarers  and  to  the  homeless.  Precise dates  cannot  be  fixed  with  any  certainty.  

AUBERT  (ALBERT,  AUDEBERTUS,  AUTHBERT)  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  13)  
(7th  cent.)  One  of  the  greatest  and  most illustrious  Bishops  and  Saints  of  his  age  in  the North  of  France.  Appointed  in  the  year  633 Bishop  of  the  United  Sees  of  Cambrai  and Arras,  his  position  and  character  enabled  him to  enlist  the  services  of  princes  and  conspicuous personages  in  spreading  the  Faith  through  the vast  districts  committed  to  his  pastoral  care. He  built  many  churches  and  monasteries,  and others  were  founded  by  the  converts  to  Christianity he  was  daily  making.  King  Dagobert chose  him  for  his  adviser  in  temporal,  no  less than  in  spiritual  matters.  After  a  glorious Episcopate  of  thirty-six  years  he  passed  away, about  A.d.  669,  and  was  buried  in  the  church of  St.  Peter  near  Cambrai,  to  which  later  an Abbey  was  attached.

AUCTUS,  TAURIO  and  THESSALONICA  (Nov.  7) (SS.)  MM.  
(Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  at  Amphipolis, anciently  an  important  city  of  Western  Macedonia. They  are  commemorated  in  both  the Eastern  and  Western  Calendars ;  but  neither reliable  particulars  nor  date  of  their  martyrdom can  be  found.

AUDAS  (ABDAS)  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (May  16)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Persian  Bishop  who  is  said to  have  set  fire  to  a  temple  of  the  god  of  fire. Ordered  to  rebuild  it  at  his  own  expense,  he refused  to  do  so.  His  conduct  was  made  the pretext  for  a  relentless  persecution  of  Christianity. St.  Audas,  with  seven  priests,  nine  deacons and  seven  virgins,  was  among  the  first  victims (A.D.  420).  But  there  are  considerable  doubts as  to  the  date  and  particulars  of  these  martyrdoms. The  destruction  in  Persia  of  Christian property  in  any  way  connected  with  religion  was so  indiscriminate  that  all  records,  if  there  were any,  are  lost.

AUDOMARUS  (OMER)  (St.)  P.  (Sept.  9)  
(7th  cent.)  Born  at  Ooldenthal  near  the Lake  of  Constance,  in  the  sixth  century,  on  the death  of  his  mother,  he  and  his  father  became monks  in  the  Abbey  of  Luxeuil,  under  S. Eustace.  Here  St.  Audomarus  gained  such  a reputation  for  sanctity  and  learning  that  King Dagobert,  encouraged  by  the  wishes  of  the clergy,  advised  thereto  by  St.  Acharius,  Bishop of  Noyon,  chose  the  young  monk  to  rule  over the  extensive  Diocese  of  Terouanne  (now St.  Omer),  which  was  sorely  in  need  of  a  zealous pastor.  By  his  exemplary  life  and  untiring energy,  the  new  Bishop  suppressed  idolatry and  transformed  his  Diocese  into  one  of  the most  flourishing  in  France.  He  founded  the famous  Abbey  of  Sithiu,  later  known  as  St. Bertin.  In  his  old  age  he  became  blind,  but never  relaxed  his  endeavours  to  do  good  and  to win  souls  to  God.  He  died  a.d.  670,  and  was buried  in  the  church  which  has  since  become the  Cathedral  of  St  Omer.  

AUDOENUS  (AUDEON,  OUEN,  OWEN,  DADON) (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  24)  
(7th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  son  of  Autharius and  Aiga,  who  after  their  death  were  also,  at least  locally,  venerated  as  Saints,  and  to  whom St.  Columbanus  is  said  to  have  foretold  that their  son  Ouen  and  his  two  brothers,  Ardon  and Radon,  would  become  famous  in  Church  and State.  St.  Ouen  was  entrusted  with  high offices  at  the  Courts  of  Clotaire  and  Dagobert. There  he  met  and  formed  a  close  friendship with  St.  Eligius  (Eloi).  Both  of  these  noblemen resolving  on  entering  the  Ecclesiastical state,  they  were  consecrated  on  the  same  day by  Adeodatus,  Bishop  of  Macon,  Bishops Eloi  of  Noyon  and  Ouen  of  Rouen,  where  the latter  succeeded  St.  Romanus  (a.d.  640).  The activity  and  success  of  St.  Ouen  in  promoting the  cause  of  Christianity  and  civilisation  in the  future  province  of  Normandy  was  such that  in  life  as  in  death  he  was  acclaimed  as  a Saint.  He  passed  away  after  more  than  forty years  of  a  most  fruitful  Episcopate,  at  Clichy, near  Paris  (a.d.  683),  and  was  buried  in  the Abbey  of  St.  Pierre,  hear  Rouen,  to  which  his name  was  given.  There  have  been  several translations  of  his  relics,  the  last  in  the  year 1860.  He  has  left  us  the  Life  of  his  friend, St.  Eligius — an  historical  treasure,  considering the  dark  century  in  which  it  was  written.  

AUDREY  (AWDREY)  (St.)  V.  (June  23)  
Othencise  St.  ETHELDREDA  or  EDILTEJJDIS,  ivhich  see. AUGULUS  (AUGUSTUS)  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Feb.  7) (4th  cent.) His  name  appears  in  the  Martyrology of St. Jerome as a Bishop.  Other ancient authorities  describe  him  as  a  Martyr who  laid  down  his  life  for  Christ  in  London. This  would  be  in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian in  which  St.  Alban  suffered  about  A.D. 303.  St.  Augulus  is  called  Augustus  by Venerable  Bede,  and  Augurius  by  some  other authors.  He has been identified by French writers  with  St.  Ouil  or  Aule  of  Normandy.  

AUGURIUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  21)  
See  SS.  FRUCTUOSUS,  AUGURIUS, &c.  

♦  AUGUSTA  (St.)  V.M.  (March  27)  
(Date  uncertain.) The  daughter  of  one  of the  Barbarian  chiefs  who  overran  Italy  at  the time  of  the  fall  of  the  Roman  Empire. It  is said  that  he,  being  a  heathen,  was  so  angered at  finding  that  his  child  had  become  a  Christian that he slew her with his own hand.  St. Augusta  is  still  venerated  in  some  of  the  Alpine villages  in  the  north  of  Italy.  

AUGUSTALIS  (AUTAL)  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  7)  
(Date  uncertain.) According  to  all  records, this  Saint  was  a  Bishop,  but  opinions  vary  as to  his  See.  The  most  probable  opinion  is  that he  was  Bishop  of  Aries  (third  or  fourth  century).  
The  Roman  Martyrology  simply  states  that  he was  a  Bishop  in  Gaul.  Saint-Marthe  and  Gams place  his  name  between  those  of  Ravennius  and Leontius  (455-462)  in  their  lists  of  the  Bishops of  Aries.  

AUGUSTINE  of  NICOMEDIA  (St.)  M. (May  7)  
See  SS.  FLAVIAN,  AUGUSTINE, &c.  

AUGUSTINE  of  CANTERBURY  (St.)  Bp.  (May  26)  
(7th  cent.) St.  Augustine  shares  with  St. Gregory  the  Great  the  title  of  Apostle  of  the English.  St.  Gregory  himself,  hefore  his advancement  to  the  Papal  See,  set  out  to convert  the  English,  but  was  recalled  to  Rome. Five  years  after  his  election  to  the  Pontifical Chair,  he  sent  forth  a  band  of  forty  monks from  the  monastery  of  St.  Andrew  in  Rome, under  their  Prior  Augustine,  to  begin  a  mission in  England.  They  landed  at  or  near  Ebbsfleet in  the  Isle  of  Thanet,  where  they  were  received and  listened  to  by  King  St.  Ethelbert,  who received  Baptism  and  established  the  holy missionaries  at  Canterbury  (A.D.  597).  St. Augustine  was  consecrated  the  first  Archbishop of  Canterbury,  it  is  said,  by  Virgilius,  the Metropolitan  of  Aries.  St.  Gregory,  on  hearing of  the  success  of  the  mission,  sent  the  pallium (an  ornament  distinctive  of  Archbishops)  to Augustine,  together  with  a  reinforcement  of labourers,  among  whom  were  Mellitus,  Paulinus and  Justus.  These  were  appointed  to  the  Sees of  London,  York  and  Rochester.  St.  Augustine died  within  a  short  time  of  St.  Gregory  Oa.d. 604).  He  was  buried  in  the  Abbey  church  without the  walls  of  Canterbury,  which  he  had founded.  

AUGUSTINE  of  HIPPO  (St.)  Bp.,  (Aug.  28)  Doctor  of  the  Church.  
(5th  cent.)  He  was  born  at  Tagasta,  a  town of  Numidia  (near  Algiers  in  Africa),  a.d.  354. In  his  youth  he  went  headlong  into  vice,  and all  but  became  a  Manichaean.  He  taught Rhetoric  at  Tagasta,  Carthage,  Rome  and Milan.  In  the  latter  city  he  met  St.  Ambrose and  attended  his  sermons,  which,  with  the  aid of  St.  Simplician,  a  priest,  brought  about  his conversion.  He  was  baptised  by  St.  Ambrose in  the  presence  of  his  holy  mother, St.  Monica  (a.d.  387).  On  his  return  to  Africa he  lived  in  solitude  for  three  years,  and  was then  consecrated  Bishop  of  Hippo.  In  this high  station  he  displayed  great  zeal  and  learning in  repelling  the  attacks  of  the  Pagans,  Manichaeans,  Arians,  Donatists  and  Pelagians.  His writings  fill  many  folio  volumes,  his  best-known work  being  the  City  of  God  and  his  Confessions. He  died  A.D.  430  in  his  seventy-sixth  year, and  was  buried  at  Hippo  in  the  church  of St.  Stephen.  In  the  year  498,  owing  to  the irruption  of  the  Vandals,  his  relics  were  transferred to  Sardinia  by  the  exiled  African  Bishops, and  interred  at  Cagliari.  When  Sardinia  fell into  the  hands  of  the  Saracens,  his  relics  were carried  to  Pavia  (A.D.  772)  and  placed  in  the triple  crypt  of  the  Basilica  of  St.  Peter.

AUGUSTUS  (St.)  Conf.  (Oct.  7)  
(6th  cent.) A  saintly  Abbot  of  Bourges  in France,  friend  of  St.  Germanus  of  Paris.  He  is chiefly  notable  for  having  discovered  the  body (still  incorrupt)  of  St.  Ursinus,  Apostle  of  the neighbourhood.  He was remarkable for his austere  piety,  witnessed  to  by  many  miracles.  He  died  towards  the  close  of  the  sixth  century.

AURA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  19)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Spanish  nun  of  Cordova, daughter  of  intidel  parents,  who  themselves denounced  her  to  the  Mohammedan  officials  as a  convert  to  Christianity.  She  was  in  consequence beheaded  (a.d  856).  

AUREA  (St.)  V.M.  (Aug.  24)  
(3rd  cent.)  Out  of  many  varied  histories  of the  passion  of  this  Saint  it  may  be  gathered  that she  was  thrown  into  the  sea  at  Ostia  at  the mouth  of  the  Tiber,  after  undergoing  many tortures,  by  order  of  Alpius  Romulus,  a  Prefect under  the  Emperor  Claudius  (a.d.  260).  She appears to have been associated with SS.  Quiriacus,  Maximus  and  Archelaus  (Aug.  23), and  to  have  been  one  of  those  devout  women who used to visit the Christians in prison, attend  to  their  needs,  and  give  them  decent burial.  

AUREA  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  4)  
(7th cent.) A Syrian lady, who became Abbess  of  the  convent  of  St.  Martial  at  Paris, founded  a.d.  633  by  St.  Eligius,  in  honour  of St.  Martial  of  Limoges.  St.  Ouen,  in  his  Life of  St.  Eligius,  speaks  of  her  in  terms  of  great praise.  Many  miracles  during  her  life  and  after her death bore eloquent testimony to her sanctity.  She  died  in  the  year  666,  with  one hundred  and  sixty  of  her  community,  victims of  the  plague,  then  raging  in  France,  and  they were  buried  in  the  Church  of  St.  Paul  outside the  city  walls.  

AURELIA  and  NEOMISIA  (SS.)  VV.  (Sept.  25)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Both  are  believed  to  have been  of  Asiatic  origin.  They  visited  the  Holy Places  in  Syria  and  Palestine,  and  the  Tombs of  the  Apostles  in  Rome.  At  Capua  they  were maltreated  by  the  Saracens,  but  escaped  under cover  of  a  thunderstorm.  They  took  shelter at  Macerata,  near  Anagni,  where  they  died.  

AURELIA  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  15)  
(11th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  a  princess  of France,  of  the  family  of  Hugues  Capet,  and  to have  fled  in  disguise  to  Strasburg,  in  order  to escape a  marriage arranged against  her  will by  her  parents.  Following  the  advice  of  St. Wolfgang,  Bishop  of  Ratisbon,  who  penetrated her  disguise,  she  embraced  the  life  of  a  Solitary and  took  up  her  abode  in  a  hermitage  where she  remained  for  about  fifty-two  years.  The fame of her sanctity, borne witness to by several miracles, was already widespread at the  time  of  her  holy  death  in  the  year 1027.  Her  relics were  worthily  enshrined, and her hermitage  converted  into  a  chapel  which  became a  place  of  popidar  pilgrimage.  

AURELIA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  2)  

See  SS.  EUSEBIUS,  MARCELLUS, &c. AURELIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (June  16)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  the  South  of  France, particulars  of  whose  early  life  are  not  extant. On  his  election  to  the  See  of  Aries  (a.d.  546) he  received  the  Pallium  from  Pope  Vigilius, whose  vicar  in  Gaul  he  became.  He  founded two  monasteries,  one  for  monks  and  one  for nuns,  and  wrote  a  special  Rule  for  their  guidance. He  assisted  at  the  Council  of  Orleans (A.D.  549),  and  died  two  years  afterwards  at Lvons.  

♦AURELIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  20)  
(5th cent.) An Archbishop of Carthage, fellow-worker with St. Augustine of Hippo, and  the  first  to  detect  and  condemn  the  heresy of  Pelagius.  He  died  a.d.  423.

See  SS.  GEORGE  and  AURELIUS. {These  Saints  are  probably  identical  vrith  the group in which  the  same  names occur, commemorated on  July  27.)  

AURELIUS  and  PUBLIUS  (SS.)  (Nov.  12)  Bps.,  MM.  
(2nd  cent.)  Two  Bishops  who  each  wroto a  confutation  of  the  errors  of  the  Montanists or  Cata-Phrygians.  Tradition  has  it  that  both suffered  martyrdom,  but  whether  in  Asia  or  in Northern  Africa,  seems  uncertain.  

AUREUS,  JUSTINA  and  OTHERS  (June  16)  (SS.)  MM.  
(Date  uncertain.)  During  an  invasion  of Huns  or  other  savages,  St.  Aureus,  Bishop  of Mentz,  was  driven  from  his  See  and  was  followed into  exile  by  his  sister,  St.  Justina.  On his  return  to  Mentz,  his  zeal  for  the  restoration of  Christian  discipline  so  angered  certain  evildoers  that  while  the  Bishop  was  celebrating Mass  they  murdered  him  and  his  sister.  They certainly  lived  before  the  seventh  century Apostolate  of  St.  Boniface  in  Germany,  but  no reliable  date  can  be  assigned  them.  

AUSPICIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  8)  
(2nd  cent.)  He  is  said  to  have  been  the fourth  Bishop  of  Treves  and  successor  to St.  Maternus  (about  A.D.  130).  Some  authorities, however,  assert  his  identity  with  St. Auspicius,  the  fifth  century  Bishop  of  Toul. Again,  some  refer  to  him  as  a  Martyr,  others simplv  as  a  Confessor.  

AUSTELL  (St.)  Conf.  (June  28)  
(6th  cent.)  A  disciple  in  Cornwall  of  St. Me  wan  or  Me  van.  He  lived  as  a  hermit  in  the latter  half  of  the  sixth  century,  probably  in the  district  where  a  place-name  preserves  his memory.  There  is  no  account  extant  of  St. Austell ;  and  some  moderns  have  conjectured that  Austell  (Hawystill)  is  a  woman  Saint, one  of  the  daughters  of  the  famous  Brychan of  Wales,  who  has  perhaps  left  her  name  to  Aust or  Awst  in  Gloucestershire.  

♦AUSTREBERTA  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  10)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  the  North  of  France who  fled  from  her  home  to  escape  being  forced into  a  marriage  against  her  will.  She  received the  veil  from  St.  Omer.  She  died  Abbess  of Pavilly  A.D.  704.  Some  of  her  relics  are  said to  have  been  brought  to  Canterbury  by  the Norman  invaders  (A.D.  1066).  

♦AUSTREGILDA  (St.)  Widow.  (Sept.  1)  
Otherwise  St.  AGIA,  which  see.  

AUSTROGISILUS  (AOUSTRILLE,  OUTRILLE) (St.)  Bp.  (May  20)  
(7th  cent.)  An  attendant  at  the  Court  of King  Gontram  at  Chalon-sur-Saone.  His virtues  induced  JStherius,  Bishop  of  Lyons, to  ordain  him  priest  and  to  appoint  him  Abbot of  the  monastery  of  St.  Nizier.  On  the  death of  St.  Apollinaris  (A.D.  612)  he  was  elected  to the  See  of  Bourges,  where  he  died  (A.D.  624), bewailed  by  his  flock  and  was  speedily  by  the Bishops  of  Gaul  declared  worthy  of  public veneration  as  a  Saint.  

♦AUTHAIRE  (OYE)  (St.)  (April  24)  
(7th  cent.)  A  nobleman  of  the  Court  of King  Dagobert  of  France,  and  the  father  of St.  Ouen  of  Rouen.  St.  Authaire  distinguished himself  by  his  lavish  charity  to  the  poor. Hence  the  village  where  he  died  (Ussy  near La  Ferte-sous-Jouarre)  chose  him  after  his death  for  its  Patron  Saint.  

AUSTREMONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  1)  
(Date  uncertain.)  According  to  traditional belief  in  France,  Austremontius  was  one  of  the missionaries  sent  into  Gaul  by  the  Apostle St.  Peter  himself.  His  field  of  labour  lay principally  in  the  province  now  known  as Auvergne.  After  thirty-six  years  of  successful missionary  work,  the  Saint  is  said  to  have  retired into  solitude  to  prepare  himself  for  death. It  is  further  asserted  that  in  the  end  certain evildoers,  or  perhaps  an  exasperated  mob  of heathens,  sought  him  out  and  did  him  to  death. The  modern  view  is  that  St.  Austremontius was  one  of  seven  missionaries  sent  from  Rome into  Gaul,  but  by  one  of  the  Popes  of  the  third century,  that  is,  two  hundred  years  later  than the  older  legend  set  forth.  That  Austremontius preached  in  Auvergne  and  may  properly  be regarded  as  the  first  Bishop  of  Clermont  is quite  in  conformity  with  the  result  of  scientific enquiry.  

AUSTRICLINIAN  (St.)  (June  30)  
(Date  uncertain.)  One  of  two  Roman priests,  the  other  being  St.  Alpinianus,  who accompanied  St.  Martial  into  Gaul,  where  they spent  their  lives  with  that  Saint  in  preaching Christianity  in  the  country  round  Limoges. But  in  this  as  in  similar  instances  of  the  preaching of  Roman  missionaries  in  ancient  France, it  is  now  usual  to  accept  the  facts  but  to  postdate the  mission  for  two  centuries. To  explain the  possible  error,  it  should  be  noted  that  for many  centuries,  messengers  and  letters  from  the Popes  of  Rome  were  commonly  designated  as coming  from  St.  Peter  himself.  Whence, easily  enough,  in  later  ages  they  got  to  be  antedated to  Apostolic  times.

Alleged  by  the  Greeks  to  have been  an  Italian  Bishop,  who,  to  escape  the  fury of  the  persecution  under  Diocletian,  fled  into Bithynia  in  Asia  Minor,  where  he  made  many converts  to  Christianity  and  afterwards  suffered death  for  the  Faith.  This  must  have  been about  A.D.  300.  The  Life  of  St.  Autonomus we  possess  was  not  written  till  the  sixth century.  

AUXANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  3)

(5th  cent.)  Born  in  Syria,  but  of  Persian ancestry,  he  served  as  a  soldier  in  the  bodyguard of  the  Emperor  Theodosius  the  Younger. Later  in  life  he  retired  to  the  Desert  of  Oxea  in Bithynia,  where  he  gathered  disciples  around him.  He  appeared  to  have  done  all  that  was in  his  power  in  defence  of  the  Catholic  Faith at  the  time  of  the  Council  of  Chalcedon  ;  but speedily  returned  to  his  cell,  and  soon  after passed  away.

AUXENTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  18)  
(4th  cent.)  At  one  time  a  soldier  in  the  army of  the  Emperor  Licinius,  he  had  to  suffer,  like other  Christians,  for  refusing  to  take  part  in heathen  sacrifices.  But  he  survived  the  persecution and,  embracing  the  Ecclesiastical  state, in  due  course  became  Bishop  of  Mopsueste  in Cilicia  (A.D.  321).  The  date  of  his  death  is  not given.  

AUXIBIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  19)

Many  miracles are  recounted  worked  through  his  prayers. He  subscribed  the  Acts  of  the  Council  of  Orleans (A.D.  511)  which  he  probably  survived  some years.  A  translation  of  his  relics  was  celebrated in  the  year  1853.  

AVENTINUS  (St.)  (Feb.  4)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  in  one  of  the  Central Provinces  of  France,  he  acted  as  Almoner  to St.  Lupus,  Bishop  of  Troyes,  until,  moved  by a  desire  of  living  a  life  of  greater  perfection, he  withdrew  from  the  world  into  a  solitude, and  after  some  time  was  ordained  priest.  To the  retired  spot  where  he  lived  and  died  (A.D. 538)  he  has  left  his  name,  St  Aventin.

(8th  cent.)  A  holy  hermit  in  the  Pyrenees, put  to  death  by  the  Moors,  when  making  that great  inroad  of  theirs  into  France,  which  led  to the  total  destruction  of  their  armies  at  Poictiers bv  Charles  Martel  (A.d.  732).  

♦AVERTINUS  (St.)  Conf.  (May  5)  
(12th  cent.)  A  Gilbertine  Canon,  the  faithful friend  of  St.  Thomas  of  Canterbury,  who  followed the  holy  Martyr  into  exile,  and  after  his death  devoted  himself  in  France  to  the  service of  the  poor.

AVITUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  27)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Saint  of  this  name  is honoured  as  Patron  and  Bishop  of  the  Canary Islands,  and  is  supposed  to  have  reached  them in  Apostolic  times,  to  have  preached  the  Gospel there,  and  finally  to  have  been  put  to  death for  the  Faith.  The  translation  thither  in  the fifteenth  century  of  the  relics  of  some  early Martyr  may  have  given  rise  to  the  legend.  

AVITUS  of  VIENNE  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  5)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  in  Auvergne  and  brother to  St.  Apollinaris,  Bishop  of  Valence.

St.  Avitus  succeeded  him  and presided  over  the  famous  Council  of  Epaon. It  was  he  who  converted  the  Burgnndian  King Sigismund,  who  became  a  monk  and  a  Saint. Only  a  few  of  the  homilies,  poems  and  letters of  St.  Avitus  have  been  preserved.  He  was buried  in  the  Cathedral  of  Vienne  (A.D.  525).

AZAS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  19)

BABILAS,  URBAN,  PRILIDION  and  EPOLONIUS (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  24)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Babilas,  for  thirteen  years Bishop  of  Antioch,  is  said  to  have  forbidden the  Emperor  Philip  (reputed  a  Christian)  the entrance  to  a  church  until  he  had  publicly repented  of  a  murder  of  which  he  was  guilty. St.  Babilas  died  in  chains,  awaiting  execution, during  the  Decian  persecution  (A.D.  250).  With him  are  commemorated  three  youths,  his  pupils, privileged  with  him  to  lay  down  their  lives  for Christ.  

♦BABILLA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  20)  
(3rd  cent.)  Babilla  or  Basilla  was  a  niece of  the  Emperor  Gallienus  and  baptised  by  Pope St.  Cornelius.  Accused  by  one  of  her  maids of  being  a  Christian  and  forced  to  choose  between marriage  with  a  Pagan  and  death,  she  elected martyrdom.  She  was  beheaded  and  buried in  the  catacombs  of  the  Via  Salaria,  outside Rome  (a.d.  270).  St.  Babilla  seems  to  be identical  with  the  St.  Basilla  commemorated in  the  Roman  Martyrology  on  May  20.  

BABOLEN  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  26)  
(7th  cent.)  A  monk  of  unknown  nationality but  of  the  school  of  St.  Columbanus  of  Luxeuil, and  allied  with  St.  Fursey.  He  laboured  for the  good  of  souls  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Paris where  he  governed  the  monastery  of  St.  Maurdes-Fosses.

♦BAGLAN  (St.)  
(Date  unknown.)  There  are  two  Welsh Saints  of  this  name,  the  one  and  the  other attributed  to  the  fifth  century,  but  beyond  the fact  of  there  being  existing  churches  dedicated in  their  honour,  and  a  mention  in  an  ancient litany,  nothing  is  known  of  them.  

♦BAIN  (St.)  Bp.  (June  20)  
(8th  cent.)  Bishop  of.Terouanne  (St.  Omer). After  a  fruitful  Episcopate  he  retired  to  the monastery  of  St.  Wandrille  (Fontenelle)  in Normandy,  and  later  presided,  in  addition, over  that  of  Fleury  or  St.  Benoit-sur-Loire. He  passed  away  about  A.D.  711.  

♦BAISIL  (St.)  
(Date  unknown.)  Patron  of  a  church  in Llandaff  Diocese.  There  is  no  record  of  such a  Saint  in  Welsh  Hagiology.  It  may  be  that Baisil  is  only  a  misspelling  of  some  other  appellative.  

♦BAITHIN  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  9)  
(6th  cent.)  Also  called  Comin  or  Cominus, and  described  as  first  cousin  to  St.  Columbkille, by  whom  he  was  educated,  and  whom  he succeeded  as  Abbot  of  Hy  or  Iona.  He  is  said to  have  died  (a.d.  598)  on  the  anniversary  of the  death  of  St.  Columba.

See  SS.  LIBERATUS  and  BAJULUS.  

BALBINA  (St.)  V.M.  (March  31)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  daughter  of  the  Roman Tribune,  St.  Quirinus  the  Martyr.  She  was baptised  together  with  both  her  parents  by Pope  St.  Alexander.  It  appears  that  she ended  her  life  by  martyrdom,  about  a.d.  130, but  whether  she  was  drowned  or  buried  alive is  a  matter  of  dispute.  

BALDOMER  (St.)  Conf.  (Feb.  27)  
(7th  cent.)  Better  known  as  St.  Galmier. He  was  by  trade  a  locksmith  at  Lyons,  and  late in  life  retired  to  the  monastery  of  St.  Justus under  the  Abbot  Viventius,  and  was  ordained sub-deacon.  He  died  about  a.d.  650,  and  is represented  in  art  carrying  pincers  and  locksmith's tools.  He  is  reputed  the  Patron  Saint of  those  of  his  old  trade.  

BALDERIC  (BAUDRY)  (St.)  Conf.  (Oct.  27)  
(7th  cent.) He, with  his  sister  St. Bova, were  children  of  Sigebert  I,  King  of  Austrasia (Eastern  France  and  Western  Germany). He led  a  life  of  prayer  and  penance  in  a  monastery near  Rheims,  and  after  his  death  was  venerated as  a  Saint.

(7th  cent.)  A  Scottish  Bishop  alleged  to have  been  the  successor  of  St.  Kentigeru  or Mungo,  at  Glasgow,  and  to  have  ended  his  life as  a  hermit  on  the  coast  of  the  Frith  of  Forth. The  date  usually  given  as  that  of  his  death would  of  course  have  to  be  corrected  if  he  could be  proved  to  be  (as  some  surmise)  one  and  the same  person  with  St.  Balther,  hermit,  also commemorated  on  March  6.  

BALDWIN  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  8)  
(7th  cent.)  Archdeacon  of  Laon  in  the  time of  Dagobcrt  I,  King  of  France.  He  was  a  son of  St.  Salaberga  and  brother  of  St.  Anstrude, Abbess  of  Laon.  He  was  murdered  about a.d.  680,  in  circumstances  which  have  led  to his  being  honoured  as  a  martyr.   

♦BALIN  (BALANUS,  BALLOIN)  (St.)  (Sept.  3)  
(7th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  the  brother  of St.  Gerald  (March  13)  and  one  of  the  four  sons of  an  Anglo-Saxon  king.  He  and  his  brothers, after  accompanying  St.  Colman  of  Lindisfarne to  Iona,  retired  into  Connaught  in  Ireland, at  Teehsaxon,  "  the  House  of  the  Saxons,"  in the  Diocese  of  Tuam.

He  died,  famous  for sanctity  and  miracle?.,  A.D.  756.  Under  King Canute,  his  body,  with  that  of  St.  Bilfrid,  was translated  to  Durham.  Some  identify  St. Balther  with  St.  Baldred  of  Scotland.

♦BANDARIDUS (BANDERIK, BANDERY)

At  length, Clothaire  discovered  his  place  of  refuge,  and recalled  him  to  his  See  (a.d.  554).  He  died a.d.  666,  and  was  buried  in  the  Abbey  of St.  Crispin,  which  he  had  founded.

He  died some  years  later,  about  a.d.  460. *BARAT  (MADELEINE)  V.  (25  May)

(3rd  cent.)  A  popular  Saint,  both  in  the Eastern  and  in  the  Western  Church.  She  is looked  upon  as  the  Patron  Saint  of  certain dangerous  crafts  and  professions,  such  as  those of  firework  makers,  artillerymen,  &c.  There is  no  reliable  account  extant  of  her  life  and martyrdom.  Some  authors  contend  that  she suffered  at  Nicomedia  in  Asia  Minor  under  the Emperor  Maximian  1,  about  a.d.  235 ;  while others  have  it  that  she  was  a  victim  like  so many  thousands  of  other  Christians  of  the  savage cruelty of Galerius, colleague of Diocletian, 
38 

and  that  she  was  done  to  death  at  Heliopolis in  Egypt  as  late  as  A.D.  306. *BARBASCEMINUS  and  OTHERS  (Jan.  14)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Barbasceminus,  Bishop  of Seleucia,  was  one  of  the  most  distinguished  of the  Persian  Martyrs  of  the  fourth  century  under the  persecuting  King  Sapor  II.  The  contemporary writer,  St.  Maruthas,  has  left  us  a vivid  account  of  his  sufferings  and  of  those who  with  him  gave  their  lives  for  Christ. BARBATIAN  (St.)  Conf.  (Dec.  31; 
(5th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Antioch  who  came  to Rome  and  there  attracted  the  attention  of Placidia  Augusta,  mother  of  the  Emperor Valentinian  III.  She  induced  him  to  attend her  to  her  residence  at  Ravenna,  where  she built  him  a  church  and  monastery.  By  his wise  and  moderate  counsels  he  rendered  great services  to  the  State.  The  precise  year  of  his death  is  uncertain. BARBATUS  (BARBAS)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  19)  
(7th  cent.)  A  citizen  of  Benevento  in  the South  of  Italy.  He  rendered  great  services to  his  native  town,  especially  when  besieged by  the  Emperor  Constans  of  Byzantium.

BARBE  (St.)  V.M.  (Dec,  4)

(2nd  cent.)  A  Syrian  woman  converted  to the  Faith  by  St.  Barsimeus,  Bishop  of  Edessa. She  was  scourged  and  then  speared  to  death  at Edessa,  some  time  during  the  reign  of  the Emperor  Trajan,  that  is,  before  a.d.  117. *BARDO  (St.)  Bp.  (June  10)  
(11th  cent.)  A  monk  of  Fulda,  consecrated Bishop  of  Mayence  (a.d.  1031).  He  was distinguished  not  only  for  austerity  of  life  and for  pastoral  zeal,  but  for  self-sacrificing  charity to  the  poor.  He  had  from  God  many  supernatural gifts,  and  in  particular  that  of  prophecy. He  died  on  the  day  he  had  publicly  foretold, June  11,  a.d.  1051. BARDOMIANUS,  EUCARPUS,  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  28)  
(Date uncertain.) These Martyrs, twentyeight  in  all,  suffered  together  in  Asia  Minor  in one  of  the  early  persecutions.  But  all  details have  been  lost. *BARHADBESCIALAS  (St.)  M.  (July  21)  
(4th  cent.) A  deacon  martyred  at  Arbela  in Adiabene  under  the  Persian  tyrant,  Sapor  II, about  a.d.  854.  His  Acts,  written  in  the  Aramaic language,  are  still  extant. BARLAAM  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  19)  
(4th  cent.)  A  pious  peasant,  who  bravely endured  imprisonment  and  torture  for  the Faith  at  Antioch  during  the  persecution  under Diocletian  and  Galerius  (a.d.  304).  Among  the works  of  St.  Basil  there  is  a  panegyric  preached on  the  festival  day  of  St.  Barlaam. BARLAAM  and  JOSAPHAT  (SS.)  Conf. (Nov.  27)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Barlaam,  a  monk  or  solitary in  Northern  India,  converted  to  the  Christian Faith,  Josaphat,  son  of  the  king  of  the  country, who,  like  Barlaam,  is  held  in  great  veneration in  the  East.  St.  Barlaam  worked  many miracles,  and  the  hermit's  cell  in  which  he passed  the  last  thirtyfive  years  of  his  life became  a  place  of  pilgrimage.  Both  Saints are  honoured  as  Martyrs,  and  are  said  to  have suffered  in  the  year  383.  But  even  the  century in  which  they  flourished  is  uncertain.  A panegyric  of  St.  Barlaam  is  attributed  to  St. John  Damascene,  and  a  foolish  mistake  has placed  some  of  the  legendary  doings  of  Buddha to  the  credit  of  the  Saint. BARNABAS  (St.)  Apostle.  (June  11)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  seventy-two  disciples of  our  Lord  (Luke  x.),  though  not  of  the  Twelve. Bom  in  Cyprus  and  styled  an  Apostle  by  St. 
BASIL 

Luke  and  by  the  Church  following  the  early Fathers,  he  is  mentioned  repeatedly  in  the Acts  of  the  Apostles.  He  laboured  with  St. Paul  at  Aotioch,  Seleucia,  Paphos,  &c,  and  is believed  to  have  been  stoned  to  death  in  his native  island  by  the  Jews,  exasperated  at  the success  of  his  preaching  of  the  Gospel.  St. Charles  Borromeo  proposed  him  as  the  Apostle of  Milan,  whither  a  tradition  avers  that  he came  in  the  course  of  his  missionary  career. It  is  alleged  that  several  centuries  after  his death,  on  his  tomb  being  opened,  his  body was  discovered,  holding  in  its  hands  a  copy  or the  original  Gospel  of  St.  Matthew,  written  in Hebrew.

A  tradition avers  that  he  reached  America  in  one  of his  missions  by  sea,  and  informed  St.  Brendan, the  Navigator,  of  his  discovery.  Some  Irish Calendars  style  him  a  Bishop.

Tradition tells  us  that  he  preached  the  Gospel  after  the Ascension  in  NorthWest  India,  and  afterwards in  Asia  Minor,  and  that  in  the  end  he  suffered martyrdom  in  Greater  Armenia.  Some  say that  he  was  crucified,  others  that  he  was  flayed alive.

♦BARYPSEBAS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  10)  
(1st  cent.)  A  pious  hermit  in  the  East  who, according  to  the  Greek  legend,  acquired  a  vessel containing  a  part  of  the  Sacred  Blood  which had  flowed  from  the  pierced  side  of  Our  Lord on  the  Cross,  and  conveyed  it  to  Europe.  He  is averred  to  have  suffered  martyrdom  in  Dalmatia. BASIL  and  PROCOPIUS  (SS.)  Conf.  (Feb.  27)

JETHERJUS, CAPITO, EPHREM, NESTOR 
and  ARCADIUS  (SS.)  Bps.,  MM.  (March  4)  
(4th  cent.)  These  nine  holy  pastors  of  souls flourished  at  the  end  of  the  third  and  beginning of  the  fourth  centuries.  Seven  of  them  were sent  as  missionary  Bishops  to  the  Crimea  and south  of  Russia ;  but  Nestor  and  Arcadius had  their  Sees  in  the  Island  of  Cyprus.  All alike  are  honoured  as  Martyrs  by  the  Greeks  on March  7,  and  by  the  Latin?  on  March  4,  though it  is  doubtful  if  either  Nestor  or  Arcadius perished  at  the  hands  of  the  enemies  of  the Faith. BASIL  (St.)  Bp.  (March  6)  
(4th  cent.) Consecrated  Bishop  of  Bologna 
by  Pope  St.  Sylvester.  He  ruled  his  Diocese

BASIL  (St.)  M.  (March  22)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Ancyra  in  Galatia (Asia  Minor),  a  victim  of  the  persecution  of Christians  set  on  foot  by  Julian  the  Apostate (A.D.  364).  He  was  put  to  the  torture  at Constantinople  (where  under  the  Arian  Emperor Constantius  lie  had  distinguished  himself  by his  zeal  in  preaching  against  heretics),  and  was afterwards  thrown  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the  arena at  Caesarea  in  Palestine. BASIL  and  EMMELIA  (SS.)  (May  30)  
(4th  cent.)  This  St.  Basil,  son  of  St.  Macrina the  Elder,  and  St.  Emmelia  his  wife,  were  the parents  of  St.  Basil  the  Great,  of  St.  Gregory Nyssen,  of  St.  Peter  of  Sebaste,  and  of  St. Macrina  the  Younger.  Exiled  as  a  Christian with  his  wife  in  the  time  of  the  persecuting Emperor  Galerius  Maximianus,  he  returned after  the  peace  of  the  Church  to  his  native

BASIL 
city  of  Caesarea  in  Cappadocia,  and  lived  to a  great  age.  He  died  some  time  before  a.d.  370. St.  Gregory  Nazianzen,  the  friend  of  his  children, styles  him  "  the  instructor  of  all  men  in  Christian virtue." BASIL THE GBEAT (St.) Bp.,  (June  14)  

Doctor  of  the  Church.  

(4th  cent.)  St.  Basil,  surnamed  the  Great, one  of  the  most  celebrated  of  the  Greek  Fathers, came  of  a  family  of  Saints,  the  best  known  of whom  are  his  brother,  St.  Gregory  Nyssen,  and Ms  sister,  St.  Macrina.  Born  at  Caesarea  in Cappadocia  (Asia  Minor)  he  early  distinguished himself  as  a  student  at  Constantinople  and  at Athens,  in  which  last  city  he  contracted  a  close friendship  with  St.  Gregory  Nazianzen,  destined like  him  to  become  a  Bishop  and  Doctor  of  the Church.  St.  Basil  was  consecrated  Bishop  of Caesarea  on  June  14,  A.D.  370,  and  died  Jan.  1, A.D.  379.  He  is  famous  for  his  defence  before the  Emperor  Constantius  of  the  Catholic  Faith, and  in  particular  of  the  word  "  Consubstantial," inserted  in  the  Nicene  Creed.  He  has  left many  writings,  among  them  his  Hexaemeron or  Treatise  on  Genesis,  several  hundred  letters and  a  series  of  Homilies.  St.  Gregory  Nazianzen allots  to  him  the  first  place  among  commentators on  the  Bible,  and  the  great  scholar  Erasmus declares  St.  Basil  to  have  been  the  finest  orator of  all  time.  St.  Basil  led  the  life  of  a  monk, and  wrote  a  Rule  for  his  brethren  still  followed in  the  East.  In  art  St.  Basil  is  represented  as standing  near  a  fire  with  a  dove  perched  on  his arm.  His  Encomium,  by  his  brother,  St. Gregory  Nyssen,  and  his  Life  by  Amphilochius, are  among  religious  classics.  Cardinal  Newman's Life  of  St.  Basil  should  also  be  read.

See  SS.  JOVINUS  and  BASILEUS. BASILEUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  26)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Amasea  in  Pontus (Asia  Minor),  cast  into  the  sea  by  order  of  the Emperor  Licinius  (a.d.  319).

See  SS.  EPITACIUS  and  BASILEUS. BASILEUS,  AUXILIUS  and  SATURNINUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  27)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  holy  Bishop  Basileus, the  name  of  whose  See  has  not  reached  our  times, suffered  martyrdom  at  Antioch  in  Syria,  together with  two  other  Christians,  Auxilius  and Saturninus ;  but  dates  and  particulars  are altogether  wanting.  We  have  only  the  entries in  the  Martyrologies  and  ancient  lists  of  Martyrs to  guide  us. BASILIAN  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  18)  

See  SS.  THEOTIMUS  and  BASILIAN. BASILIDES, TRIPOS, MANDAL and OTHERS 
(SS.).  (June  10)  
(3rd  cent.)  Twenty-three  Christians,  martyred outside  the  walls  of  Borne,  on  the  Aurelian Way,  under  the  Emperor  Aurelian  (A.D.  270A.D.  275).  There  is  much  uncertainty  about these  Saints.  Some  authorities  (among  them the  Bollandists)  think  this  Basilides  to  be  identical with  the  better  known  Basilides  of  June  12, who  also  was  martyred  on  the  Aurelian  Way. BASILIDES,  CYRINUS,  NABOR  and  NAZARIUS 
(SS.)MM.  (June  12)  
(4th  cent.)  Celebrated  Boman  Martyrs, put  to  death  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  304).  They are  described  as  soldiers  (perhaps  officers)  of noble  birth  in  the  Imperial  army.  They  were buried  in  the  Aurelian  Way,  near  the  place  of their  martyrdom. BASILIDES  (St.)  M.  (June  30)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  soldier  of  the  Guard  of  the Prefect  of  Egypt.  He  defended  St.  Potamia from  insult,  and  in  so  doing  won  the  gift  of Faith  and  the  crown  of  martyrdom  at  Alexan
40 

dria,  in  the  time  of  the  Emperor  Septimus Severus  (A.D.  205).  

BASILIDES  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  23)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  layman  of  Cydonia in  Crete.  In  the  persecution  under  the  Emperor Decius  (a.d.  250)  he  was  beheaded  with  St. Theodulus  and  eight  others.  Their  relics  are in  Bome,  and  they  are  known  as  the  "  Ten Martyrs  of  Crete." 
BASILICUS  (BASILISCUS)  (St.)  M.  (March  3)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  soldier  crucified  at 
Comana  in  Pontus  (Asia  Minor),  with  two  of  his 
comrades,  Eutropius  and  Clement,  during  the 
persecution  under  Maximian  Galerius  (a.d.  308).  

BASILICUS  (St.)  M.  (May  22)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Comana  in  Pontus (Asia  Minor),  who  was  beheaded  and  his  body thrown  into  a  river  near  Nicomedia  (a.d.  312), under  the  Emperor  Maximin  Daza.  The  Greeks honour  him  on  July  30.  This  was  the  holy Martyr  who,  appearing  to  St.  John  Chrysostom, intimated  to  him  that  on  the  morrow  that Saint'3  work  for  God  on  earth  would  end.  

BASILISSA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  The  wife  of  St.  Julian  the  Martyr with  whom  she  is  commemorated.  They  were Syrians  of  Antioch,  and  had  agreed  on  taking a  vow  of  perpetual  chastity,  to  be  observed, even  though  married.  This  vow  they  faithfully kept.  St.  Basilissa  died  a  natural  death  ; but  has  been  honoured  as  a  Martyr  both  on account  of  her  own  sufferings  for  the  Faith  and because  of  her  being  commemorated  in  one festival  with  St.  Julian,  whom  she  encouraged to  offer  the  sacrifice  of  his  life  during  the persecution  under  Diocletian,  in  the  first  years of  the  fourth  centurv.  

BASILISSA  (St.)  V.M.  (March  22)  
(3rd  or  4th  cent.)  A  young  girl,  a  Christian, burned  alive  with  St.  Callinica,  at  Antioch, under  Diocletian  (a.d.  305;,  or,  as  others  say, with  greater  probability,  in  Galatia,  under Decius  (A.D.  250).  

BASILISSA  and  ANASTASIA  (SS.)  MM.  (April  15) (1st  cent.)  Noble  Boman  ladies,  who  were among  the  first  converts  in  the  metropolis  of the  Empire  to  Christianity.  They  are  said  to have  given  honourable  burial  to  the  bodies  of the  Apostles  SS.  Peter  and  Paul,  and  on  that account  to  have  themselves  perished  in  the massacre  of  Christians  instigated  and  carried out  bv  the  Emperor  Nero  (a.d.  68).  

♦BASINOS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  4)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Abbot  of  Treves,  afterwards Bishop  of  that  city,  very  much  against  his  own will.  He  was  a  friend  and  helper  of  the  English missionaries  to  Germany.  His  death  took  place before  a.d.  680.  

BASILISSA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  3)  
(4th  cent.)  A  child  of  nine  years  of  age  who was  martyred  at  Nicomedia,  the  Imperial residence,  during  the  persecution  under  Diocletian, about  a.d.  303.  As  she  was  being  led to  execution,  one  of  the  officials,  by  name Alexander,  is  said  to  have  tlirown  himself  at  her feet,  declaring  his  belief  in  Christ,  and  to  have been  forthwith  baptised  by  the  little  Martyr.  

BASILLA  (St.)  M.  (May  17)  

See  SS.  ADRIO,  VICTOR, &c.  

BASILLA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  20)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  maiden  of  noble  lineage, one  of  the  victims  of  the  persecution  under Valerian  and  Gallienus  (a.d.  257).  The  Acts of  her  martyrdom  are  not,  however,  such  as  to merit  credit  in  regard  to  details.  Her  relics discovered  in  the  seventeenth  century,  have been  translated  to  Brittany.  Possibly,  this St.  Basilla  is  identical  with  the  St.  Babilla  also commemorated  on  May  20,  of  whom  the  Roman Martyrology  makes  no  mention.  

BASILLA  (St.)  (Aug.  29)  
(Date  unknown.) A holy woman  who, 
according  to  the  Roman  Martyrology,  died  at 
Smyrna.  Other Martyrologies substitute for 
Smyrna,  Sirmium  in  Pannonia  (now  Mitrowicz, 
BEATRICE 

in the Balkans). Unfortunately, dates and particulars  are  wanting.  

BASOLUS  (St.)  (Nov.  26)  
(7th  cent.)  A  famous  hermit,  born  at Limoges  (France),  who  entered  a  monastery near  Rheims,  but  later  retired  to  a  hut  on  the top  of  a  neighbouring  hill,  where  he  died  and was  buried,  a.d.  620,  after  by  prayer  and  fasting overcoming  many  assaults  of  the  evil  one. Later  his  monastery  was  rebuilt  over  his  tomb, and  his  relics  enshrined  in  it,  a.d.  879.  

BASSA  (St.)  M.  (March  6)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  woman,  martyred  at Corinth,  or  as  others  say.  at  Nicomedia.  With her  suffered  her  husband,  Claudianus,  and  other two,  Victor  and  Victorinus.  It  is  added  that Bassa  had  been  three  years  in  prison  before being  put  to  the  torture  and  executed.  There  is great  uncertainty  as  to  the  date  of  their  martyrdom ;  and  some  opinions  are  to  the  effect  that this  was  a  group  of  Syrian  Saints  who  suffered in  their  own  country.  Perhaps  this  St.  Bassa is  no  other  than  the  Martyr  of  that  name commemorated  on  Aug.  21.  

BASSA,  PAULA  and  AGATHONICA (Aug.  10) (SS.)  VV.  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  Three  Christian  maidens registered  in  the  accepted  lists  as  having  given their  lives  for  Christ  at  Carthage.  

BASSA,  THEOGONIUS,  AGAPIUS  and  FIDELIS (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  21)  
(4th  cent.)  Bassa  was  a  devout  Christian woman,  wife  of  a  Pagan  priest,  who,  with  her three  sons,  suffered  death  for  her  Christian Faith  at  Edessa  in  Syria,  under  one  of  Diocletian's colleagues,  about  a.d.  304.  She  suffered the  last  of  the  four,  having  herself  encouraged her  children  bravely  to  die  for  Christ, and  been  a  witness  of  their  triumph.  

BASSIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  19)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Sicilian  by  birth,  Bishop  of Lodi  in  Lombardy,  and  mentioned  with  high praise  by  his  friend,  St.  Ambrose  of  Milan,  with whom  he  had  attended  the  Council  of  Aquileia (a.d.  381).  St.  Bassian  died  a.d.  413,  and  was buried  in  the  Church  which  he  had  dedicated in  honour  of  the  holy  Apostles  at  Lodi,  of  which city  he  is  the  Patron  Saint.

BASSUS,  ANTONIUS  and  PROTOLICUS  (Feb.  14) (SS.)  MM.  

(Date  uncertain.)  All  the  ancient  Martyrologies  make  mention  on  Feb.  14  of  these Saints,  and  describe  them  as  having  been  cast into  the  sea  at  Alexandria  in  Egypt,  on  account of  their  Faith.  Some  MSS.  add  the  names  of nine  fellow-sufferers  with  them,  but  all  particulars have  long  since  been  lost.  

BASSUS  (St.)  M.  (May  11)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  Christian  who  suffered martyrdom  on  the  Via  Salaria,  outside  the  walls  of Rome,  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  304).  With  him  SS. Maximus  and  Fabius  won  their  heavenly  crown. Besides  the  Martyrologies,  the  Acts  of  St.  Anthimus  the  Martyr  make  mention  of  this  St.  Bassus.  

BASSUS,  DIONYSIUS,  AGAPITUS  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  20)  
(Date uncertain.) A band of forty-three 
Christians  put  to  death  for  their  religion  at 
Heraclea  in  Thrace.  No  particulars  can  now 
be  found.  

BASSUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Dec.  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Nice  in  the  middle of  the  third  century.  Tortured  by  the  President Perennius,  under  the  Emperors  Decius  and Valerian,  he  at  length  was  put  to  death  about a.d.  257  by  having  his  body  transfixed  by  two huge  nails  or  spikes.  

BATHILDE  (St.)  Widow.  (Jan.  26)  
(7th  cent.) An  accredited  tradition  tells  us 
that  she  was  an  Anglo-Saxon  princess  or  lady 
of  high  degree  who,  carried  off  from  her  native 

shores,  became  a  slave  in  the  family  of  the Mayor  of  the  Palace,  the  highest  official  of  the Frankish  Merovingian  Court.  Espoused  by King  Clovis  II,  she  became  the  mother  of  his successors,  Clothaire  III,  Childeric  II,  and Thierry  III,  and  on  the  death  of  her  husband was  made  Regent  of  his  kingdom.  She  refounded  St.  Clotilde's  Abbey  of  Chelles,  whither she  retired  when  no  longer  required  to  govern for  her  sons,  and  where  she  died  A.D.  680. Generous  and  kind  to  all,  she  was  a  veritable mother  to  the  poor.  On  her  deathbed  a  vision of  Angels  summoned  her  to  mount  by  a  shining ladder  to  Paradise.  Artists  represent  her  in  a nun's  habit,  but  wearing  a  Royal  crown.  

BAUDELIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  20)  
(2nd  or  3rd  cent.)  A  married  layman,  born at  Orleans,  who  laboured  in  the  propagation  of Cliristianity  in  Gaul  and  in  the  end  was  put  to death  on  that  account  by  the  persecuting Roman  authorities  at  Nimes  in  the  south  of France.  As  in  many  similar  cases  of  Saints engaged  in  the  conversion  of  France,  there  is no  agreement  among  the  learned  as  to  the  date of  his  Apostolate.  Some  hold  that  he  was beheaded  in  the  year  187  ;  others  place  him more  than  a  century  later,  and  date  his  martyrdom in  295.  He  has  always  been  in  great popular  veneration.  Some  four  hundred churches  in  France  and  Spain  have  been  dedicated in  his  honour.  

BAVO  (St.)  Conf.  (Oct.  1)  
(7th  cent.)  A  nobleman  of  the  district  of Liege,  who  led  an  irregular  life,  but  on  the death  of  his  wife  became  a  devout  penitent. Retiring  to  a  cell  in  a  forest,  he  gave  himself up  to  prayer  and  died  there  (a.d.  654).  He  is the  Patron  Saint  of  Ghent  and  of  Haerlem.  

♦BATHUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM. (March  26)  
(4th cent.) A  family  consisting  of  father, 
mother,  two  sons  and  two  daughters,  put  to 
death  as  Christians,  somewhere  in  the  Balkans

♦BAYA  and  MAURA  (SS.)  VV.  (Nov.  2)  
(10th  cent.)  Two  holy  Recluses  in  Scotland, St.  Baya  being  the  instructress  of  St.  Maura, and  the  latter  becoming  the  guide  of  a  fervent community  which  attached  itself  to  her.  There is  some  doubt  whether  or  not  St.  Baya  may not  be  identical  with  St.  Begha  or  St.  Bee,  a Saint  much  better  known.  

♦BEANDAN  (BREANDAN)  (St.)  Abbot  (Jan.  11) (5th  cent.)  A  native  of  Ireland  who  crossed into  Britain.  There  he  suffered  persecution  at the  hands  of  the  Pelagian  heretics,  whose  errors had  become  in  his  time  widespread  in  the island.  Constrained  to  leave  the  country,  he took  refuge  in  Gaul,  and  entered  a  monastery of  which  he  later  became  the  Abbot.  Further particulars  concerning  him  are  lacking.  

BEAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  16)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Scottish  Saint,  Bishop  of Murtlach  in  Banff,  from  which  See  he  was later  transferred  to  Aberdeen.  He  is  said  to have  been  appointed  to  Aberdeen  by  Pope Benedict  VIII  about  A.d.  1012.  

Another  St.  Bean,  also  commemorated  on Dec.  16,  was  an  Irish  Bishop  in  Leinster.  The Feast  of  St.  Bean  of  Murtlach  is  more  properly kept  on  Oct.  26,  as  in  the  old  Aberdeen  Breviary and  the  present  Scottish  Calendar.

See  SS.  CYRIL  ROGATUS, &c.  

♦BEATRICE  of  ESTE  (Bl.)  V.  (Jan.  18)  
(13th  cent.)  An  Italian  princess  who,  on  the eve  of  her  wedding-day,  on  receiving  the  news of  the  death  in  battle  of  her  affianced  husband, resolved  on  giving  herself  entirely  to  God,  and founded  a  monastery  near  Ferrara,  which  she governed  for  many  years,  and  where  she  passed away,  a.d.  1270.  An  aunt  of  this  Saint,  also by  name  Beatrice,  like  her,  attained  to  the honours  of  the  Altar.

BEATRICE 

THE  BOOK  OP  SAINTS 

BEATRICE  (St.)  M.  (July  29)  
(4th  cent.)  Her  brothers,  SS.  Siraplicius  and Faustinus,  were  victims  of  the  persecution  under Diocletian  (a.d.  304)  and  their  bodies  were thrown  into  the  Tiber.  Beatrice,  having  recovered their  remains  and  honourably  buried them,  went  to  live  with  St.  Lucina,  a  noble Christian  lady.  Later,  Beatrice  was  herself arrested  as  a  Christian  and  strangled  in  prison.
♦BEATUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  8)  

Otherwise  St.  BEOADH,  which  see. BEATUS  (St.)  Conf.  (May  9)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  native  of  Italy,  he  evangelised several  parts  of  France,  especially  the  neighbourhood of  Laon,  where  be  chose  a  cave  for his  hermitage  and  passed  in  prayer  and  meditation all  the  time  which  he  did  not  spend  in missionary  work.  He  died  at  an  advanced age  towards  the  end  of  the  third  century.  

Another  account,  adopted  by  Baronms  and other  authorities,  relates  that  he  passed  the closing  year  of  his  life  in  Western  France,  and was  there  interred.  Again,  some  writers  postdate St.  Beatus  to  the  fifth  century.  But  it seems  clear  that  the  St.  Beatus  of  Vendome  is other  than  the  holy  man  who  evangelised  Laon, though  the  Roman  Martyrology  treats  the  two Saints  as  cne  and  the  same  person.  
♦BECAN  (BEGAN)  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  5)  
(6th  cent.)  A  distinguished  Irish  Saint connected  with  St.  Columbkille.  He  founded a  monastery  at  Kil-Beggan  (West  Meath), later  a  Cistercian  Abbey  of  importance.  He also  gave  its  name  to  the  church  and  parish of  Emlagh  (Meath).  He  is  reckoned  as  one of  the  "  Twelve  Apostles  of  Ireland."
♦BECAN  (St.)  Conf.  (May  26)  
(6th  cent.) An  Irish  hermit  in  the  time  of 
St.  Columbkille.  He  lived  in  the  neighbourhood 
of  Cork  and  acquired  great  fame  on  account  of 
the  austerity  of  his  life.  

♦BECHE  (JOHN)  (Bl.)  M.  (Dec.  1)  

See  Bl.  JOHN  BECHE.
♦BEDE  THE  YOUNGER  (St.)  Conf. (April  10)  
(9th  cent.)  A  noble  of  high  rank  at  the Court  of  King  Charles  the  Bald  of  France,  who left  the  world  to  serve  God  in  a  monastery near  Rovigo  in  the  North  of  Italy.  Over  and over  again  he  refused  Ecclesiastical  preferment, and  passed  away  in  great  fame  of  sanctity, a.d.  883.  His  relics,  enshrined  at  Genoa,  were about  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century translated  to  the  Benedictine  Abbey  of  Subiaco. BEDE  (VENERABLE)  (St.)  Doctor  (May  27)  

of  the  Church.  

(8th  cent.)  The  Venerable  Bede,  styled  by Leland  "  the  chief  est  and  brightest  ornament of  the  English  nation,"  born  a.d.  673,  was  a Northumbrian.  He  was  educated  at  Jarrow, where  he  embraced  the  monastic  life  under St.  Benet  Biscop,  and  was  ordained  priest  by St.  John  of  Beverley.  Well  versed  in  the Latin  and  Greek  languages,  and  for  his  time  a fair  poet,  he  has  left  prose  works  on  the  most varied  subjects,  ranging  from  clever  expositions of  the  science  of  his  day  to  noble  commentaries on  Holy  Scripture.  His  Church  History  of the  English  has  earned  him  the  title  of  "  Father of  English  History."  It  is  a  plain  unadorned chronicle  ;  but  that  the  author  was  thoroughly honest  and  most  painstaking  is  evident  to  any reader.  St.  Bede  was  famous  not  only  for  his rare  learning,  but  still  more  so  for  the  holiness of  his  life.  The  account  of  his  death  (a.d.  735), which  took  place  on  Ascension  Eve,  written  by one  of  his  pupils,  is  touching  in  its  loving simplicity.  Bede's  last  words  were  "  Gloria Patri  et  Filio  et  Spiritni  Sancto." 
Trithemius  supposed  that  the  prefix  "  Venerable," universally  given  to  St.  Bede,  came  from the  circumstance  that  his  Homilies  were  read  in churches  during  his  lifetime,  as  the  most  respectful appellation  of  one  who  had  no  claim as  yet  to  the  title  of  Saint ;  but  it  is  now generally  accepted  that  it  was  first  used  by 
42 

Amalarius and other ninth century writers long  after  St.  Bede  had  acquired  the  honours due to a Saint.  St. Bede's remains were enshrined  in  Durham  Cathedral. *BEE  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  31)  

Otherwise  St.  BEGH  or  BEGA,  which  see. BEGGA  (St.)  Widow.  (Dec.  17)  
(7th  cent.)  A  daughter  of  Pepin  of  Landen, mayor  of  the  palace  in  the  Merovingian  Court, sister  of  St.  Gertrude  of  Nivelle  and  grandmother of  Charles  Martel.  On  the  death  of  her  husband she  made  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome,  and  returning to  her  own  country  gave  herself  up  to  good works.  She  is  said  to  have  founded  seven churches,  besides  a  convent  near  Namur,  in which  she  died,  a.d.  698. *BEGH  (BEGA,  BEE)  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  6)  
(7th  cent.)  A  holy  maiden  born  in  Ireland, who  crossed  over  to  Cumberland,  where  the promontory,  St.  Bee's  Head,  still  perpetuates her  memory,  as  does  the  name  of  the  village Kilbees  in  Scotland.  She  received  the  religious veil  from  St.  Aidan,  and  founded  a  monastery at  Copeland,  near  Whitehaven.  Distinguished in  life  for  charity  to  the  poor,  for  centuries after  her  death  she  was  in  the  greatest  veneration in  the  north-west  of  England,  and  her fame  spread  as  far  as  Norway.  There  were several  Saints  of  the  same  period  with  histories not  unlike  that  of  St.  Bee.  She  may  possibly be  the  virgin  Hieu,  mentioned  by  Venerable Bede.  Baring-Gould  distinguishes  three  St. Bees ;  the  first,  the  Irish  Saint  mentioned above ;  the  second  a  nun  in  Yorkshire  ;  and the  third  the  Abbess  of  Kilbees. *BELINA  (St.)  V.M.  (Feb.  19)  
(12th  cent.) A  peasant  girl  of  the  neighbourhood of  Troyes  (France),  who  died  in  defence of  her  chastity,  threatened  by  the  feudal  lord of  the  territory  (A.D.  1135). BELLINUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  26)  
(12th  cent.) A  Bishop  of  Padua,  who  suffered 
death  in  the  faithful  discharge  of  his  pastoral 
duties  in  the  year  1151,  and  was  canonised  three 
centuries  later  by  Pope  Eugene  IV.  

BENEDICTA  (St.;  V.M.  (Jan.  4)  
(4th  cent.)  A  nun  or  "religious  woman," 
beheaded  in  the  time  of  Julian  the  Apostate 
(a.d.  364). Fellow-sufferers  with  her  in  Rome 
were  Priscus,  a  priest,  and  Priscillian,  a  cleric.  

BENEDICTA  (St.)  V.  (May  6)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  nun  of  marvellously ascetic  life,  an  inmate  of  the  convent  founded  in Rome  by  St.  Galla,  of  whom  St.  Gregory  the Great  narrates  that  her  death  was  foretold  by St.  Peter,  seen  in  a  vision. BENEDICTA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  29)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyred  at  Sens  in  France under  the  Emperor  Aurelian  (a.d.  273).  Her brother,  St.  Sanctian,  and  another  Martyr,  a St.  Augustine,  were  beheaded  at  the  same  time. They  are  said  to  have  all  been  natives  of  Spain, whence  they  had  passed  into  France.  Surius, with  others,  refuses  to  accept  tins  account  of St.  Benedicta,  nor  does  the  Roman  Martyrology number  her  among  the  Martyrs.  According  to the  moderns,  the  St.  Benedicta  (or  St.  Beata) venerated  at  Sens  was  in  all  likelihood  a  holy nun  of  the  locality,  though  it  is  possible  that there  may  have  been  there  an  earlier  Saint  of the  same  name. BENEDICTA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  8)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  daughter  of  a  Roman senator  who,  inspired  with  a  desire  for  martyrdom by  what  she  had  heard  of  the  triumph  of St.  Quentin,  settled  at  Origny-sur-Oise  in  the Diocese  of  Soissons,  where  she  was  instrumental in  propagating  Christianity.  Mathoclus,  her father,  enraged  at  her  miraculous  recovery from  the  many  tortures  he  had  had  inflicted upon  her,  is  said  himself  to  have  seized  the executioner's  axe  and  to  have  beheaded  her with  his  own  hands  (A.D.  262). BENEDICT  BISCOP  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  12)  
(7th  cent.) A  Northumbrian  of  noble  birth 
BENEDICT 

who,  after  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome,  embraced  the monastic  life  in  the  Isle  of  Lerins  (an  island  off the  Mediterranean  coast  of  France).  When again  in  Borne,  Fope  St.  Vitalian  ordered  him to  conduct  back  to  England  St.  Theodore,  Just made  Archbishop  of  Canterbury.  On  their arrival  he  himself  was  appointed  Abbot  of  St. Augustine's  monastery  at  Canterbury.  Other visits  to  Rome  followed,  and  in  the  end  North  umbria  became  the  scene  of  St.  Benedict's labours  for  the  good  of  souls.  There  he  founded the  monasteries  of  Wearmouth  and  of  Jarrow. He  died  Jan.  12,  A.D.  690.  He  is,  above  all, celebrated  for  his  learning  and  for  his  zeal  in reforming  English  Church  discipline  in  conformity with  that  obtaining  in  Rome  and  in general  in  the  West.  

♦BENEDICT  of  ANIANA  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  11) (9th  cent.)  Born  in  Languedoc  in  the  eighth century,  he  has  been  styled  "  the  second Benedict  "  and  "  the  second  father  of  monasticism  in  the  West."  He  laboured  all  his lifelong  for  the  good  of  the  Church,  especially in  France.  Leaving  the  Court  of  Charlemagne, he  entered  the  monastery  of  St.  Seine  in  a  forest of  Burgundy ;  but  on  being  chosen  Abbot there,  fled  to  his  native  province  and  built himself  a  cell  in  the  gorge  of  the  stream  Aniane (Corbieres,  where  afterwards  arose  the  famous Abbey  of  St.  Sauveivr).  Later  he  passed  to the  neighbourhood  of  Aix-la-Chapelle,  where, on  the  banks  of  the  river  Inde,  the  Emperor Louis  le  Debonnaire  built  for  him  the  great Abbey  known  as  Cornelius-Munster.  He  attended the  Councils  of  Aries  (A.D.  813)  and  of Aix-la-Chapelle  (A.D.  817),  over  the  latter  of which  he  presided.  He  died  and  was  buried  at Inde  (a.d.  821).  His  writings  comprise  a  Code of  Monastic  Rules,  some  Homilies  and  a  Penitential. In  art,  he  is  often  represented  in  the act  of  clothing  St.  William  of  Aquitaine  with the  monastic  habit.  

BENEDICT  (St.)  Bp.  (March  11)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Milan,  of  the family  of  the  Crespi,  famous  all  over  Italy  for his  sanctity,  pastoral  zeal  and  charity.  He delivered  the  funeral  discourse  of  Ceadwalla of  Wessex,  the  Anglo-Saxon  king  baptised in  the  year  687  by  Pope  Sergius  in  Rome.  He died  a.d.  725,  in  the  forty-fourth  year  of  his Episcopate.  

BENEDICT  (SI.)  Abbot.  (March  21)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Patriarch  of  the  Western monks,  born  at  Norcia  in  Central  Italy  (a.d. 480),  of  the  noble  family  of  the  Anicii.  In early  youth  he  retired  into  a  cave  in  the  mountains of  Subiaco  near  Rome,  where,  clothed with  the  religious  habit,  fed  and  instructed  by St.  Romanus,  a  Solitary  of  the  vicinity,  he  led a  hermit's  life.  After  three  years  of  solitude, he  built  at  Subiaco  twelve  monasteries  for  the numerous  disciples  that  had  gathered  round him.  In  the  year  529  he  left  Subiaco  for  Monte Cassino,  on  the  road  to  Naples,  and  there founded  the  great  Abbey  of  that  name,  an  event which  marked  in  some  sense  a  landmark  in  the history  of  religious  life  in  Europe.  St.  Gregory the  Great,  who  wrote  the  Life  of  St.  Benedict, mentions  also  a  monastery  of  nuns  presided over  by  the  Saint's  sister,  St.  Scholastica.  The Rule  written  by  St.  Benedict,  in  the  course  of a  hundred  years  or  so,  was  accepted  by  all  the Western  monks.  It  shows  the  way  to  religious perfection  by  the  practice  of  humility,  obedience, prayer,  silence  and  retirement  from  the concerns  of  the  world.  St.  Benedict  died (a.d.  543),  standing  before  the  Altar,  immediately after  having  received  Holy  Communion. In  art  he  is  represented  holding  a  book  on which  Is  a  serpent,  In  allusion  to  one  of  the miracles  he  wrought,  or  with  a  raven  at  his feet.  

BENEDICT  (St.)  (March  23)  
(6th  cent.) A  monk  of  Campania,  mentioned 
by  St.  Gregory  the  Great,  whom  the  Goths, 

under  Totila,  when  devastating  Italy,  tried  to burn  alive,  but  were  miraculously  prevented from  effecting  their  purpose  (a.d.  550).  This St.  Benedict  was  a  contemporary  of  the  great St.  Benedict  of  Nursia,  and  was  personally known  to  him. BENEDICT  (St.)  (April  3)  
(16th  cent.)  Surnamed  the  "  Black,"  or  the Negro.  He  was  born  (a.d.  1526)  of  negro  parents at  a  village  near  Messina  in  Sicily.  His father  and  mother  were  slaves ;  but  he  was made  a  freeman.  An  Order  of  Hermits  which he  had  joined  being  suppressed  by  Pope  Pius IV,  he  entered  a  convent  of  Franciscan  Friars at  Palermo,  and,  though  only  a  lay-brother, was,  on  account  of  his  eminent  holiness  of  life, elected  Guardian  or  Superior  and  Master  of Novices.  He  died  April  4,  1589,  and  many years  afterwards,  when  his  coffin  was  opened, his  remains  were  found  incorrupt.  He  was beatified  a.d.  1743,  and  canonised  A.D.  1807.  . BENEDICT  JOSEPH  LABRE  (St.)  (April  16)  
(18th  cent.)  The  son  of  poor  parents  of Amettes  In  Artois  (France),  he  first  purposed to  enter  Into  some  Religious  Order,  but  afterwards realised  that  his  call  from  God  was  to a  life  of  utter  solitude.  He  made  several pilgrimages,  visiting  the  sanctuaries  of  France, Italy,  Switzerland  and  Germany.  He  everywhere begged  his  food,  constantly  refusing money,  and  spent  his  time  in  almost  continuous prayer  before  the  Blessed  Sacrament.  He  died in  Rome  during  Holy  Week,  a.d.  1783.  He was  canonised  by  Pope  Plus  IX  In  1860, though  the  popular  veneration  of  the  poor mendicant  was  universal  in  Rome  long  before he  had  even  passed  from  this  world.  His  funeral cortege  resembled  a  triumphal  procession,  and up  to  our  own  time  his  shrine  Is  one  of  the  most frequented  In  Rome.  
♦BENEDICT  (BENET)  OF  THE  BRIDGE 
(St.)  (April  28)  
(12th  cent.) A  holy  man  of  Avignon,  locally 
venerated  as  having  been  aided  by  an  Angel 
to  construct  a  bridge  at  a  dangerous  ford  over 
the  river  Rhone.  He  died  a.d.  1184.  

BENEDICT  II  (St.)  Pope.  (May  7)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth,  who  in  early life,  devoted  himself  to  the  study  of  the  Holy Scriptures  and  of  the  Ecclesiastical  chant. On  the  death  of  St.  Leo  II  (a.d.  683)  he  was elected  Pope,  but  his  enthronement  was  delayed for  a  year  while  awaiting  the  confirmation  of  the Emperor  of  Constantinople,  up  to  that  time usually  sought.  It  was  mainly  on  account  of the  case  of  this  Pope  that  the  then  Emperor Constantine  Pogonatus  consented  that  thenceforth such  Imperial  approval  need  no  longer be  sought.  Pope  Benedict  died  A.d.  685,  and was  buried  in  St.  Peter's. BENEDICT  XI  (St.)  Pope.  (July  7)  
(14th  cent.)  Born  at  Treviso,  a.d.  1210, he  In  his  youth  joined  the  Dominican  Order,  of which  he  eventually  became  the  Master  General. Created  Cardinal  and  Bi«hop  of  Ostla,  he  was employed  by  Pope  Boniface  VIII  as  his  Nuncio and  peacemaker  in  England,  France,  Hungary, Poland,  Austria,  Denmark,  Servia  and  other countries.  Everywhere  he  conciliated  respect, and  acquired  fame  and  veneration  from  princes and  people  alike,  on  account  of  his  simple  piety and  spirit  of  self-sacrifice.  He  was,  moreover, a  man  of  first-rate  abilities,  and  well  versed  In the  learning  of  his  age.  He  was  elected  Pope, Oct.  21,  1303,  but  died  at  Perugia  in  the  July of  the  following  year.  In  the  few  months  of his  Pontificate  he  had  done  much  to  reform Church  discipline  and  to  repress  abuses.  Hence probably,  the  belief  current  at  the  time  that  he had  died  by  poison. BENEDICT  (St.)  (Oct.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  Described  as  Bishop  of  Samaria or  Sebaste  in  Palestine.  His  flock  was  dispersed by  Julian  the  Apostate.  St.  Hilary  of Poitiers received him and gave him land,

BENEDICT 
whereon  he  built  a  hermitage,  which  later became  the  Abbey  of  St.  Benedict  of  Quincay (a.d.  654).  His  relics,  hidden  in  the  fourteenth century  during  the  wars  between  France  and England,  were  never  afterwards  discovered. But  the  Bollandists  throw  doubts  on  the legendary  account  of  this  St.  Benedict,  certainly seriously  interpolated.  The  Church  commemorates him  as  a  Saint,  but  not  as  a  Bishop. BENEDICT,  JOHN,  ISAAC,  MATTHEW  and 
CHRISTINUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  12)  
(11th  cent.)  Holy  men  of  the  Order  of  the Camaldolese  Hermits,  who  followed  St.  Bruno (otherwise  St.  Boniface)  into  Russia  to  preach the  Gospel.  They  with  some  others  were  put to  death  by  the  Pagans  at  Gnesen  in  Poland (a.d.  1004),  and  were  canonised  many  centuries later  bv  Pope  Julius  II.
♦BENEDICTINE  MARTYRS  (BB.)  (Dec.  1)  

See  Bl.  RICHARD  WHITING,  HUGH FARINGDON,  JOHN  BECHE. *BENEZET  (St.)  Conf.  (April  14)  

Otherwise  St.  BENEDICT  OF  THE  BRIDGE, which  see. BENIGNUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  13)  
(4th  cent.) A  priest  of  Todi  in  Umbria  (Italy) who  was  tortured and  put  to  death  in  the persecution  under  Diocletian,  about  a.d.  303. BENIGNUS  (St.)  M.  (April  3)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Martyred  in  the  city  of Tomis  or  Tomois  on  the  Black  Sea,  near  the mouths  of  the  Danube.  His  name  is  joined with  that  of  a  Saint  Evagrius,  and  in  some MSS.  with  several  others. BENIGNUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  28)  
(6th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  Bishop  probably of  Chartres,  who  is  mentioned  in  a  Decretal  of Pope  Pelagius  II  as  desirous  of  resigning  Ins See.  He  appears  to  have  retired  afterwards to  Utrecht.  St.  Gregory  of  Tours,  his  contempory,  refers  to  an  apparition  of  the  Saint. His  relics  were  rediscovered  at  Utrecht,  A.D. 996. BENIGNUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  1)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Greek  of  Smyrna,  said  to  have been  sent  into  Gaul  by  St.  Poly  carp  and  to have  become  the  Apostle  of  Burgundy.  He planted  the  Faith  at  Autun  and  at  Langres, making  Dijon  the  centre  of  his  activity.  He was  tortured  and  put  to  death  in  the  persecution under  the  Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius  (a.d. 178).  Over  his  tomb  at  Dijon  has  been  erected the  noble  Abbey  Church  (now  Cathedral)  of St.  Benigne.
♦BENIGNUS  (BENEN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  9)  
(5th  cent.)  A  favourite  disciple  of  St. Patrick,  and  his  siiccessor  in  the  See  of  Armagh. He  is  sometimes  styled  "  Benen,  son  of  Sessenen, St.  Patrick's  Psalmsinger."  The  Martyrology of  Donegal  gives  an  account  of  his  virtues, dwelling  particularly  on  his  piety  and  gentleness. Many  too  were  the  miracles  by  which  Almighty God  bore  witness  to  his  sanctity.  He  appears to  have  resigned  his  pastoral  charge  some  time before  his  holy  death,  which  took  place  about a.d.  469.  His  reputed  sojourn  at  Glastonbury is  probably  fictitious. BENIGNUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  20)

(9th  cent.)  A  holy  woman  of  Cordova, who  was  so  moved  by  the  fortitude  displayed by  St.  Athanasius,  a  Spanish  priest,  during his  martyrdom  at  the  hands  of  the  Moorish invaders  of  the  country,  that  she  braved  death at  the  stake  on  the  following  day  (a.d.  853). Her  ashes  were  thrown  into  the  river  Guadalquivir. *BENINCOSA  (Bl.)  Conf.  (June  20)

(11th  cent.)  Also  called  Benedict.  An  Abbot of  Hildesheim  in  Germany,  who,  appointed Bishop  of  Meissen,  was  much  persecuted  by  the Emperor  Henry  IV,  on  account  of  his  attachment to  Rome.  He,  almost  alone  of  the German  Bishops,  attended  St.  Gregory  the Seventh's  Council,  which  condemned  Henry's usurpation  of  Church  Rights.  Returned  to  his See,  he  died  after  a  long  and  fruitful  Episcopate, ad.  1106. *BENNO  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  3)  
(10th  cent.)  A  prince  of  the  Royal  House  of Burgundy,  who  embraced  the  Ecclesiastical state  and  became  Canon  of  Strasburg.  This dignity,  however,  he  soon  renounced,  and retired  into  solitude  in  Switzerland,  where, over  the  ruined  cell  of  St.  Meinrad  the  Martyr, he  built  a  monastery  for  himself  and  his  disciples, and  thus  founded  the  famous  Abbey  of  Einsiedeln.  The  Emperor  Henry  the  Fowler  called him  to  the  See  of  Metz,  where,  however,  his zeal  met  with  such  hostility  that  he  was  assaulted,  blinded,  and  driven  out  of  the  city. Returning  to  Einsiedeln,  he  survived  for  eleven years,  and  on  his  death  (a.d.  940)  was  buried in  the  Ladye-Chapel  of  the  Abbey  Church. BENVENUTUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  22)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Franciscan  Friar  of  holy  life, who  was  created  Bishop  of  Osimo  in  Central Italy  by  Pope  Urban  IV,  and  governed  that Diocese  for  thirteen  years  in  the  difficult  times of  the  Guelph  and  Chibelline  warfare.  Knowing beforehand  his  death  to  be  at  hand,  he  distributed all  his  goods  to  the  poor,  and  lay  down to  die  before  the  High  Altar  of  his  Cathedral (a.d.  1276).  Many  miracles  having  been wrought  at  his  tomb,  he  was  canonised  by  Pope Martin  IV. *BEOADH  (BEATUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  8)  
(6th  cent.)  Aeodh  (Aidus),  an  Irish  Saint, acquired  the  prefix  Bo  on  accoimt  of  the greatness  of  his  virtues,  and  was  appointed Bishop  of  Ardcarne  (Roscommon).  Little  is known  of  his  Acts,  but  the  tradition  of  his piety  and  miracles  remains.  He  went  to  his reward  between  a.d.  518  and  a.d.  523.  The "  Bell  of  St.  Beoadh,"  a  beautiful  work  of  art, was  long  in  veneration  as  a  relic. *BEOCCA,  ETHOR  and  OTHERS  (April  10)  
(SS.)  MM 
(9th  cent.)  Monks  of  Chertsey  Abbey, burned  in  their  monastery  by  the  heathen Danes,  out  of  hatred  for  the  Christian  Faith, quite  as  much  as  because  they  were  AngloSaxons  (a.d.  878),  and  for  that  reason  venerated in  England  as  Martyrs. *BERACH  (BARACHIAS,  BERACHIUS)  
(St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  15)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Kilbarry (Co.  Dublin).  His  future  sanctity  having  been predicted  by  St.  Patrick,  St.  Berach  from  his birth  was  placed  under  the  care  of  his  uncle, St.  Freoch.  He  afterwards  became  St.  Kevin's disciple,  and  made  a  monastic  foundation  at Cluain-coirpthe  in  Connaught.  He  is  said  to have  survived  into  the  sixth  century,  but  the date  of  his  death  is  uncertain. BERARD,  PETER,  ACCURSIUS,  ADJUTUS  and

But in  that  of  Moutier-en-Der  he  was  stabbed  by an  unworthy  monk  whom  he  had  sharply  rebuked, and  died  of  the  effects  of  the  wound  on Easter  Eve,  A.D.  696.

(12th  cent.)  A  French  monk  of  Poitou  who, after  leading  for  some  time  an  Eremitical  life, and  later  devoting  himself  to  preaching,  retired into  the  Forest  of  Tiron,  and  there  founded  a monastery  which  became  the  Head  House  of a  Benedictine  Congregation.  St.  Bernard  died A.D.  1117  at  the  age  of  seventy.  His  Congregation spread  to  the  British  Isles,  among  its monasteries  being  that  of  the  Isle  of  Caldey.

Otherwise  St.  BERWARD,  which  see.  

BERNARD  of  MENTHON  (St.)  (June  15)  
(11th  cent.)  Born  in  Savoy  A.D.  923,  and styled  Bernard  of  Menthon  or  Mentone,  his birthplace,  a  village  near  Annecy.  He  studied under  Peter  of  Aosta  and  was  elected  Archdeacon of  that  Diocese.  He  founded  the Hospices  of  the  Great  and  Little  St.  Bernard, and  began  a  community  of  Hospitallers  under the  Rule  of  St.  Augustine,  earning  himself  by 

his  zeal  and  charity  to  poor  travellers  and  to the  mountaineers  of  those  regions  the  title  of "  Apostle  of  the  Alps."  He  died  at  Novara  in Piedmont  A.D.  1008,  and  was  at  once  popularly venerated  as  a  Saint,  though  not  formally canonised  till  the  Pontificate  of  Innocent  XI (A.D.  1681).  The  community  he  established in  the  Alps,  as  is  well  known,  still  continues  the charitable  work  he  set  them.  

BERNARD  (St.)  Abbot.  Doctor  (Aug.  20)  

of  the  Church.  

(12th  cent.)  This  famous  French  Saint, surnamed  the  "  mellifluous  Doctor,"  was  born at  Fontaines,  near  Dijon  (A.D.  1091).  At  the age  of  twenty-three  he  consecrated  himself  to God  under  the  leadership  of  the  holy  English Abbot,  St.  Stephen  Harding,  in  the  newly instituted  Abbey  of  Citeaux,  and  became  the second  founder  of  the  austere  Cistercian  Order, of  which  the  Trappists  are  now  the  best  known branch.  In  obedience  to  St.  Stephen,  Bernard, in  the  year  1115,  founded  the  Abbey  of  Clairvaux,  of  which  he  remained  Abbot  for  the  rest of  his  life,  besides  erecting  several  other  monasteries. He  preached  the  Second  Crusade  in France  (a.d.  1146),  exerted  a  strong  and  healthy influence  on  the  European  politics  of  his  age, and  by  his  prudence  and  zeal  healed  more  than one  incipient  schism.  He  passed  away  at Clairvaux,  Aug.  20,  1153,  and  was  buried  in the  Ladye-Chapel  of  his  Abbey.  Since  its destruction  in  1792  his  relics  have  been  venerated in  the  neighbouring  parish  church.  Alexander III  canonised  St.  Bernard  twelve  years after  his  death  ;  and  Pius  VIII  proclaimed  him a  Doctor  of  the  Church.  Notable  among  his writings  are  his  noble  Treatise  on  the  Canticle of  Canticles,  and  his  book,  Be  Consideratione, addressed  to  Pope  Eugene  III,  who  had  been one  of  his  monks.  To  him  also  is  attributed the  familiar  Hymn,  "  Jesu  dulcis  memoria " (Jesus,  the  only  thought  of  Thee).  His  tender devotion  to  Our  Blessed  Lady  has  led  to  the liturgical  use  of  his  Homilies  on  her  festival days.  He  is  often  represented  with  three mitres  on  a  book,  or  at  his  feet,  in  allusion to  his  refusal  of  three  Bishoprics — or  with  a beehive  near  him — or  again,  with  an  Angel holding  his  crozier.  

♦BERNARD  DE  ALZIVA  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  

MM.  (Aug.  21)  
(12th  cent.) A  converted  Moslem  Prince  in 
Spain,  put  to  death  for  the  Faith  (A.D.  1180)  

with  his  two  sisters,  who  had  like  him  embraced 
Christianity.  

BERNARD  PTOLOMEI  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  21) (14th  cent.)  A  citizen  of  Siena,  educated by  his  relative,  Christopher  Ptolemy,  a  learned Dominican  Friar.  He  retired  from  the  world, choosing  the  Rule  of  St.  Benedict  as  that  to be  followed  by  himself  and  such  of  his  friends as  elected  to  place  themselves  under  his  direction. He  thus  founded  the  Congregation  of  the Olivetans,  vowed  to  the  Eremitical  life.  It  was approved  by  several  of  the  Popes  of  the  period, and  still  exists.  The  brethren  are  robed  in white  from  head  to  foot.  St.  Bernard  died A.D.  1348  in  his  sixty-sixth  year.  

BERNARD  (St.)  (Oct.  14)  
(11th  cent.)  Some  writers  say  that  this  holy man  was  by  birth  an  Englishman  ;  others  that he  was  of  French  parentage.  He  appears  to have  come  as  a  pilgrim  to  Rome,  and  afterwards to  have  lived  a  hermit's  life  near  Arpino in  Latium,  where  he  died.  His  relics  are  in high  veneration  in  the  neighbouring  town  of Arce,  whither  they  were  translated.  He probably  died  in  the  latter  half  of  the  eleventh century.  

BERNARD  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  4)  
(12th  cent.)  A  Florentine  of  the  noble  family of  the  Uberti,  who  sacrificed  a  brilliant  career to  become  a  poor  monk  of  the  Order  of  Vallombrosa,  in  its  monastery  of  San  Salvio.  So  remarkable was  he,  however,  not  only  for  sanctity, 
45 

BERNARDINE 
but  for  intellectual  ability  and  skill  in  business, that  he  was  chosen  as  Abbot  General  of  his Order,  and  later  created  Cardinal  by  Pope Urban  II,  who  again  and  again  employed  him as  his  Legate.  He  was  indefatigable  in  putting down  simony,  at  that  period  rife  in  Italy.  Consecrated Bishop  of  Parma  (a.d.  1106)  by  Pope Paschal  II,  he  died  (A.d.  1132)  after  an  Episcopate singularly  distinguished  by  his  success in  promoting  Christian  piety.  He  is  said  to have  steadfastly  continued  the  austerities practised  in  his  Order  to  the  very  day  of  his death. BERNARDINE  of  SIENA  (St.)  (May  20)  
(15th  cent.)  Born  at  Massa  of  the  noble family  of  the  Albizeschi  of  Siena  (a.d.  1380), after  spending  himself  in  the  service  of  the sick  in  the  public  hospitals,  he  entered  the Franciscan  Order,  which  he  illustrated  by  his religious  fervour.  Famous  for  his  devotion  to our  Blessed  Lady,  the  Feast  of  whose  Nativity was  the  date  of  his  own  birth,  of  his  religious profession,  of  his  first  Mass  and  of  his  first sermon,  he  successively  refused  the  Bishoprics of  Siena,  of  Ferrara  and  of  Urbino.  But, elected  VicarGeneral  of  his  Order,  he  was  the author  of  a  great  reform  among  its  members. He  died  at  Aquila  in  the  south  of  Italy  (A.d. 1444)  and  was  canonised  five  years  after  his death  by  Pope  Nicholas  V.  He  has  left  many valuable ascetic writings, and instituted or 
Jropagated  the  cultus  of  the  Holy  Name  of  Jesus, n  art,  he  is  usually  represented  in  the  Franciscan habit,  holding  to  his  breast  the  monogram IHS  (the  three  first  letters  of  the  Greek  form  of that  Most  Holy  name),  with  a  mitre  at  his  feet. He  is  also  pictured  with  the  Infant  Jesus  in  his arms.

But  he  is  chiefly  known  as the  first  Abbot  of  Cluny  near  Macon,  a  famous Benedictine  monastery,  cradle  of  the  great Religious  Congregation  of  the  same  name.  In his  old  age  St.  Berno  resigned  his  crozier  to his  disciple  St.  Odo  (a.d.  926),  dying  in  the following  year. BERONICUS,  PELAGIA  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  

MM.  (Oct.  19)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  group  of  fifty-nine  Christians put  to  death  at  Antioch  in  one  of  the  early persecutions.  Though  all  the  ancient  Martyrologies  register  them  on  Oct.  19,  no  particulars concerning  them  are  now  extant. *BERTELLIN  (St.)  (Sept.  9)  
(Date  uncertain.) An  English  Saint,  a  hermit, 
in  the  neighbourhood  of  Stafford,  whose  legend

♦BERTHA  (St.)  Widow.  (July  4)  
(8th  cent.)  A  holy  woman  of  English extraction  who  built  a  monastery  in  the north  of  France  over  which  she  presided  as Abbess,  and  where  she  died  about  a.d.  725.

(9th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  this  name  occurs  in all  the  Scottish  Kalendars.  He  is  described  as Bishop  of  Kirkwall  in  the  Orkneys,  and  is  said to  have  passed  his  youth  in  the  celebrated monastery  of  St.  Columba  at  Iona.  He  seems to  have  died  in  Ireland  about  a.d.  840 ;  and his  tomb  was  shown  at  Inishmore  on  the  Bay of Gal  way. Hence perhaps his surname of 
46 

Fer-da-Leithe  (the  man  of  two  parts  or  countries).  

♦BERTHOLD  (St.)  (June  16)  
(6th  cent.)  In  the  Breviary,  St.  Berthold  or Bertaud  is  said  to  have  come  from  Ireland with  a  St.  Amandus,  and  to  have  settled  at Chaumont  in  the  Diocese  of  Rheims,  where  he was  ordained  priest  by  St.  Remigius.

He  became  a  lay-brother  in the  monastery  of  St.  Alexander,  where  he  lived a  humble  and  saintly  life,  and  where  his  relics are  preserved.  He  died  about  the  year  1101.

A  Benedictine  monk  who,  it  is said,  resigned  the  dignity  of  Abbot  of  Glastonbury in  order  to  seclude  himself  in  the  insignificant monastery  of  Reculver  in  the  Isle  of Thanet.  He  was  not,  however,  able  to  avoid acceptance  of  the  Archbishopric  of  Canterbury (a.d.  692)  in  succession  to  St.  Theodore.  He assisted  at  the  Synod  of  Nidd,  in  which  St. Wilfrid  was  justified  and  restored  to  his  See. He  consecrated  St.  Aldhelm  to  the  West  Saxon Bishopric  of  Sherborne.  After  a  long  and strenuous  Eniscopate  St.  Brithwald  died A.D.  731.

(8th  cent.)  A  monk  at  Luxeuil  in  Eastern France,  under  his  kinsman,  the  Abbot  St.  Omer, who  preached  the  Gospel  in  various  parts  of France.  Besides  other  monasteries,  he  founded the  Abbey  of  Sithin  (now  St.  Omer),  and became  its  first  Abbot.  In  the  end,  owing  to his  advanced  age,  he  resigned  this  position,  and betook  himself  to  a  hermit's  cell,  where  he  died a  centenarian  (a.d.  709).  Baronius  and  others alter  this  date  to  A.D.  698.

♦BERTUIN  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  11)  
(7th  cent.)  Said  by  some  to  have  been  an Irishman,  by  others  of  a  noble  English  family. He  was  brought  up  in  an  English  monastery, and  the  tradition  is  that  he  was  consecrated Bishop  while  still  in  England,  probably  as  a Missionary  Prelate,  as  he  proceeded  to  Belgium and  settled  on  the  banks  of  the  Sambre,  where he  built  a  church  and  abbey  which  he  dedicated to  Our  Blessed  Lady  at  a  place  called  Maloigne, near  Namur.  a.d.  698  is  given  as  the  date  of his  death.

Famous  for  his  learning  and virtues,  it  was  to  him  that  the  Emperor  Otho  II on  his  deathbed  entrusted  the  guardianship of  his  son  and  successor,  Otho  III.  St.  Berward died  in  the  year  1021  (or  1023),  and  was  canonised by  Pope  Celestine  III  in  1194.  St.  Berward caused  to  be  cast  the  fine  metal  gates of  Hildesheim  Cathedral,  where  is  also  preserved a  splendid  copy  of  the  Gospels,  written  and illuminated  by  the  Saint's  own  hand. BESAS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  27)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  soldier  who  suffered  at  Alexandria in  Egypt  under  the  Emperor  Decius  for having  shown  the  indignation  he  felt  at  the sight  of  the  horrible  torments  inflicted  on  the Martyrs,  SS.  Julian  and  Euno. BESSARION  (St.)  Conf.  (June  17)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  Fathers  of  the Egyptian  Desert.  His  virtues  and  miracles were  such  that  Greek  writers  compare  him  to Moses,  Elias,  and  others  of  the  prophets.  He must  have  died  before  A.d.  400.  The  Greeks keep  his  Feast  on  June  6.
♦BETTELIN  (BETHLIN,  BETHELM)  (Sept.  9) (St.)  Conf.  

(8th  cent.)  Supposed  to  be  the  same  as  the St.  Bertram  whose  memory  is  preserved  at  Ham in  Staffordshire,  where  there  exist  a  chapel, a  spring  and  a  well,  each  called  after  him.  He was  a  disciple  of  St.  Guthlac  and  lived  in  a hermitage  near  Croyland.  It  is  presumed  that his  relics  were  conveyed  to  Stafford  before  the destruction  of  Croyland  by  the  Danes,  and  that this  accounts  for  the  veneration  in  Catholic times  of  St.  Bettelin  in  that  neighbourhood. We  have  no  means  of  fixing  the  precise  date  of the  death  of  this  Saint.
♦BEUNO  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  21)  
(7th  cent.)  Of  a  princely  family  in  ancient Wales,  educated  in  the  monastery  of  Bangor, and  in  his  afterlife  founder  and  ruler  of  several monasteries  in  North  Wales ;  Clynnog  in Carnarvonshire  was  his  chief  residence.  He died,  and  was  buried  there  some  time  in  the first  half  of  the  seventh  century.  Butler  notes some  curious  customs,  vestiges  of  the  ancient cultus  of  St.  Beuno,  existing  in  his  time  in Carnarvonshire ;  but  the  memory  of  the  Saint has  happily  been  revived  in  our  own  age  by the  foundation  of  the  important  Ecclesiastical establishment  known  as  St.  Beuno 's  College. BEUVE  (St.)  (April  24)  

Otherwise  St.  BOVA,  which  see.  

♦BERTILLA  (St.)  V.  (Nov.  5)  
(7th  cent.) An  Abbess  of  the  Benedictine 
Order in the monastery of Jouarre in the 
Diocese  of  Meaux.  She  was  chosen  to  be  the 
first  Abbess  of  Chelles,  where  she  died,  having 
presided  over  her  community  for  more  than 
forty-six years (A.D. 692).  Queen Bathilde, 
the  foundress,  took  the  veil  at  Chelles,  as  did 
St.  Hereswitha  or  Hereswide,  Queen  of  East 
Anglia  and  sister  of  St.  Hilda  of  Whitby.  

BIANOR  and  SYLVANUS  (SS.)  MM. (July  10)  
(4th  cent.) Christians  martyred  in  Pisidia 
(Asia  Minor)  under  an  Imperial  magistrate,  by 
name  Severian.  They  were tortured  and 
beheaded. They probably suffered at the 
beginning  of  the  fourth  century,  but  the  extant 
Greek  Acts  are  not  trustworthy.  

BIBIAN A  (VIBIANA,  VD7IAN)  (St.)  V.M. (Dec.  2)  
(4th  cent.) St. Bibiana  was  the  daughter 
and  sister  of  Martyrs.  Her  father,  St.  Flavian, 
her mother, St. Daphrosa, and her sister, 
St. Demetria, all laid down their lives for 
Christ.  St. Bibiana  herself  was  scourged  to 
death  at  Rome  in  the  persecution  under  Julian 
the  Apostate  (A.D.  363).  A  very  long  account 
is  given  of  her  sufferings  in  a  composition  much 
accredited in the Middle Ages ;  but which 
resists badly scientific  criticism. Her name, 
with  the  place  and  fact  of  her  martyrdom, 

are  all  that  can  be  asserted  with  certainty. Her  fame  has  been  widespread  from  early  ages. She  is  Patron  Saint  of  churches  in  Spain  and  in Germany.  Her  church  in  Rome  was  dedicated by  Pope  St.  Simplicius,  about  one  hundred years  after  her  passion ;  and  she  is  liturgically commemorated  yearly  in  the  Universal  Church on  the  anniversary  of  her  martyrdom.  In  art, she  is  often  represented  holding  in  her  hand  a green  branch  covered  with  twigs  and  foliage.  

♦BIBLIG  (PEBLIG)  (St.)  (July  3)  
(5th  cent,  probably.)  A  Welsh  Saint  connected with  Carnarvon,  but  particulars  concerning whom  are  lacking.  

BIBLIS  (St.)  V.M.  (June  2)  
(2nd  cent.)  One  of  the  Martyrs  of  Lyons, under  the  Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius  (a.d.  177). These  were  the  Bishop  St.  Photinus,  the  virgin St.  Blandina,  and  forty-four  other  Christians. St.  Biblis  was  put  to  the  torture  to  force  her  to admit  the  crime  of  cannibalism  very  commonly at  that  period  imputed  to  Christians.  At  the outset,  terrified  at  the  horrors  of  the  torture chamber,  she  showed  signs  of  weakness,  but strengthened  by  prayer  and  the  example  of her  fellow-sufferers,  she  in  the  end  bravely  laid down,  like  them,  her  life  for  Christ.  

♦BIEUZY  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  24)  
(7th  cent.) A  native  of  Great  Britain,  who 
followed  St.  Gildas  to  Brittany.  We  have  no 
particulars  of  his  life  or  of  the  martyrdom  which 
♦BILFRID(BILLFRITH)  (St.)  (March  6)  
(8th  cent.)  A  hermit,  a  skilled  goldsmith, who  bound  in  gold  the  Lindisfarne  copy  of  the Gospels,  written  and  illuminated  by  Bishop Eadfrid.  In  life  and  in  death  he  was  in  great popular  veneration  on  account  of  the  austere sanctity  of  his  life.  His  death  took  place between  a.d.  740  and  A.D.  756  ;  but  the  day is  uncertain.  March  6  is  the  anniversary  of  the Translation  of  his  relics,  together  with  those of  St.  Balther  to  Durham.
♦BILHILD  (St.)  Widow.  (Nov.  27)  
(8th  cent.) A  holy  woman  who,  after  the 
death  of  her  husband,  founded  a  monastery  at 
Mainz in Germany, where she died a holy 
death,  the  crown  of  a  pious  and  charitable  life.  

BIRILLUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  21)  
(1st  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  consecrated first  Bishop  of  Catania  in  Sicily  by  St.  Peter the  Apostle,  with  whom  he  had  travelled  from Antioch,  about  A.d.  42.  By  his  preaching  and miracles,  it  is  added,  St.  Birillus  converted  a vast  number  of  pagans  to  Christianity,  and died  in  extreme  old  age. BIRINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  3)  
(7th  cent.)  A  missionary  sent  by  Pope Honorius  to  convert  the  West  Saxons  to Christianity,  and  consecrated  Bishop  by Asterius,  Bishop  of  Genoa.  One  of  his  first converts  was  King  Cynegils  of  Wessex,  at whose  baptism  another  monarch,  St.  Oswald of  Northumbria,  officiated  as  godfather.  St. Birinus  died  at  Dorchester  in  Oxfordshire, where  he  had  fixed  his  Episcopal  See,  a.d.  650, whence  Bishop  Hedda  translated  his  body  to the  Church  of  St.  Peter  at  Winchester  (a.d.  686). *BIRNSTAN  (BRISTAN,  BRYNSTAN)  (Nov.  4)  
(St.)  Bp.  

(10th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Frithestan in  the  See  of  Winchester  and  a  disciple  of St.  Grimbald.  He  was  famous  for  his  devotion to  the  Holy  Souls  in  Purgatory  ;  and  it  was  his daily  custom  to  wash  the  feet  of  the  poor.  He was  suddenly  called  away  from  his  labours on  earth  to  the  higher  life  of  Heaven,  Nov.  4, A.D.  934.
♦BITHEUS  and  GENOCUS  (SS.)  Conf. (April  18)  
(6th  cent.) Two  British  monks  who  accompanied St.  Finnian  of  Clonard  to  Ireland,  and there  passed  away  in  peace  and  in  great  repute  of sanctity.  Nothing  more  is  known  about  them. *BLAAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  10 
Otherwise  St.  BLANE,  which  see.

BLADUS 
♦ELADUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  3)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  tradition  concerning him  is  to  the  effect  that  he  was  one  of  the  early Bishops  of  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  that  by  his pastoral  zeal  he  merited  to  be  by  his  flock honoured  as  a  Saint. BLASE  (BLAISE)  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  3)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Sebaste  in  Armenia, famous  for  the  miracles  he  wrought,  among which  was  his  having  with  a  word  saved  from imminent  death  a  boy  choking  from  having half  swallowed  a  fishbone  so  placed  that  its extraction  was  impossible.  St.  Blaise,  a  man of  saintly  life,  was  accused  and  tried  as  a Christian,  and  as  chief  of  his  fellow-believers in  the  persecution  continued  in  the  East  after the  Emperor  Constantine  had  given  peace  to the  Church  elsewhere,  by  his  colleague  Licinius. The  Saint  was  put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded at  Sebaste  A.d.  316.  His  Feast  is  kept  with much  solemnity  in  Greece  and  in  Asia  Minor. The  Crusaders  propagated  devotion  to  him  in Europe.  In  some  places  bread  is  blessed  on his  Feast  Day,  of  which  a  morsel  is  swallowed while  invoking  him.  In  others,  oil  is  blessed, and  with  it  a  priest  makes  the  sign  of  the  cross on  the  throats  of  the  Faithful.  He  is  the recognised  Patron  Saint  of  wool-combers, whether  because  he  was  tortured  by  having  his flesh  torn  with  the  iron  combs  used  in  the trade,  or  for  some  other  reason,  is  uncertain.
♦BLAITHMAIC  (BLATHMAC,  BLAITHMALE)  
(St.)  M.  (Jan.  19)  
(9th  cent.)  The  son  of  one  of  the  Irish  kings who  became  a  monk,  and  at  last  the  Abbot  of his  monastery.  Thirsting  for  the  glory  pi martyrdom,  he  left  his  native  country  and crossed  over  to  Great  Britain,  then  in  prey  to the  heathen  Danes.  He  was  murdered  by  these barbarians  on  the  altar  steps  in  St.  Columba's monastery  at  Iona  (a.d.  823).  The  Benedictine Walafridus  Strabo  has  written  in  verse  the  Life of  St.  Blathmac.
♦BLANCHE  (GWEN)  (St.)  (July  5)  

See  SS.  FRAGAN  and  GWEN. BLANDA  (St.)  M.  (May  10)  

See  SS.  CALEPODIUS,  PALMATIUS, &c. BLANDINA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  2)  
(2nd  cent )  One  of  the  most  famous  of  the Martyrs  of  Lyons,  who  with  St.  Photinus  suffered death  for  Christ  (A.D.  177),  in  the  time  of  the Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius.  St.  Blandina,  a young  girl,  never  ceased  from  encouraging  her fellow-sufferers,  even  while  herself  in  the  hands of  the  torturers.  She  was  scourged,  mauled by  wild  beasts,  made  to  sit  on  a  red-hot  iron chair,  gored  by  a  bull,  and  finally  beheaded. The  blood  of  these  holy  men  and  women  was the  seed  of  Christianity  in  Gaul.
♦BLANE  (BLAIN,  BLAAN)  (St.)  Bp. (Aug.  10)  
(7th  cent.)  A  celebrated  Scottish  Saint  who is  said  to  have  been  Bishop  of  Kingarth  in  Bute at  the  end  of  the  sixth  or  beginning  of  the seventh  century.  He  was  buried  at  Dunblane, where  the  Cathedral  and  several  other  churches were  dedicated  in  his  honour.  But  the  dates commonly  given  are  altogether  uncertain. His  reputed  connection  with  St.  Comgall  and St.  Kenneth  would  put  that  of  his  birth  after a.d.  550,  whereas  Butler,  Dempster  and  others insist  that  he  flourished  in  the  fifth  century. The  Bollandists,  on  the  other  hand,  describe him  as  having  flourished  in  the  tenth  or  eleventh century,  surmising  a  confusion  of  names  between St.  Kenneth  and  King  Kenneth,  his  namesake. Hence,  the  modern  hypothesis  that  there  were two  St.  Blanes,  of  whom  one  lived  in  the  fifth and  the  other  in  the  eleventh  century.  Hymns and  prose  compositions  bearing  the  name  of St.  Blane  are  still  extant. BLASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  29)  
(1st  cent.)  Associated  by  tradition  with St.  Mary  Salome  in  planting  the  first  seeds  of the  Christian  Faith  at  Veroli  and  Frosinone, between  Rome  and  Naples.  He  is  said  to  have 
48 

been  put  to  death  for  being  a  Christian,  as early  as  a.d.  42.  A  St.  Demetrius  and  twenty others  are  named  as  having  suffered  with  him. But  there  is  now  a  tendency  among  scholars  to dissociate  altogether  St.  Blasius  from  St.  Mary Salome  and  her  Apostolate,  and  to  date  his  life several  hundred  years  later. *BLATH  (FLORA)  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  29)  
(6th  cent.)  In  the  Irish  Martyrologies, several  Saints  are  registered  under  the  name Blath  (Latinised  Flora).  The  one  best  remembered was  a  humble  lay-sister  in  St.  Brigid's monastery  at  Kildare,  where  she  was  in  high repute  of  sanctity.  The  year  523  is  assigned in  the  Martyrology  of  Donegal  as  that  of  her death. *BLEDRWS  (St.)  
(Date unknown.) There is a church in 
Cardiganshire  titled  after  a  St.  Bledrws. But 
it  has  not been found possible to identify 
the  Saint.  

♦BLEIDDAN  (BLE WDIAN)  (St.)  Bp. (July  29)  

Otherwise  St.  LUPUS  of  TROYES,  which  see.
♦BLENWYDD  (St.)  
(Date  unknown.) The  dedication  of  a  chapel to  him  in  the  Isle  of  Anglesea  is  all  that  perpetuates his  memory. *BLITARIUS  (BLIER)  (St.)  (June  11)  
(7th  cent.)  A  native  of  Scotland  who  passed over  into  France  with  St.  Fursey,  and  settled at  Seganne  in  Champagne.  He  is  still  in  great local  veneration,  and  is  described  as  having been  a  man  whose  whole  life  was  spent  in penance  and  prayer.  His  relics  were  burned  by the  Calvinists  in  the  sixteenth  century. *BOETHIUS  (St.)  (Dec.  7)  

Otherwise  St.  BUITHE,  which  see. *BOBO  (St.)  (May  22)  
(10th  cent.)  A  soldier  of  Provence  (France) who  distinguished  himself  in  the  defence  of his  country  against  the  Moorish  raiders,  the terror  of  the  south  of  France,  and  who  later gave  himself  up  to  a  life  of  piayer  and  penance. He  died  at  Pavia  in  Lombardy  (A.D.  985)  while on  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome. *BODAGISIL  (St.)  (Dec.  18)  
(6th  cent.)  A  noble  Frank  who,  after  a  life spent  in  the  service  of  his  King  and  country, founded  a  monastery  on  the  banks  of  the Meuse,  where  he  died  (a.d.  588).  Venantius Fortunatus,  St.  Gregory  of  Tours,  and  other contemporary  writers  are  loud  in  the  praises of  his  sanctity. *BODFAN  (BODUAN)  (S.)  
(7th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Abern  in Carnarvon.  He  is  believed  to  have  flourished in  the  seventh  century,  but  we  have  no  particulars of  his  life,  except  the  tradition  that  the great  inundation  which  formed  Beaumaris  Bay impelled  him,  with  his  father  and  some  other relatives,  to  embrace  the  Religious  life. *BOETIAN  (St.)  (May  22)  
(7th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Fursey  and  an Irishman  by  birth.  He  built  his  monastery at  Pierrepont,  near  Laon,  in  France,  and  was eventually  murdered  there  by  miscreants  whom he  had  sternly  rebuked  for  their  vices.  His shrine  is  still  a  place  of  pilgrimage,  and  he  is specially  invoked  in  behalf  of  sick  children. *BOISIL  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  23)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Prior  of  Melrose  Abbey  and successor  there  of  Abbot  Eata.  Bede  describes him  as  a  man  of  great  virtue  and  as  endued  with the  gift  of  prophecy.  Among  his  disciples  were St.  Cuthbert  and  St.  Egbert.  The  Holy  Name of  Jesus,  pronounced  so  as  to  touch  the  hearts of  all  who  heard  him,  was  ever  on  his  lips.  He passed  away  during  the  great  pestilence  of  the year  664. *BOLCAN  (OLCAN)  (St.)  Bn.  (Feb.  20)  
(5th  cent.)  Baptised  by  St.  Patrick  and  sent by  him  to  study  in  France,  he  was  subsequently by  the  same  Saint  consecrated  Bishop  of  Derkan in  the  North  of  Ireland.  His  school  of  learning there  was  one  of  the  most  distinguished  in  the 
BONIFACE 

island.  He  died  after  a.d.  480.  Another  St. Bolcan  is  venerated  in  the  parish  of  Kill-Chule in  the  Diocese  of  Elphin.  He  is  known  as St.  Olcan  of  Kilmoyle.  

BOLONIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  of  fifteen, who  was  tortured  and  put  to  death  about A.D.  362  in  the  persecution  under  Julian  the Apostate,  and  who  has  left  her  name  to the  village  of  St.  Boulogne  in  the  Haute Marne.  

BONA  (BOVA)  and  DODA  (SS.)  VV.MM.  (April  24) (7th  cent.)  St.  Bona  or  Bova  (Fr.  Beuve) was  a  daughter  of  King  Sigebert  of  Austrasia (Eastern  France).  She  took  the  veil  in  a convent  near  Rheims,  founded  by  the  holy Queen  Clotilde,  and,  with  her  brother,  St. Baudry  (Balderic),  built  the  Abbey  of  St.  Peter within  the  walls  of  Rheims,  of  which  she  became the  first  Abbess.  During  her  government  of twenty-three  years  her  patience  and  humility won  all  hearts,  and  even  during  her  lifetime  she was  regarded  as  a  Saint.  Sbe  died  a.d.  673, and  was  succeeded  by  her  niece,  St.  Doda, likewise  venerated  as  one  of  the  Blessed.  

BONAJUNCTA  (St.)  Conf.  (Aug.  31)  

One  of  the  HOLY  SEVEN  FOUNDERS  OF THE  SERVITE  ORDER,  which  see.  

BONAVENTURE  (St.)  Bp.,  Doctor  (July  14)  

of  the  Church.  

(13th  cent.)  Known  as  the  "  Seraphic Doctor."  Born  A.D  1231,  at  Bagnorea  in Tuscany,  he  entered,  at  the  age  of  twenty, the  Order  of  St.  Francis.  He  studied  and afterwards  taught  at  Paris,  in  company  of  St. Thomas  Aquinas.  After  being  General  of  his Order,  he  was  created  by  Pope  Gregory  X Cardinal  Bishop  of  Albano.  He  died  during  the General  Council  of  Lyons  (A.D.  1274),  and  was canonised  two  hundred  years  later,  becoming  a Doctor  of  the  Church  a  century  later.  Besides noble  Commentaries  on  Holy  Scripture  and  on the  work  of  the  Master  of  Sentences  (the  theological and  philosophical  text-book  in  use  in his  age),  we  have  from  the  pen  of  St.  Bonaventure  many  ascetical  and  mystical  treatises, and  a  touchingly  beautiful  Life  of  St.  Francis of  Assisi,  the  Founder  of  his  Order.  Clement IV  had  chosen  him  for  the  Archbishopric  of York ;  and  only  the  humility  of  the  Saint hindered  the  English  people  from  being  able to  number  the  "  Seraphic  Doctor "  among their  national  glories.  

♦BOND  (BALDUS)  (St.)  Hermit.  (Oct.  29 
(7th  cent.)  A  penitent  and  Saint  venerated at  Sens  in  France.

♦BONIFACE  of  LAUSANNE  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  9) (13th  cent.)  A  Cistercian  monk  of  the Abbey  of  Cambre,  near  Brussels.  He  was distinguished  for  his  learning,  and  lectured  at Paris  and  at  Cologne.  Appointed  Bishop  of Lausanne,  he  laboured  indefatigably  at  the reform  of  Church  discipline.  In  his  old  age  he retired  to  die  (A.D.  1265)  in  his  monastery  at Cambre.  

BONIFACE  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  5)  

Alleged  to  have  been  the  name  of  one  of  the Christians  who  suffered  with  SS.  PALMATIUS and  OTHERS,  which  see.  

♦BONIFACE  (Bl.)  Bp.  (March  13)  
(13th  cent.)  A  member  of  the  Ducal  House of  Savoy,  who  became  a  Carthusian  monk  and Prior  of  one  of  the  houses  of  his  Order,  whence, so  great  was  the  fame  of  his  sanctity,  he  was, at  the  request  of  King  Henry  III  of  England, by  the  Pope  raised  to  the  See  of  Canterbury in  succession  to  St.  Edmund.  He  died  while on  a  visit  to  his  native  country,  and  was  buried in  the  Ducal  vault  at  Hautecombe  (A.D.  1270). Three  centuries  later  his  body  was  found  to  be still  incorrupt.  His  cultus  was  authorised  by Pope  Gregory  XVI  in  the  nineteenth  century. 

♦BONIFACE  (St.)  Bp.  (March  14)  
(7th  cent.)  A  leader  of  a  band  of  missionaries sent  from  Rome  to  evangelise  the  Picts  and Scots.  He  is  venerated  as  Bishop  of  Ross, and  is  said  to  have  founded  one  hundred and  fifty  churches.  He  passed  away  about A.D.  630.

BONIFACE  (St.)  M.  (May  14)  
(4th  cent.)  Beheaded  as  a  Christian  at  Tarsus in  Cilicia,  whither  he  had  gone  from  Rome  to recover  the  bodies  of  certain  Martyrs.  His own  relics  repose  in  the  church  dedicated  to him  in  Rome  on  the  Aventine,  together  with those  of  St.  Aglae,  a  woman  associated  with him  both  before  and  after  their  conversion  to Christianity.

Elected  Pope, A.D.  608,  he  dedicated  to  Our  Blessed  Lady  and to  all  the  Saints,  the  Pantheon  built  by  Marcus Agrippa  as  the  temple  of  all  the  heathen  gods of  Rome,  and  enriched  it  with  the  relics  of Martyrs  from  the  Catacombs.  He  held  a Council  (A.D.  610),  at  which  St.  Mellitus,  Bishop of  London,  was  present.  He  died  A.D.  615, and  was  buried  in  Old  St.  Peter's,  under  the altar  of  St.  Thomas  the  Apostle,  or,  as  some say,  in  the  atrium  or  courtyard  before  the BfLsilicft 
BONIFACE  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (June  5)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon,  born  at  Crediton in  Devonshire,  who  received  in  Baptism  the name  of  Winfried.  Educated  in  monasteries at  Exeter  and  Winchester,  he  lived  for  many years  as  a  Benedictine  monk ;  but,  feeling himself  called  to  a  missionary  career,  set  forth (a.d.  716)  to  preach  the  Gospel  to  the  heathen people  of  Friesland.  Later,  Pope  St.  Gregory II  consecrated  him  Bishop,  and,  giving  him  the name  of  Boniface,  sent  him  to  evangelise Germany,  of  which  country  he  is  venerated  as the  Apostle.  Having  chosen  Mainz  as  his Metropolitan  See,  he  gave  himself  indefatigably to  his  work,  which  was  wonderfully  blessed  by Almighty  God.  Twenty-two  years  later  he resigned  his  Archbishopric  in  order  to  return to  his  unfinished  task  in  Friesland.  There, together  with  fifty-two  companions,  he  suffered martyrdom  at  the  hands  of  the  pagans,  A.D.  755. His  body  reposes  in  the  Abbey  of  Fulda,  and innumerable  miracles  have  been  wrought  at his  tomb.  One  of  his  achievements  in  Germany was  the  felling  of  an  enormous  oak  tree,  the centre  of  the  idolatrous  worship  of  the  natives, which  led  to  a  conversion  en  masse  of  all  the spectators.  Hence,  in  art,  he  is  often  represented with  axe  in  hand  at  the  foot  of  an 
BONIFACE  (St.)  Bp.  (June  19)  
(11th  cent.)  The  Apostle  of  Livonia  and  of the  West  of  Russia,  better  known  as  St.  Bruno. He  succeeded  St.  Adalbert  of  Prague  in  the headship  of  the  School  of  Magdeburg,  and  was for  some  time  chaplain  to  his  relative,  the Emperor  Otho  III.  Leaving  the  Imperial Court,  he  entered  the  Camaldolese  Order  of monks,  and  retired  to  Italy.  Thenceforward he  lived  in  solitude  till,  by  order  of  Pope  John XVIII,  he  took  up  the  work  of  evangelising the  Northern  countries.  With  great  gain  of souls  he  preached  in  Poland  and  succeeded in  penetrating  into  Russia  proper,  where however,  he  fell  a  victim  to  the  fury  of  the heathen.  He  was  seized,  and  with  eighteen Christians,  his  fellow-workers,  beheaded  a.d. 1009.

BONIFACE 
BONIFACE  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  30)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  African  Christian  martyred with  his  wife  St.  Thecla  and  their  twelve children  at  Hadrumetum  in  the  persecution under  Decius  (a.d.  250).  There  are,  however, some  of  the  learned  in  these  matters  who post-date  their  martyrdom  for  half  a  century, and  maintain  that  they  were  victims  of  the great  persecution  under  Diocletian  and  his colleague  Maximinian  Herculeus.  Again,  there are  authors  who  hold  that  they  escaped  both persecutions,  and  survived  to  die  natural deaths.  It  is  controverted  whether  the  twelve children  of  SS.  Boniface  and  Thecla  are  not  the Twelve  Holy  Brothers  commemorated  in  the Liturgy  on  Sept.  1.  

BONIFACE  I  (St.)  Pope.  (Oct.  25)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Roman  priest  of  saintly  life, elected  Pope  (A.D.  418),  in  succession  to  St. Zozimus,  notwithstanding  his  reluctance. Though  pre-eminently  "  a  man  of  peace,"  he vindicated  bravely  and  successfully  the  rights of  the  Holy  See  against  the  Anti-Pope  Eulalius, and  against  the  pretensions  of  the  Patriarchs of  Constantinople.  He  ordered  the  singing  of the  Gloria,  in  excelsis  on  Maundy-Thursday,  and regulated  several  points  of  Church  discipline. He  passed  away  towards  the  close  of  the  year 423,  and  was  buried  in  an  Oratory  of  St. Felicitas,  which  with  many  other  sacred  buildings he  had  restored  and  embellished.  

BONIFACE  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  6)  
(5th  cent.)  An  African  Martyr  put  to  death with  several  others  by  the  Arian  Hunneric, King  of  the  Vandals.  Among  them  were Dionysia  and  her  son  Majoricus,  Dativa,  her sister,  and  iEmilian  her  cousin,  a  physician.  

BONIFACE  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  29)  
(Date  unknown.)  Martyred  in  Rome  with SS.  Calixtus  and  Felix.  

BONIFACE  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  17) (5th  cent.)  St.  Boniface  was  a  deacon martyred  at  Carthage  in  the  time  of  Hunneric, Arian  King  of  the  Vandals  (a.d.  477  to  a.d.  488). His  fellow-sufferers  were  SS.  Liberatus,  an Abbot,  Servus  and  Austicus,  sub-deacons, Rogatus  and  Septimus,  monks,  and  Maximus, a  boy,  all  members  of  the  community  of  monks established  at  Capsa  near  Tunis.  After  having undergone  cruel  tortures,  they  were  scourged to  death.  

BONITUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  15)  
(8th  cent.)  Born  in  Auvergne  A.D.  623,  he became  Chancellor  to  King  Sigebert  III, afterwards  Governor  of  Provence  and  nine years  later  Bishop  of  Clermont  in  Auvergne. After  a  zealous  Episcopate  he  retired  into  a monastery,  and  in  the  eDd  died  at  Lyons (A.D.  710),  while  returning  from  a  pilgrimage to  Rome.  He  is  known  in  France  as  St.  Bont or  Bonet.  His  relics  are  in  the  Cathedral  at Clermont.  

BONONIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  30)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Benedictine  Abbot  of  Vercelli  in Piedmont,  who  preached  the  Gospel  in  the  East, and  who  died  at  Bologna  in  Italy  (a.d.  1026).  

BONOSA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyred  at  Porto  Romano, at  the  mouth  of  the  Tiber,  under  Severus (A.D.  207),  with  her  brother  Eutropius,  and  her sister  Zozima.  Modern  discoveries  made  at Porto  Romano  go  to  negative  the  old  opinion post-dating  the  martyrdom  of  St.  Bonosa  to  the time  of  the  Emperor  Aurelian.  

BONOSUS  and  MAXIMIANUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  21) (4th  cent.)  Bonosus,  an  officer  of  the  Herculean Legion,  serving  under  Count  Julian, uncle  of  the  Apostate,  was  tortured  and  put  to death  with  his  comrade  Maximinian  or  Maximilian, for  refusing  to  change  the  Christian banner,  the  Labarum  of  Constantine,  for  the idolatrous  standard  of  heathen  times  (a.d.  362).  

BONUS,  FESTUS.MAURUS  and  OTHERS  (Aug.l) (SS.) (3rd  cent.) Bonus, a  priest,  with Festus, 
50 

Maurus  and  nine  others,  was  martyred  at  Rome under  the  Emperor  Valerian  (a.d.  257).  They are  mentioned  in  the  Acts  of  St.  Stephen,  Pope, though  the  name  Bonus  does  not  occur  therein. He  is  probably  the  same  with  Basil,  one  of  the Martyrs  they  note.  

BORIS  (St.)  M.  (July  24)  

See  SS.  ROMANUS  and  DAVID.  

BORIS  and  GLEB  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  25)  
(11th  cent.  These  Saints,  otherwise  called Romanus  and  David,  sons  of  St.  Vladimir,  are included  in  Polish  Calendars  as  having  suffered martyrdom,  a.d.  1015,  at  the  hands  of  assassins incited  thereto  by  their  elder  brother,  usurper of  their  possessions.  

♦BOSA  (St.)  Bp.  (March  9)  
(8th  cent.)  A  monk  of  St.  Hilda's  Abbey  at Whitby,  and  the  predecessor  of  St.  John  of Beverley  in  the  Archbishopric  of  York,  to which  he  was  called  in  the  troubled  times  of the  exile  of  St.  Wilfrid,  by  St.  Theodore  of Canterbury.  St.  Bosa  was  a  man,  says  the Venerable  Bede,  of  conspicuous  virtue  and humility.  He  died  A.D.  705.  

BOSWELL  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  23)  

Otherwise  St.  BOISIL,  which  see.  

♦BOTULPH  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  17)  
(7th  cent.)  He  and  his  brother,  St.  Adulph, were  Anglo-Saxons,  but  entered  a  monastery in  Belgium.  St.  Adulph  became  Bishop  of Utrecht,  and  St.  Botulph  returned  to  England and  founded  a  Benedictine  Abbey  at  Icanhoe in  Lincolnshire  (a.d.  654),  which  was  destroyed by  the  Danes  in  the  ninth  century.  St.  Botulph died  about  the  year  700,  and  his  relics  were removed  to  Thorney  by  St.  Ethelwald.  Boston in  Lincolnshire  is  an  abbreviated  form  of Botulph's  Town,  and  several  churches  were dedicated  to  him,  among  them  four  at  the  gates of  the  City  of  London.  

BOTVID  (St.)  M.  (July  28)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Swedish  Christian,  who endeavoured  to  convert  to  the  Faith  a  captive from  Finland.  Having  as  he  thought  succeeded, he  sought  to  restore  the  neophyte  to freedom  and  to  his  own  country,  but  while  on the  voyage  was  cruelly  murdered  by  the  thankless object  of  his  compassion  (a.d.  1100).  

♦BRADAN  and  ORORA  (CRORA)  (SS.)  (Oct.  20) (Date  uncertain.)  These  two  Saints  are honoured  in  the  Isle  of  Man.  In  the  church of  St.  Bradan,  Kirk-Braddan,  near  Douglas, Mark,  the  Bishop  of  Sodor,  held  a  Synod (A.D.  1291).  In  a  map  of  the  sixteenth  century, reference  is  made  to  the  churches  of  St.  Patrick and  St.  Crora.  

♦BRANNOCK  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  7)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Saint  who  appears  to  have migrated  in  the  sixth  century  from  South Wales  into  Devon,  and  to  have  founded  a monastery  at  Braunton,  near  Barnstaple,  in that  county.  The  traditions  concerning  him are,  however,  very  varying  and  unreliable, though  possibly  the  place  named  Braunton perpetuates  his  memory.  But  see  St.  Brychan (April  7).  

♦BRANWALLANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  19)  
(Date  unknown.)  We  have  also  a  St.  Branwallator.  St.  Branwallanus  and  he  may possibly  be  identical  with  St.  Brannock.  We hear  of  them  only  in  connection  with  Translations of  Relics  in  Saxon  times.  All  alike  are West-Country  Saints.  

♦BRANWALLATOR  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  19)  
(Date  unknown.)  Beyond  the  fact  that  his name  was  included  with  others  in  the  Dedication of  a  church  in  Dorsetshire,  where  likewise  relics of  his  were  venerated,  we  have  no  information concerning  him.  He  may,  perhaps,  be  one  and the  same  with  St.  Brannock  or  St.  Branwallanus, or  with  both.  

BRAULIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  27)  
(7th  cent.) Braulius  or  Braulio,  Bishop  of 
Saragossa  in  Spain,  and  one  of  the  Patrons  of 
the Kingdom of Aragon, assisted at three 
BRIDGET 

Councils  of  Toledo.  He  was  a  disciple  of St.  Isidore  of  Seville,  and  part  of  their  correspondence is  still  extant.  Together  they laboured  at  regularising  Ecclesiastical  discipline in  Spain,  and  after  the  death  of  St.  Isidore, St.  Braulio  completed  some  unfinished  works he  had  left.  St.  Braulio  is  one  of  the  most celebrated  Saints  of  the  Spanish  Church.  He died  a.d.  646,  after  over  twenty  years  of Episcopate.  

♦BREACA  (BREAGUE)  (St.)  V.  (June  4)  
(6th  cent.)  She  is  said  to  have  gone  from Ireland  to  Cornwall  about  the  year  460,  with several  companions,  and  to  have  landed  on  the Eastern  bank  of  the  river  Hayle.  Several of  the  holy  maidens  were  slain  by  King  Theodoric  or  Tewder.  St.  Breague  lived  the  life of  a  solitary,  and  died  in  the  early  part  of  the sixth  century  in  high  repute  of  sanctity.  

♦BREACA  (BRANCA,  BANKA)  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  27) (5th  cent.)  One  of  a  band  of  Irish  Saints who  settled  in  Cornwall  in  the  latter  part  of the  fifth  century.  She  is  said  to  have  been born  in  East  Meath.  Various  days  are  assigned for  her  festival ;  nor  is  it  possible  definitely to  distinguish  her  from  the  Saint  Breaca  or Breague  venerated  on  June  4.  

♦BREGWIN  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  26)  
(8th  cent.)  The  twelfth  Archbishop  of Canterbury  (a.d.  761).  His  life  was  written by  Eadmer,  who  gives  little  more  than  the date  of  his  Pontificate,  and  an  account  of  his many  miracles.  He  was  buried  in  the  Chapel of  St.  John  the  Baptist  at  the  East  end  of  the Cathedral  (A.D.  765).  Letters  of  his  to  St. Lullus  of  Mainz  are  still  extant.  

♦BRELATE  (St.)  Abbot.  (May  16)  

Otherwise  St.  BRENDAN,  which  see. He  seems  to  have  visited  Jersey  on  his  return from  Brittany  to  Ireland.  A  place-name  there commemorates  him.  There  were  probably  two Sts.  Brendan,  and  St.  Brelade  may  have  been of  later  date  than  his  homonym.  

♦BRENACH  (St.)  Hermit.  (April  7)  
(6th  cent.)  The  name  is  variously  spelled, Brenach,  Brynach,  Bernach.  He  was  a Pembrokeshire  hermit  who  inhabited  a  lonely cell  near  Milford  in  the  sixth  century.  But  we have  no  authentic  record  of  his  life.  

BRENDAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (May  16)  
(6th  cent.)  A  celebrated  Irish  monk,  a  disciple of  St.  Finnian  at  Clonard,  and  of  St.  Gildas of  Llancarvan  Abbey  in  Wales.  There  St. Brendan  had  St.  Malo  among  his  own  disciples. He  died  at  the  age  of  ninety-four  (a.d.  578) at  Enachduin  in  Connaught.  He  founded several  schools  and  monasteries,  among  them the  famous  Abbeys  of  Ardfert  and  Clonfert, and  wrote  a  monastic  Rule  remarkable  for  its austerity.  St.  Brendan's  celebrated  voyage to  the  West,  resulting  in  his  discovery  of America,  the  "  Land  of  Promise,"  is,  by  many, not  without  some  evidence,  upheld  as  an historical  fact.  It  certainly  cannot  lightly  be rejected  as  a  mere  myth,  though  it  had  no immediate  results.  

♦BRENDAN  of  BIRR  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  29)  
(6th  cent.)  Sometimes  called  St.  Brendan the  Elder  to  distinguish  him  from  his  namesake, the  still  more  celebrated  St.  Brendan  of  Clonfert, his  contemporary  and  fellow-disciple  with him  of  St.  Finnian  of  Clonfert.  His  Abbey  of Birr  was  somewhere  near  Parsonstown  in  King's County.  He  was  the  great  friend  and  adviser of  St.  Columba,  who  in  a  vision  saw  the  holy soul  of  St.  Brendan  carried  by  angels  to  Heaven at  the  moment  of  his  passing  away  (a.d.  562).  

BRETANNION  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  25)  
(4th  cent.)  Bishop  of  Tomis  in  Scythia  on the  Black  Sea,  near  the  mouths  of  the  Danube. Valens,  the  Arian  Emperor,  exiled  him  on account  of  his  strenuous  defence  of  the  Christian Dogma  of  the  Blessed  Trinity,  but  was compelled  by  popular  discontent  to  recall  him. The  Saint  died  about  a.d.  380. 

♦BRIACH  (St.)  Abbot.  (Dec.  17)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  Irish  birth  who  became a  monk  in  Wales  under  St.  Tudwald,  whom  he accompanied  to  Brittany.  He  built  a  monastery at  Guingamp,  near  the  castle  of  Deroch, Prince  of  Leon.  He  died  at  Bourbiac  in  the year  570,  or,  as  others  say,  in  627,  and  was buried  in  the  local  church.  

♦BRIANT  (ALEXANDER)  (Bl.)  M.  (Dec.  1)  

See  Bl.  ALEXANDER  BRIANT.  

♦BRIAVEL  (St.)  (June  17)  
(Date  unknown.)  Her  name  is  perpetuated as  that  of  the  Patron  Saint  of  the  parish  of St.  Briavels  in  the  Forest  of  Dean  in  Gloucestershire ;  but  no  record  of  her  life  is  extant.  

BRICTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  9)  
(4th  cent.)  Bishop  of  Martola  near  Spoleto in  Umbria  (Central  Italy;.  During  the  persecution under  Diocletian  he  was  imprisoned  for preaching  Christianity,  but  miraculously  escaped and  zealously  persevered  in  his  ministry,  passing to  his  reward  after  the  Peace  of  the  Church under  Constantine  (A.d.  312).  It  must,  however, be  confessed  that  the  traditional  details given  concerning  him  are  of .  very  uncertain authenticity.  

BRICE  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  13)  

Otherwise  St.  BRIXIUS,  which  see.  

BRIDGET  (BRIDE,  BRIDIG)  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  1) (6th  cent.)  The  "Mary  of  Ireland"  was born  of  Christian  parents  at  Fouchard  (Foughard)  in  the  present  county  of  Louth,  then reckoned  as  part  of  Ulster,  about  the  middle of  the  fifth  century.  Her  parents  are  said  to have  been  baptised  by  St.  Patrick  himself, and  they  brought  up  their  children  in  the  holy fear  of  God.  From  her  infancy  Bride  gave  signs of  the  sanctity  to  which  God's  grace  was  leading her.  In  due  time  the  Bishop  St.  Mel  or,  as others  say,  St.  Machalleus,  his  disciple,  gave her  the  veil  of  holy  Religion,  and  she  founded the  monastery  of  Kildare,  the  first  Religious House  of  women  in  Ireland.  Wonderful were  the  miracles  she  wrought,  and  equally marvellous  her  influence  for  good  over  the nascent  Church  of  her  country.  She  passed away  about  the  year  523,  and  her  remains were  enshrined  with  those  of  St.  Patrick,  as being  the  relics  of  the  Second  Patron  Saint of  Ireland.  In  art,  St.  Bride  is  represented holding  a  cross — with  a  flame  over  her  head — sometimes  with  a  cow  near  her,  she  being reputed  the  Protectress  of  those  engaged  in dairy  work.  

♦BRIDGET  and  MAURA  (SS.)  (July  13)  
(5th  cent.)  Venerated  as  two  daughters  of a  Scottish  chieftain,  martyred  in  Picardy  in the  fifth  century  while  on  a  pilgrimage  to Rome.  The  details  have  not  been  satisfactorily ascertained.  St.  Louis  of  France  had  a  great devotion  to  SS.  Bridget  and  Maura.  

We  have  also  two  other  pairs  of  holy  sisters  : Maura  and  Britta,  mentioned  by  St.  Gregory  of Tours  ;  and  Baya  and  Maura,  whose  names appear  in  the  ancient  Scottish  Kalendars. How  far  all  these  are  distinct  personages  is uncertain.  

BRIDGET  (St.)  Widow.  (July  23)  
(14th  cent.)  St.  Bridget  (Birgitta)  born  of a  noble  Swedish  family  (a.d.  1304)  and  married to  a  man  of  princely  rank,  after  her  husband's death,  founded  the  monastery  of  Wadstena on  the  shore  of  Lake  Wetten,  thus  instituting the  Order  of  the  Most  Holy  Saviour,  commonly known  as  Bridgetines.  For  its  regulation  she drew  up  wise  statutes  which  were  confirmed  by Pope  Urban  V.  St.  Bridget  was  favoured  by Almighty  God  with  marvellous  visions  and revelations,  of  which  the  record  left  by  her  to us  is  most  useful  to  contemplative  souls.  She died  in  Rome  on  her  return  from  Jerusalem (July  23,  1373),  and  was  canonised  twenty years  later.  Her  Feast  is  kept  by  the  Church on  Oct.  8,  anniversary  of  the  Translation  of her  relics  to  Sweden. In  art  she  is  represented 
51 

BRIEUC 
clothed  in  the  Religious  Habit  of  her  Order — with  a  pilgrim's  staff — holding  a  heart  marked with  a  cross — with  Our  Saviour  near  her. BRIEUC  (St.)  Bp.  (May  1)  

Otherwise  S.  BRIOCUS,  which  see. *BRIGA  (BRIGID)  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  21)  
(6th  cent.)  She  is  known  as  St.  Brigid  of Kilbride,  in  the  Diocese  of  Lismore,  and  flourished in  the  fifth  and  sixth  centuries.  It  is alleged  that  her  famous  namesake  of  Kildare visited  her  more  than  once  at  Kilbride.  In the  Calendar  of  Cashel  she  is  styled  St.  Brigid of  Killbrige. BRIGID  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  1)  
(9th  cent.)  Not  of  course  to  be  confused with  the  great  St.  Bride  of  Kildare,  whose Festival  is  kept  on  the  same  day.  This  later St.  Brigid  was  a  sister  of  St.  Andrew,  the Archdeacon  of  St.  Donatus  of  Fiesole  in  Tuscany. She  was  present  at  his  deathbed,  carried thither,  it  is  said,  by  angels.  After  his  death she  retired  to  a  cave  in  the  Apennines,  where she  closed  her  life  some  time  in  the  ninth century.  Soon  after  a  church  was  built  over her  cave,  which  contained  her  grave. BRINSTAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  4)  

Otherwise St. BIRNSTAN or BIRSTAN, tvJiicTi  sec* BRIOCUS  (BRIOC,  BRIEUC)  (St.)  Bp.  (May  1)  
(6th  or  7th  cent.)  A  native  of  Cardiganshire, who  was  educated  in  France  by  St.  Germanus. He  returned  to  Britain,  where  he  converted  to Christianity  his  own  parents  with  other  pagans. Crossing  again  to  France,  he  settled  in  Brittany and  founded  the  great  monastery  which  bears his  name,  and  has  given  it  to  the  important town  surrounding  it.  It  was  there  he  died  in his  ninetieth  year.  In  the  parish  of  St.  Breock in  Cornwall  the  annual  fair  is  still  held  on May  1,  his  Feast  Day.  There  were  many translations  of  his  relics.  The  epoch  in  which he  lived  (6th  or  7th  cent.)  depends  on  whether his  instructor  was  St.  Germanus  of  Paris  or (which  is  much  more  likely)  St.  Germanus  of Auxerre,  whom  he  probably  followed  to  France when  that  Saint  returned  from  Britain  after his  preaching  against  the  heresy  of  Pelagius.
♦BRITHWALD  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  9)  
(8th  cent.)  One  of  the  early  Archbishops of  Canterbury,  the  successor  of  St.  Theodore. He  was,  says  Butler,  "  a  living  rule  of  perfection to  his  Church."  St.  Brithwald  died  after  nearly forty  years  of  Episcopate,  A.D.  731,  and  was buried  at  Reculver  at  the  edge  of  the  Isle  of Thanet,  where  at  that  time  there  existed  a small  monastery.  His  name  is  frequently spelled  Bercthwald. *BRITHWOLD  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  22)  
(11th  cent.)  A  monk  of  Glastonbury  who became  Bishop  of  Wilton  or  Ramsbury  on  the Translation  of  Alfric  to  the  See  of  Canterbury (a.d.  996).  He  was  distinguished  for  his  gift of  prophecy  and  is  described  as  "  vir  sanctissimus  in  the  Liturgical  Lections  of  the  Feast of  St.  Edward  the  Confessor.  He  was  buried at  Glastonbury  a.d.  1043. *BRITTA  and  MAURA  (SS.)  VV.  (July  13)  
(5th  or  6th  cent.)  Two  Saints  mentioned  by St.  Gregory  of  Tours.  They  are  chiefly  venerated in  the  Diocese  of  Beauvais  in  France, and  are  traditionally  reputed  to  have  been Princesses  of  Northumbria  or  of  Scotland. Some  assert  that  they  were  put  to  death  for their  Faith.  Britta  is  a  name  variously  spelled, and  is,  it  would  seem,  a  form  of  Brigid  or Bridget ;  but  all  is  very  uncertain.  (See  SS. Breaca  and  Maura.) *BRITWIN  (BERCTHUN  ?)  (St.)  Abbot.  (May  15)  
(8th  cent.)  The  holy  Abbot,  friend  of St.  John  of  Beverley,  who  assisted  that  Saint in  his  last  moments  and  enshrined  his  remains. He  lived  in  the  eighth  century,  and  is  commemorated by  Venerable  Bede  and  registered as  a  Saint  in  old  English  Calendars.

BRIXIUS(BRITIUS,BRICCIUS,BRICE)  (Nov.  13) (St.)  Bp.  

(5th  cent.)  A  native  of  Tours  and  disciple of  the  great  St.  Martin,  in  the  monastery  of Marmoutiers.  He  himself  was  raised  to  the Archbishopric  on  the  death  of  his  master. Owing  to  calumny  he  suffered  exile  ;  but  was restored  to  his  See  by  the  authority  of  the  Pope, who  was  convinced  of  his  innocence.  He  died seven  years  after  his  return,  a.d.  447.  His body  was  translated  to  Clermont  in  Auvergne by  St.  Gregory  of  Tours  (A.D.  580).  

♦BROCARD  (St.)  (Sept.  2)  
(13th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Berthold in  the  government  of  the  Hermits  of  Mount Carmel.  At  his  request  St.  Albert  Patriarch of  Jerusalem  drew  up  for  them  the  Rule  under which  they  developed  in  the  West  into  the Order  of  Mount  Carmel.  St.  Brocard  died early  in  the  thirteenth  century.  

♦BRON  (St.)  Bp.  (June  8)  
(6th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Patrick,  consecrated Bishop  of  Cassel-Irra,  near  the  town  of Sligo,  where  he  founded  a  church.  He  appears to  have  died  about  a.d.  511.  

♦BRONACH  (BROMANA)  (St.)  V.  (April  2)  
(Date  unknown.)  Called  the  Virgin  of  GlenSeichis  and  registered  in  the  Martyrologies  of Tallaght  and  Donegal.  But  we  have  neither dates  nor  other  particulars  concerning  her. Glen-Seichis  is  the  old  name  of  Kilbrony  or Kilbronach,  in  County  Down,  which  takes  its present  appellation  from  her.  

♦BRONISLAVA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  3)  
(13th  cent.)  A  relative  of  the  Polish  Saint Hyacinth.  She  led  a  holy  life  at  Cracow, where  her  memory  is  still  in  great  veneration.  

♦BROTHEN  and  GWENDOLEN  (SS.)  (Oct.  18) (6th  cent.)  Of  these  Welsh  Saints  we  know little  beyond  their  names  and  the  fact  of  their existence,  coupled  with  that  of  the  cultus locally  given  to  them  after  their  deaths.  St. Brothen  is  Patron  Saint  of  Llanbrothen  in Merionethshire.  According  to  the  Welsh genealogies,  he  had  a  brother,  St.  Gwynnin. The  two  churches  of  Llangwynnin  and  Dwygyfylchi,  both  in  Carnarvonshire,  may  have  been called  thus  after  him.  Dolwyddelen  and Llanwyddelan  in  Montgomeryshire  suggest  a St.  Gwendolen.  *  This  and  similar  names  are diminutives  of  Gwen  (white),  and  are  equivalent to  our  Blanche  and  its  allied  forms.  

BRUNO  (St.)  (Oct.  6)  
(11th  cent.)  The  founder  of  the  Carthusian Order,  born  at  Cologne  about  a.d.  1030.  After being  Chancellor  and  Canon  Theologian  of Rheims  Cathedral,  he  retired  with  others  to the  solitude  known  as  the  Grande  Chartreuse, where  they  were  welcomed  by  St.  Hugh, Bishop  of  Grenoble,  thus  laying  the  foundations of  their  Order,  which  is  flourishing  even  in  the present  century.  Pope  Urban  II,  a  former disciple  of  St.  Bruno,  summoned  him  to  Rome to  be  his  Councillor.  He  obeyed,  but  shortly after,  refusing  the  Episcopal  See  of  Reggio, retired  into  the  mountains  of  Calabria,  where he  assembled  a  community  of  monks  and resumed  the  life  of  the  Grande  Chartreuse. He  died  there  a.d.  1101,  and  five  hundred  years later  was  canonised  by  Pope  Gregory  XV. He  wrote  Commentaries  on  the  Psalter  and  on the  Epistles  of  St.  Paul.  The  emblems  artists associate  with  him  are  a  crucifix  with  leaves and  flowers,  a  star  on  his  breast,  a  globe  under his  feet,  a  chalice  with  the  Sacred  Host,  &c.  &c.  

BRUNO  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  19)  

Otherwise  St.  BONIFACE,  which  see.  

BRUNO  (St.)  Bp.  (May  17)  
(11th  cent.)  Matilda,  mother  of  this  Saint, was  a  niece  of  St.  Bruno  or  Boniface,  the martyred  Apostle  of  Prussia  and  Russia.  Her son  became  Bishop  of  Wurzburg  (Herbipolis), and  one  of  the  most  erudite  scholars  of  his time. He  wrote  informing  Commentaries  on 
C.ECILIUS 

Holy  Scripture.  He  was  the  adviser  of  Emperors, but,  what  is  much  more,  earned  the title  of  "  Father  of  the  poor."  Having  built the  Cathedral  of  Wurzburg,  he  died  (a.d.  1045) from  the  effects  of  an  accident.  He  is  renowned for  miracles  wrought  in  life  and  after  death.  

BRUNO  (St.)  Bp.  (July  18)  
(12th  cent.)  A  Lombard  by  birth  and  a distinguished  scholar.  After  his  conclusive defence  of  the  Catholic  doctrine  of  the  Eucharist at  the  Council  of  Rome  (a.d  1079),  Pope  St. Gregory  VII  made  him  Bishop  of  Segni.  He assisted  at  several  Councils,  and  for  a  time  was Abbot  of  Monte  Cassino.  He  died  a.d.  1125. He  has  left  several  useful  Theological  works.  

♦BRYNACH  (BERNACH,  BERNACUS) (April  7) (St.)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who  settled  in Wales,  where  he  built  a  cell  and  church  at  a place  now  called  Carn-Englyi  (Mountain  of Angels),  overhanging  the  Nevern  (Pembrokeshire). It  is  conjectured  that  he  flourished  in the  first  half  of  the  fifth  century.  By  some authors  he  is  identified  with  St.  Brannock  of Braunton.  

♦BRYNOTH  (St.)  Bp.  (May  9)  
(14th  cent.)  A  Swede,  Bishop  of  Scara  in West  Gothland,  who  passed  away  Feb.  6,  1317, and  is  honoured  in  Sweden  as  a  Saint.  

♦BUDOC  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  9)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Breton  Saint,  educated  in Ireland,  where  he  became  Abbot  of  Youghal. Returning  afterwards  to  Brittany,  he  succeeded SS.  Samson  and  Maglorius  in  the  See  of  Dol. He  died  early  in  the  seventh  century  after about  twenty  years  of  Episcopate.  There seem  to  have  been  two  other  Saints  of  the  same name  also  connected  with  Brittany.  

♦BUITHE  (BUITE,  BOETHIUS)  (St.)  (Dec.  7) (6th  cent.)  A  Scot  who,  after  passing  many years  in  Italy  and  elsewhere  on  the  Continent, returned  to  his  native  country  in  company with  St.  Codrus,  and  helped  in  the  evangelisation of  the  Picts.  From  him  it  seems  that  Carbuddo (Castrum  Buithii)  takes  its  name.  He  is  said to  have  prophesied  the  birth  of  St.  Columba, and  to  have  died  on  the  day  that  Saint  was born  (a.d.  521).  

BULGARIA  (MARTYRS  OF)  (July  23)  
(9th  cent.)  During  the  war  between  the Greek  Emperor  Nicephorus  and  the  Bulgars, not  as  yet  Christians,  many  Catholics,  besides those  slain  in  battle,  were  put  to  death  on account  of  their  Faith.  There  is  much  uncertainty as  to  how  this  came  about,  but  they have  always  been  reckoned  as  Martyrs.  

♦BURIANA  (St.)  V.  (June  4)  
(Gth  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  one  of  the  many who  migrated  to  Cornwall  and  there  in  solitude led  holy  lives.  The  place-name  St.  Buryan, opposite  the  Scilly  Islands,  perpetuates  the memory  of  St.  Buriana.  

BURCHARD  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  14)  
(8th  cent.)  An  English  Saint  of  wealthy parentage  who  devoted  his  early  manhood  to helping  and  working  for  the  poor.  Having joined  the  missionary  band  led  by  St.  Boniface into  heathen  Germany  and  laboured  successfully there,  Pope  Zaohary  consecrated  him First  Bishop  of  Herbipolis  (Wurzburg),  "  Zealous as  a  Pastor  of  souls,  meek  and  generous,  but ever  humble  and  hard  upon  himself,"  for  so he  is  described,  he  died  (a.d.  752)  at  Hohenberg (Homburg),  whither  he  had  retired,  and  had lived  a  monastic  life  for  his  last  six  months upon  earth.  His  relics  were  translated  to Wurzburg  a.d.  983.  

BURGONDOPHORA  (FARA)  (St.)  V.  (April  3) (7th  cent.)  Born  of  a  noble  Frankish  family, she  was  favoured  from  her  childhood  with heavenly  visions  and  other  supernatural favours.  She  received  the  holy  veil  of  religion from  the  famous  Abbot  St.  Columbanus,  but on  account  of  her  having  refused  to  marry,  was cruelly  persecuted  by  her  disappointed  father. 

In  the  end,  however,  he  was  reconciled  to  his daughter,  and  built  for  her  the  monastery  of Faremoutiers,  near  Meaux.  Influenced  by  her, her  brother  St.  Fare  gave  himself  to  God.  St. Burgondophora  passed  away,  surrounded  by her  weeping  nuns,  April  3,  655,  being  then sixty  years  old. *BYBLIG  (PIBLIG) (St.)  (July  3)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  holy  man  honoured  with some  cultusm.  parts  of  Wales,  but  nothing  certain is  known  about  him. 

C 
♦CADELL  (St.)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Saint,  giving  its  title to  Llangadell  in  Glamorgan.
♦CADFAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  1)  
(6th  cent)  A  holy  man  who  came  over  from Brittany  to  Wales  and  became  the  first  Abbot of  Bardsey.  He  has  left  his  name  to  Llangadfan in  Montgomeryshire,  but  we  have  no  reliable account  of  his  life.  
♦CADFARCH  (St.)  (Oct.  24)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Saint,  disciple  of St. Illtyd,  and member of a family of Saints. He  is  said  to  have  founded  churches  at  Penegos and  Aberick  . *CADOC  (DOCUS,  CATHMAEL)  (St.)  (Jan.  24) Bp.  M.  

(6th  cent.)  The  son  of  a  Welsh  chieftain and  founder  of  the  celebrated  monastery  of Llancarvan  in  Glamorgan,  which  became  a veritable  house  of  Saints.  Accompanied  by St.  Gildas,  St.  Cadoc  later  continued  his  Religious life  in  an  island  off  the  coast  of  Vannes  in Brittany.  Finally,  he  again  crossed  the Channel  and  settled  in  the  Eastern  counties, as  is  believed,  taking  spiritual  charge  of  the Britons,  his  compatriots  in  those  parts  during their  last  struggle  with  the  conquering  Saxons, at  whose  hands  he  received  the  Crown  of  Martyrdom about  a.d.  580,  near  Weedon  (Benevenna) in  Northamptonshire. *CADOG  (St.)  
(5th  cent.) The Patron Saint  of  LlaodogFaur  in  Carmarthen,  not  to  be  confused  with the  later  St.  Cadoc  or  Docus.
♦CADROE  (St.)  (March  6)  
(10th  cent.) A  noble  Scotsman,  a  monk  at Fleury  on  the  Loire,  and  afterwards  at  Metz. He  died  A.D.  975  while  on  a  visit  to  the  Empress Adelheid,  mother  of  the  Emperor  Otho  1. *CADWALLADOR  (St.)  King.  (Nov.  12)  
(7th  cent.)  A  chieftain  in  Wales  of  the ancient  British  race,  not  to  be  confused  with the  Anglo-Saxon  St.  Cadwalla.  St.  Cadwallador  was  venerated  as  a  Saint  in  Wales  after his  death  (a.d.  682,  probably). CECILIA,  C^ELESTINE, &c.  

Otherwise  often  written  CECILIA,  CELESTINE,  and  sometimes  C03LESTINE. OECILIA  (CECILIA,  CICELY)  (St.)  V.M.  (Nov.  22) (2nd  cent.)  One  of  the  most  famous  Virgin Martyrs  of  the  early  Roman  Church.  Of Patrician  birth  and  a  zealous  Christian,  she converted  to  Christianity  her  betrothed  husband, Valerian,  with  his  brother  Tiburtius,  who,  like her,  both  gave  their  lives  for  Christ.  Cecilia was  seized  as  a  Christian  and  suffocated  with the  steam  of  a  hot  bath  in  her  own  mansion, later  converted  into  a  church.  The  probable date  is  the  reign  of  Septimus  Severus  (a.d. 193-222).  Her  relics  were  recovered  from  the catacombs  by  Pope  St.  Paschal  I  (a.d.  821). C^ECILIAN  (St.)  (April  16)

(3rd  cent.)  A  convert  to  Christianity, afterwards a priest at Carthage, where his

CESAREA 
memory  was  held  in  veneration.  In  his  old age  he  taught  Christ's  religion  to  St.  Cyprian, who  reverenced  him  as  the  "  Father  of  his  own new  life."  He  had  had  a  wife  and  children, of  whom  St.  Cyprian  is  said  to  have  taken charge.  St.  Jerome  says  that  it  was  from  him that  St.  Cyprian  took  the  name  Csecilius. St.  Csecilius  flourished  in  the  first  half  of  the third  centurv.
♦C^ESAREA  (St.)  V.  (May  15)  
(Date  unknown.)  An  Italian  who,  in  defence of  her  virtue,  took  refuge  in  a  cave  near  Otranto in  the  South  of  Italy,  and  appears  thenceforth to  have  lived  therein  as  a  Recluse.  The cave  is  now  a  place  of  popular  pilgrimage.
♦CyESARIA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  12)  
(6th  cent.)  The  sister  of  St.  Caesarius  of Aries.  She  was  Superior  of  a  convent  of  nuns for  whom  her  brother  wrote  a  somewhat  strict monastic  Rule.  She  passed  away  about  a.d. 530. C^SARIUS  of  ARLES  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  27)  
(6th  cent.)  "  The  first  Ecclesiastic  in  the Gaul  of  his  time  "  (Smith  and  Wace).  Born at  Chalon-sur-Saone  in  the  year  470,  he  retired at  the  age  of  twenty  to  the  famous  monastery of  the  Isle  of  Lerins  in  the  Mediterranean. Ten  years  later  he  became  Archbishop  of  Aries, and  presided  over  several  Councils,  among  them that  of  Orange  (a.d.  529),  against  the  SemiPelagians.  He  is  best  known  for  his  Liturgical reforms  and  for  his  efforts  to  propagate  and perfect  monachism.  The  Rules  he  wrote  for monks  and  nuns  are  still  extant.  He  also  took a  somewhat  prominent  part  in  the  politics  of the  period,  and  more  than  once  was  banished by  his  opponents  when  in  power.  He  died A.D.  542. OffiSARIUS  and  JULIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  1)  
(1st  cent.)  Caesarius,  a  deacon  from  Africa, while  witnessing  at  Terracina  a  barbarous human  sacrifice  boldly  proclaimed  himself a  Christian,  and  denounced  the  proceedings. He  was  thereupon  seized  by  the  heathen  mob and  thrown  into  the  sea.  Julian,  a  priest, shared  his  fate.  They  are  probably  Martyrs of  the  very  beginnings  of  Christianity  in  Italy, though  some  contend  that  they  are  among  those who  died  in  the  great  persecution  under  Diocletian after  the  year  300.  A  church  outside Rome,  on  the  Appian  Way,  gives  his  title  of St.  Caesarius  to  one  of  the  Cardinal  Deacons. C/ESARIUS,  DACIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  (Nov.  1) (Date  unknown.)  A  group  of  seven  Christians, registered  in  the  Martyrologies  as  having suffered  at  Damascus  in  Syria.  But  dates  and all  particulars  have  been  lost. C^SARIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  3)  

See  SS.  GERMANUS,  THEOPHILUS, &c. CAESARIUS  (St.)  M.  t  (Dec.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  who  suffered  at Arabissa  in  Armenia  under  Galerius  Maximus (A.D.  309  about).  He  was  the  father  of  Eudoxius,  the  notorious  Arian,  nor  had  his  own past  life  been  irreproachable.  But  by  his courage  at  the  stake,  to  which  he  was  nailed by  the  feet,  he  atoned  for  his  past  misconduct, in  the  eyes  of  his  fellow-Christians,  who  reverently interred  his  half-charred  remains. *C/EDMON  (St.)  (Feb.  10)  
(7th  cent.)  A  farm-servant  at  Whitby  Abbey under  the  great  Abbess,  St.  Hilda,  and  later, one  of  the  Lay-Brethren  attached  to  the  house. The  little  we  know  of  him  we  owe  to  Venerable Bede.  He  was  a  man  of  singular  simplicity, and  of  a  piety  such  as  to  have  merited  to  him a  place  among  those  popularly  venerated  as Saints.  His  memory  is  otherwise  preserved as  having  probably  been  the  first,  or  almost  the first,  among  the  Anglo-Saxons  to  write  in  verse. He  confined  himself  exclusively  to  sacred  subjects, and  in  particular  put  into  verse  the Books  of  Genesis  and  Exodus.  The  remains attributed  to  him  undoubtedly  reveal  poetic genius.  He  died  about  A.D.  680. 54 

♦C#3LLAINN  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  3)  
(6th  cent.) An  Irish Saint  of  the  race  of Ciarr.  The church of Tearmon Caelaine in Roscommon  recalls  her  memory. C/EREALIS, POPULUS, CAIUS  and SERAPION 
(SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  28)  
(Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  of  uncertain  date at  Alexandria  in  Egypt.  Some  ancient  MSS. read  Cerulus  for  Cserealis. OffiREALIS  (St.)  M.  (June  10)  

See  SS.  GETULITJS,  CEREALIS, &c. CffiREALIS  and  SALLUSTIA  (SS.)  MM. (Sept.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  soldier  and  his  wife, 
converted  to  Christianity  by  Pope  St.  Cornelius.  

They  suffered  martyrdom  with  him  under  the 
persecuting  Emperor  Decius,  a.d.  250.

See  SS.  VICTOR,  ZOTICUS,  &c. C/ESARIUS  of  NAZIANZUM  (St.)  (Feb.  25)  
(4th  cent.)  The  brother  of  St.  Gregory  of Nazianzum  and  physician  at  the  Imperial Court  of  Constantinople,  where  for  a  time  he enjoyed  the  favour  of  even  Julian  the  Apostate. But  in  the  end,  driven  into  exile  on  account  of his  Faith,  he  had  to  suffer  in  common  with other  Christians,  until  recalled  to  Court  by Valens,  by  whom  he  was  promoted  to  the questorship  of  Bithynia.  It  is  said  that  he was  preparing  to  retire  into  a  monastery  when death  overtook  him  in  A.d.  368  or  369.  His funeral  oration,  preached  by  his  holy  brother, may  be  read  in  the  works  of  the  latter. C/ESIDIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  31)  
(3rd  cent.)  Caesidius,  said  to  have  been the  son  of  St.  Rufinus,  Bishop  and  Martyr, was  a  priest  who  with  other  Christians  laid down  his  life  in  defence  of  his  religion  on  the shores  of  Lake  Fucina,  sixty  miles  to  the  East of  Rome,  in  one  of  the  persecutions  of  the  third century.  But  there  is  much  uncertainty  both as  to  the  exact  date  and  as  to  the  particulars  of their  sufferings. *CAGNOALD  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  6)  
(7th cent.) A brother of SS. Pharo and 
Burgondophora,  trained  by  the  famous  Abbot 
St.  Columbanus.  He  became  Bishop  of  Laon

♦CAIDOC  and  FRICOR  (ADRIAN)  (SS.) (April  1)  
(7th  cent.)  Two  holy  men  of  Irish  origin, who  out  of  a  desire  to  spread  the  knowledge of  the  Gospel,  journeyed  to  the  country  of the  Morini  early  in  the  seventh  century.  They made  many  converts  to  Christianity,  among whom  was  St.  Ricarius,  founder  of  the  Abbey of  Centula.  Their  relics,  enshrined  at  Ponthieu, were  held  in  great  veneration. *CAILLIN  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  13)  
(7th cent.) Associated with St. Maedhoc 
(Edan)  of  Ferns,  and  notable  for  a  miracle  by 
which he turned certain unbelieving Druids 
into  stone.  

♦CAIMIN  (CAMMIN)  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  24)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who  embraced  a life  of  great  austerity  on  an  island  in  Lough Derg,  to  which  his  reputation  for  sanctity attracted  many  disciples.  Later  in  life  he founded  a  monastery  and  church  on  the  Island of  the  Seven  Churches.  He  was  a  fellowworker  with  St.  Sennen.  The  Psalter  of St. Caimin, copied  with  his  own hand, still 
♦CAIRLON  (CAORLAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  24)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irish  Abbot,  said  to  have died  and  to  have  been  restored  to  life  by St.  Dageus.  Afterwards,  when  St.  Cairlon had  been  made  Archbishop  of  Cashel,  St.  Dageus placed  himself  and  his  monks  under  his  rule.

(3rd cent.)  St. Caius, an officer of the 
CALLISTUS 

Imperial Palace, together  with  twenty-seven (some  MSS.  have  thirty-seven)  other  Christians, is  registered  as  having  been  thrown  into  the sea  or  into  a  river,  for  refusing  to  renounce their  religion,  either  under  Valerian  (A.D.  254259)  or  in  the  great  persecution  under  Diocletian at  the  end  of  the  century,  but  at  what place  is  not  recorded. CAIUS  and  ALEXANDER  (SS.)  MM. (March  16) (2nd  cent.) Two  Christians, put  to  death for the Faith at Apamea in Phrygia (Asia Minor) under the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (about  a.d. 172).  They had previously distinguished themselves  by  their  persistent refusal to have communion with the CataPhrygian heretics, otherwise  known  as  Montanists,  one  of  the  most  widely  spread  sects of  their  time. CAIUS  and  CREMENTIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  16) (4th  cent.) Martyrs  at  Saragossa  in  Spain in the persecution under Diocletian, about a.d.  304. CAIUS  of  MELITENE  (St.)  M.  (April  19)

CAIUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (April  22)  
(3rd  cent.) The  successor  (A.D.  283)  of  Pope 
St.  Eutychian.  He  is  said  to  have  been  by 
birth  a  Dalmatian,  and  related  to  the  Emperor 
Diocletian.  Though  he  was  not  put  to  death 
for  the  Faith,  his  many  sufferings  in  the  cause 
of  religion  have  earned  for  him  the  title  of 
Martyr. He  died  a.d.  296.  The  formal 
recognition  of  the  six  Orders,  Ostiarius,  Lector, 
Exorcist, Acolyte, Subdeacon  and Deacon, 
as  preliminary  to  the  Priesthood,  is  attributed 
to  him.  

CAIUS  and  LEO  (SS.)  MM.  (June  30)  
(Date  unknown.) Martyrs  either  in  Africa 
or  in  Rome.  Caius  (or  Cursinus)  a  priest,  and 
Leo, a Subdeacon, are commemorated with 
Timotheus, Zoticus and others in ancient 
Martyrologies, but  dates and particulars are 
now  unattainable.

CAIUS  of  MILAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  27)  
(1st  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Barnabas  the 
Apostle, who  governed  the  Church  of  Milan 
for  twenty-four  years, and  was  distinguished 
for  his  zeal  and  piety.  He  baptised  the  Martyr 
St. Vitalis with his sons SS. Gervase and 
Protase.  He  passed  away,  probably  A.D.  85.  

St.  Charles  Borromeo  enshrined  his  relics  in  the 
Church  of  St.  Francis  at  Milan  (A.D.  1571).

(3rd  cent.)  Victims  at  Alexandria  in  Egypt 
of the  persecution  under  Valerian  (A.D.  257).  

Caius  and  Faustus  are  probably  the  Saints  of 
those  names  commemorated  with  St.  Dionysius 
of  Alexandria,  their  Bishop,  on  Oct.  3.  Euse
bius,  a  deacon,  survived  to  become  Bishop  of 
Laodicea, and  died  a.d. 269. Chseremon, 
who  had  already  suffered  under  Decius,  was 
sent  into  exile. Of  Lycius  nothing  certain  is 
known.

♦CAJAN  (St.)  (Sept.  25)  
(5th cent.) A son or grandson of King 
Brychan of Brecknock.  His church of  Tre
gaidian  in  Anglesea  perpetuates  his  memory.  

CAJETAN  (St.)  (Aug.  7)  
(16th  cent.) Of  the  noble family  of the 
Lords  of  Thienna,  near  Vicenza,  in  Lombardy.  

Born  a.d.  1480,  and  from  his  youth  upwards 
known as "  The Saint," he renounced the 
dignities  offered  him  in  Rome  in  order  to  devote 
himself  to  the  service  of  the  sick  and  of  the  poor 

of  Vicenza.  Later,  with  Peter  Caraffa  (afterwards Pope  Paul  IV)  he  founded  the  Congregation of  Regular  Clerks,  called  Theatines,  from Theate  (Chieti)  in  the  Abruzzi,  where  Caraffa was  Bishop.  This  Institute  was  one  of  the most  prominent  among  the  fruits  of  the  revival of  Christian  piety  in  the  sixteenth  century, and  distinguished  by  the  absolute  trust  in Divine  Providence  which  was  its  characteristic. It  spread  through  Italy  during  the  lifetime  of the  Founder,  and  exists  to  our  own  day.  St. Cajetan  died  at  Naples  a.d.  1547.

See  SS.  FLORIANUS,  CALANICUS, &c. CALEPODIUS,  PALMATIUS,  SIMPLICIUS, FELIX,  BLANDA  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  

(May  10) (3rd  cent.)  A  number  of  Roman  Christians who  perished  during  the  reign  of  the  Emperor Alexander  Severus.  The  Pope  of  the  time, St.  Callistus,  was  the  most  distinguished  victim  ; but  St.  Calepodius,  a  priest,  was  the  first  to  suffer. St.  Palmatius,  who  was  of  consular  rank,  died with  his  wife  and  children  and  forty-two  of  his retainers,  as  did  St.  Simplicius,  a  Senator,  with sixty-eight  of  his  family  and  dependents. SS.  Felix  and  Blanda,  husband  and  wife,  shared the  lot  of  their  fellow-believers.  These  Martyrs were  not  arraigned  before  judges  and  condemned after  a  regular  trial ;  but  seem  to  have  been victims  of  an  outburst  of  fury  on  the  part  of the  heathen  mob.  In  the  ninth  century,  six centuries  after  their  death  (a.d.  222-235),  their relics  were  removed  from  the  Catacombs  and enshrined  in  the  Church  of  Sta.  Maria  in  Trasevere. CALIMERIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (July  31 )  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Greek,  educated  in  Rome  by Pope  St.  Telesphorus,  who,  having  joined  the clergy  of  Milan,  governed  that  Church  as Bishop  for  more  than  fifty  years,  and  suffered imprisonment,  tortures,  and  exile  under  the Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius.  St.  Calimerius made  innumerable  converts  to  Christianity, devoting  himself  wholly  to  the  service  of  his flock.  Towards  the  close  of  the  reign  of  Commodus  (a.d.  191)  he  was  called  upon  to  die for  Christ,  and  was  cast  headlong  into  a  deep well.  He  is  buried  under  the  High  Altar  of his  church  at  Milan. CALLINICA  and  BASILISSA  (SS.)  MM.  (March  22) (3rd  cent.)  Basilissa,  a  rich  lady  of  Galatia in  Asia  Minor,  was  distinguished  for  her  charitable zeal  in  succouring  the  Christians  imprisoned on  account  of  their  religion.  Callinica (often  written  Callinicus)  was  her  helper  in  her good  works.  In  the  end  they  were  both apprehended  and  executed  as  Christians,  some time  in  the  third  century,  most  probably  in  the persecution  under  Decius  (a.d.  250).  
♦CALLISTHENE  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  4)  

See  SS.  ADAUCTUS  and  CALLISTHENE. CALLISTUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  14)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Todi  in  Central Italy,  distinguished  for  his  zeal  in  repressing Arianism.  In  the  fifth  year  of  his  Episcopate, having  reproved  the  excesses  of  some  noblemen of  evil  life,  he  was  put  to  death  by  their  servants (A.D.  528),  and  on  that  account  honoured  as  a Martvr. CALLISTUS  (CALIXTUS)  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Oct.  14) (3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth,  the  successor of  Pope  St.  Zephyrinus,  whose  Archdeacon  or representative  he  had  been.  His  five  years  of vigorous  Pontificate  were  marked  by  many salutary  measures :  the  moderating  of  the rigour  of  the  penitential  discipline  ;  the  repression of  the  Patripassians,  Sabellians  and  other heretics  ;  the  fixing  of  the  Ember  Day  Fasts, &c.  &c.  He  seems  to  have  met  with  much opposition,  and  at  length,  probably  in  a  riot or  outburst  of  the  heathen  against  the  Christians, was  flung  headlong  from  the  window  of  a  high 
55 

CALLISTUS 
building  in  the  Trastevere  quarter  (A.D.  223). He  was  buried  in  the  Catacombs  of  St.  Calepodius,  his  contemporary,  and  his  relics  now repose  together  with  those  of  that  Saint  in  the Church  of  Santa  Maria  in  Trastevere,  close  to the  scene  of  his  martyrdom.  

The  document  called  the  Philosophoumena, an  anonymous  production  of  the  heretics  of his  time,  written  to  besmirch  the  memory  of the  holy  Pope,  notwithstanding  the  credit given  to  it  by  Bunsen  and  by  Protestant  writers in  general,  has  been  amply  refuted  by  Dollinger and  others. CALLISTUS,  FELIX  and  BONIFACE  (Dec.  29)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  Roman  Martyrs,  concerning whom  dates  and  particulars  are  lost,  but whose names are registered in all the best Western  Martyrologies. CALOCERUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  11)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  disciple,  as  some  assert,  of St.  James  the  Greater,  the  Apostle,  and  probably a  Greek  by  birth.  He  attached  himself  to St.  Apollinaris,  first  Bishop  of  Ravenna. Having  efficiently  aided  the  latter  for  many years  in  the  administration  of  his  Diocese,  he became  his  successor.  He  died  at  an  advanced age,  about  a.d.  130,  under  the  Emperor  Hadrian. CALLINICUS  (St.)  M.  (July  29)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  who,  at  Gangrae, the  chief  town  of  Paphlagonia  in  Asia  Minor, after  having  been  scourged  and  put  to  the torture,  was  burned  to  death  for  the  Faith. The  precise  date  is  unknown,  but  Metaphrastes gives  full  details  of  his  martyrdom,  and  he  is in  great  honour  in  the  Eastern  Church. CALLINICUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  28)

(3rd  cent.)  An  Eastern  Martyr  who  was subjected  to  unheard-of  tortures  and  afterwards beheaded.  The  Greek  Menaea,  while  giving many  details,  are  silent  as  to  the  place  where she  suffered.  The  probable  date  is  the  short reign  of  the  Emperor  Decius,  about  a.d.  250. CALLIOPIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  7)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  who,  under  Diocletian, was  crucified  head  downwards  at  Pompeiopolis in  Cilicia  (Asia  Minor)  about  a.d.  303. CALLISTA  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  2)  

See  SS.  EVODIA,  HERMOGENES, &c. CALLISTRATUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  (Sept.  26)  

MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  A  body  of  fifty  African  soldiers, put  to  death  at  Constantinople  under  the Emperor  Diocletian  at  the  close  of  the  third century  for  the  crime  of  being  Christians.  It  is related  of  them  that  they  were  sewn  up  in sacks  and  cast  into  the  sea. CALLISTUS,  CHARISIUS  and  OTHERS  (April  16)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(3rd cent.)  Nine Christians of Corinth, thrown  into  the  sea  during  one  of  the  persecutions of  their  time  (probably  in  that  of  Decius, about  A.D.  250). CALLISTUS  (St.)  M.  (April  25)  

See  SS.  EVODIUS  and  CALLISTUS. CALOCERUS  (St.)  M.  (April  18)  
(2nd  cent.)  An  official  under  the  Emperor Hadrian  at  Brescia  in  Lombardy,  who,  having witnessed  the  courage  with  which  SS.  Faustinus and  Jovita  went  to  their  death  for  Christ,  and the  miracles  which  ensued,  was  converted  to Christianity  and  baptised,  together  with  a great  number  of  other  Pagans.  Arrested  at Brescia  in  his  turn  as  a  Christian,  he  was  there put  to  the  torture,  but  was  afterwards  taken to  Albenga  in  Liguria,  and  beheaded  near  that town.  His  relics  are  now  at  Chiavaz,  not  far from  Turin. CALOCERUS  and  PARTHENIUS  (May  19)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  Two  Christians  in  the  service  of 
56 

iEmilianus,  a  man  of  Consular  rank,  and charged  by  him  with  the  duty  of  distributing after  his  death  his  superfluous  wealth  among the  poor.  They  appear  to  have  passed  into the  service  of  the  Emperor  Decius,  who  under pretext  of  safeguarding  the  interests  of  Anatolia, daughter  of  iEmilian,  imprisoned  them  and  put them  to  the  torture.  In  the  end  they  were beheaded  as  Christians  in  the  persecution  of a.d.  250.  Their  remains  were  reverently interred  by  Anatolia  in  the  Roman  Catacombs.  

CALOGERUS  THE  ANCHORET  (St.)  (June  18) (5th  cent.)  A  Greek  who,  with  the  blessing of  the  then  Pope,  retired  to  a  hermitage  near Girgenti  in  Sicily,  and  there  for  thirty-five years  led  a  life  of  prayer  and  penance.  He  was renowned  for  the  power  of  casting  out  devils, bestowed  upon  him  by  Almighty  God.  He  died about  the  year  486,  and  his  hermitage  became  a frequented  place  of  pilgrimage.

See  SS.  LUXORIUS,  CISELLUS, &c.  

CAMILLUS  DE  LELLIS  (St.)  (July  14)  
(17th  cent.)  A  native  of  the  Abruzzi  in Southern  Italy,  born  a.d.  1550,  who  after  some years  of  a  worldly  life,  strove  to  enter  the Franciscan  Order,  but  ultimately  found  his vocation  in  the  service  of  the  sick.  With  this in  view  he  formed  a  pious  association,  of  which the  members  worked  in  the  Hospital  of  the Incurables  in  Rome.  This  later  developed  into a  Religious  Order,  and  was  approved  as  such in  1591.  St.  Camillus,  who  had  been  ordained priest  by  Thomas  Goldwell  of  St.  Asaph,  the last  of  the  old  English  Bishops,  despite  his  own sufferings  from  a  painful  malady,  persevered  in the  service  of  the  sick  and  dying  till  his  death in  1614  at  the  age  of  sixty-four.  He  was canonised  a.d.  1746,  and  by  Leo  XIII  declared a  Patron  Saint  of  the  infirm.  

♦CAMILLUS  and  OTHERS  (Bl.)  MM.  (Oct.  12) (17th  cent.)  Blessed  Camillus  Costanzi  was an  Italian  Jesuit,  a  missionary  in  Japan,  where he  was  burned  to  death  for  the  Faith  of  Christ (a.d.  1622),  together  with  others — native converts,  among  them  being  two  little  children.  

♦CAMIN  of  INNISKELTRA  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  25) (7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who  founded  a monastery  on  an  island  in  Lough  Derg.  He was  a  learned  man  and  wrote  a  Commentary on  the  Hebrew  text  of  the  Psalms.  He  died A.D.  653.  

CAMPANIA  (MARTYRS  OF).  (March  2)  
(6th  cent.)  Catholics  put  to  death  as  such by  the  Arian  Lombards  while  ravaging  Italy. The  numbers  are  variously  estimated,  but amount  to  several  hundreds.  Concerning  their claims  to  the  honours  proper  to  Martyrs,  we have  the  favourable  witness  of  Pope  St.  Gregory the  Great,  their  contemporary.

(Date  unknown.)  One  of  a  group  of  Martyrs who  suffered  on  the  Ostian  Way,  outside  the gates  of  Rome,  in  the  ages  of  persecution,  and whose  relics  were  collected  and  enshrined  in the  Church  of  St.  Praxedes  by  Pope  St.  Paschal I  in  the  ninth  century.  In  inscriptions,  St. Candida  is  sometimes  styled  Virgin  Martyr, sometimes  simply  Martyr.  Nothing  is  known of  her  individually.  

CANDIDA  THE  ELDER  (St.)  (Sept.  4)  
(1st  cent.)  An  aged  woman  who  hospitably welcomed  St.  Peter  the  Apostle,  when  passing through  Naples  on  his  way  to  Rome.  By  him she  was  miraculously  cured  of  a  malady  from which  she  was  suffering.  She  herself  was instrumental  in  the  conversion  of  St.  Asprenus, who  afterwards  became  first  Bishop  of  Naples, and  who  gave  her  honourable  burial  at  her death,  which  happened  about  a.d.  78. 
CARADOC 

CANDIDA  THE  YOUNGER  (St.)  (Sept.  4)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  woman  of  Naples  who sacrificed  herself  persistingly  in  labouring  to ensure  the  corporal  and  spiritual  well-being  of her  husband  and  son,  and  whose  sanctity Almighty  God  bore  witness  to  by  the  many miracles  wrought  at  her  tomb,  from  which  oil flows  that  imparts  health  to  the  sick.  a.d.  586 appears  to  have  been  the  date  of  her  death. CANDIDA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  20)  
(3rd  cent.)  Stated  in  the  Roman  Martyrology to  have  suffered  at  Carthage  under  the  Emperor Maximinian  Herculeus,  Diocletian's  colleague  ; that  is,  towards  the  close  of  the  third  century. But  there  is  well-founded  doubt  as  to  the authenticity  of  the  record  on  which  the  entry, as  regards  the  date,  is  based.  For  the  controversy the  Acta  Sanctoru  may  be  consulted. CANDIDA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  1)

Kilkenny,  which  is  named  after  him.  He  was 
born  in  the  North  of  Ireland,  and  with  many 
other  holy  men  was  trained  to  the  monastic 
life  by  St.  Finnian  of  Cluain  or  Clonard,  passing 
afterwards  under  the  discipline  of  St.  Cadoc  of 
Wales.  He  preached  throughout  Ireland,  and 
also  in  Scotland,  where  he  was  the  first  to  build 
a  church  in  the  place  now  known  as  St.  Andrews.  

In Ireland he founded several monasteries, 
among  them  that  of  Aghadoe,  where  he  passed

♦CANNERA  (CAINDER,  KINNERA)  (Jan.  28) (St.)  V.  

(6th  cent.)  From  her  earliest  years,  St. Cannera  dedicated  her  virginity  to  God,  and lived  in  solitude  near  Bantry.  Receiving  a supernatural  revelation  of  St.  Senan's  sanctity, she  sought  him  out,  and  having  received  Holy Communion  at  his  hands,  placidly  passed  to  a better  life  about  a.d.  530.

(3rd  cent.)  Two  brothers  and  their  sister of  the  noble  Roman  family  of  the  Anicii,  who, with their tutor Protus, were denounced as 

Christians  and  arrested  at  Aquileia,  whither they  had  repaired  to  visit  in  his  prison  the holy  priest  St.  Chrysogonus.  They,  like  him, sealed  the  confession  of  their  Faith  with  their blood  (a.d.  290).

(11th  cent.)  The  son  of  Sweyn,  King  of Denmark,  and  great  nephew  of  Canute,  King  of England.  Succeeding  to  the  Danish  throne as  Canute  IV,  he  showed  himself  an  able  and warlike  monarch.  He  thoroughly  established the  Christian  religion  in  Denmark,  and  propagated it  through  the  Baltic  Provinces  of Courland  and  Livonia.  He  married  Alice  of Flanders  and  had  by  her  a  son,  St.  Charles  the Good,  Count  of  Flanders.  One  of  his  enterprises, which,  however,  failed,  was  the  fitting out  of  a  fleet  to  free  the  Anglo-Saxons  from the  Norman  yoke.  Though  beloved  by  his people,  he  was  cruelly  murdered  in  a  church  by a  party  of  malcontents,  headed  by  his  own brother,  Olaus  (a.d.  1084).  King  Eric  III, one  of  his  successors,  obtained  from  Rome  the decree  for  his  canonisation. "■CANUTE  LAVARD  (St.)  King,  M.  (Jan.  7)  
(12th  cent.)  A  nephew  of  St.  Canute,  King of  Denmark,  with  whom  he  is  sometimes confused.  From  being  Duke  of  Schleswig,  he became  King  of  the  Sclavi.  He  ruled  justly and  wisely,  winning  the  love  of  his  subjects. He  was  done  to  death  by  a  kinsman  of  his, a  pretender  to  his  throne  (a.d.  1133),  and  in Scandinavia  is  honoured  as  a  Martyr. CAPITO  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (March  4)

(4th  cent.)  A  number  of  Asiatic  Christians put  to  death  for  their  religion  by  Galerius, colleague  of  the  Emperor  Diocletian  (a.d.  303). As  in  other  cases,  the  Ecclesiastical  Chronicles put  much  stress  on  the  frightful  tortures  to which  they  were  subjected,  to  try  their  Faith previous  to  their  execution. CAPRASIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  1)  
(5th  cent.)  Styled  by  Eucherius  "  a  man  of venerable  gravity,  the  equal  of  the  ancient Fathers."  He  with  his  brothers,  SS.  Honoratus  and  Venantius,  went  from  Gaul  to  Greece to  study  and  to  practise  the  monastic  life.  After the  death  of  Venantius,  Caprasius  and  Honoratus  returned  to  Gaul  and  founded  the  celebrated monastery  of  the  Isle  of  Lerins.  On  the promotion  of  Honoratus  to  the  See  of  Aries, Caprasius  succeeded  him  as  Abbot.  He  died A.D.  430. CAPRASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  29)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Agen  in  the  South of  France,  who,  to  escape  the  fury  of  the persecution  set  on  foot  by  Diocletian,  or  rather by  Maximinian  Herculeus,  had  concealed  himself in  the  neighbouring  hills  ;  but  on  hearing of  the  courage  of  St.  Faith  at  the  stake,  came forth  and  boldly  confessed  that  he  also  was  a Christian.  With  others  he  was  beheaded a.d.  303,  and  his  relics  were  later  enshrined  in a  church  dedicated  in  his  honour. *  CARADOC  (St.)  (April  13)

(5th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Prince  who  laboured under  St.  Patrick  in  the  Evangelisation  of Ireland  in  the  fifth  century.  The  two  Saints, Cairnach  (Carnath)  and  Carantog,  are  by  some identified,  by  others  looked  upon  as  two  distinct personages.  One  of  them  has  left  his  name  to Llangrannog  (Cardigan).  But  it  is  difficult  to disentangle  the  various  traditions.
♦CARANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  24)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Saint  commemorated  in  the Aberdeen  Breviary.  He  belonged  to  the  East of  Scotland,  and  has  been  thought  to  be  no other  than  the  Corindus  who  died  among  the Picts,  a.d.  669. CARAUNUS  (CHERON)  (St.)  M.  (May  28)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth  who  embraced the  Christian  Faith  in  the  Apostolic  Age. The  tradition  is  that  he  was  ordained  deacon, and  having  gone  to  Gaul  as  a  missionary, suffered  martyrdom  near  Chartres  under Domitian  (A.D.  98).
♦CARILEPHUS  (CARILEFF,  CALAIS)  (July  1) (St.)  Abbot.  

(6th  cent.)  A  French  monk,  friend  and companion  of  St.  Avitus,  and  founder  of  a monastery  of  very  strict  observance  in  Maine. He  died  a.d.  540  or  542.  His  cult  is  chiefly at  Blois. CARINA  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  7)

(6th  cent.)  By  some  thought  to  be  identical with  St.  Carantog  or  Cairnech ;  by  others distinguished  from  him.  In  the  latter  case  he would  be  the  Irish  Saint  whom  tradition  alleges to  have  been  Abbot  or  Bishop  of  some  Ecclesiastical establishment  in  the  neighbourhood  of Lough  Foyle.

(4th  cent.)  Three  brothers  who,  with  their sister,  St.  Fortunata,  were  among  the  Christians seized  and  put  to  death  at  Csesarea  in  Palestine under  Diocletian  (a.d.  303  or  304).  Their  relics were  afterwards  translated  to  Naples. CARPOPHORUS,  EXANTHUS,  CASSIUS,  SEVERINUS,  SECUNDUS  and  LICINIUS  (SS.)  MM.  

(Aug.  7)  
(3rd  cent.) Christian  soldiers  who  were  put

(3rd  cent.)  A  priest  and  his  deacon,  two among  the  many  thousands  who  suffered  death as  Christians  in  the  persecution  organised  by the  Emperor  Diocletian.  The  date  of  their martyrdom  is  placed  by  modern  authorities  at some  year  between  A.D.  290  and  A.D.  300.  The place,  whether  in  Rome  itself,  or  at  Spoleto, or  even  in  Spain,  is  much  disputed. 58 

CARPUS,  PAPYLUS,  AGATHONICA  and  AGATHODORUS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  group  of  Martyrs  of  Pergamus in  Asia  Minor.  Probably  they  suffered  in  the persecution  under  Decius  (a.d.  250),  though some  ante-date  them  by  a  century  to  the  time of  the  Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius.  Carpus  was the  Bishop  of  Thyatira,  Papylus,  his  deacon, Agathonica,  the  latter's  sister,  and  Agathodorus, their  servant.  

CARPUS  (St.)  (Oct.  13)  
(1st  cent.)  The  Carpus  of  Troas  on  the Hellespont  with  whom  St.  Paul  (1  Tim.,  iv.  13) says  "  he  had  left  his  cloak."  Nothing  about him  is  known  with  any  certainty,  though  various Greek  authors  make  him  a  Bishop,  some  of Berea,  some  of  Berytus,  some  of  Crete.  

♦CARTHAGE  THE  ELDER  (St.)  Bp.  (March  5) (6th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Kieran  in the  See  of  Ossory.  He  is  said  to  have  been  son or  grandson  of  King  iEngus,  but  we  have  no reliable  account  of  his  life.  a.d.  540  is  given by  some  as  the  year  of  his  death.  

♦CARTHAGE  THE  YOUNGER  (St.)  Bp.  (May  14) (7th  cent.)  This  Saint,  whose  real  name appears  to  have  been  Mochuda,  was  born  in Kerry  in  the  first  half  of  the  sixth  century, and  attached  himself  to  St.  Carthage  of  Ossory. After  this  teacher,  he  had  as  his  Abbot  St. Comgall  of  Benchor,  and  was  soon  himself placed  at  the  head  of  a  monastery  in  which  he ruled  over  a  thousand  monks.  His  Abbey developed  into  the  famous  Bishopric  and  school of  Lismore.  He  passed  away  at  the  age  of ninety,  about  A.D.  638.  

CARTHERIUS,  STYRIACUS,  TOBIAS,  EUDOXIUS, AGAPIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  2) (4th  cent.)  Ten  Christians,  soldiers  in  the army  of  the  Emperor  Licinius,  burned  to  death at  the  stake  at  Sebaste  in  Armenia  (a.d.  315 about),  for  refusing  to  sacrifice  with  their  pagan comrades  to  the  Roman  gods.  

♦CARTHUSIAN  MARTYRS  (Bl.)  (May  4)  
(16th  cent.)  They  are  eighteen  in  number, namely,  in  the  first  place,  John  Houghton, Prior  of  the  London  Charterhouse,  Robert Laurence,  Prior  of  Beauvale  in  Nottinghamshire, Augustine  Webster,  Prior  of  Axholme  in Lincolnshire,  who  were  executed  at  Tyburn, May  4,  1538.  Shortly  afterwards,  at  York, eleven  others  of  the  brethren  were  done  to death.  They  are  John  Rochester,  James Walworth,  John  or  Richard  Bere,  Thomas Johnson,  Thomas  Greenway  or  Green,  all priests  ;  John  Davies,  deacon  ;  William  Greenwood, Thomas  Scriven,  Robert  Salt,  Walter Pierson,  Thomas  Redyng,  lay-brothers.  Blessed William  Exmew,  Humphrey  Middlemore  and Sebastian  Newdigate  of  the  London  Charterhouse had  been  put  to  death  long  before  (June 18,  1535).  Blessed  William  Home  shared  the captivity  of  the  rest,  but  was  spared  to  be brought  to  execution  at  a  later  period  (Aug.  4, 1540).  These  holy  men  of  one  accord  laid  down their  lives  rather  than  swerve  at  the  behest of  Henry  VIII  from  the  Faith  of  their  Fathers.

CASIMIR  of  POLAND  (St.)  (March  4)  
(15th  cent.)  The  second  son  of  Casimir  IV, King  of  Poland,  distinguished  from  his  boyhood for  piety  and  charity  to  the  poor.  On  coming to  man's  estate  he  refused  the  crown  of  Hungary, pressed  upon  him  by  his  own  father  and  by  a powerful  party  among  the  Hungarians,  dissatisfied with  their  reigning  monarch.  He  died (a.d.  1482)  before  reaching  his  twenty-fifth  year. On  his  deathbed  he  asked  that  a  copy  of  his well-known  Hymn  to  Our  Blessed  Lady  should be  buried  with  him  at  Cracow.  Many  miracles were  wrought  at  his  tomb,  and  in  1552  his  body was  found  to  be  still  incorrupt.  He  was canonised  by  Pope  Leo  X.

CASSIAN  of  AUTUN  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  Probably  an  Egyptian  by  birth. Coming  to  Autun  in  France,  lie  attached  himself to  St.  Reticius,  the  then  Bishop,  whom  he eventually  succeeded  in  the  See.  He  governed the  Diocese  of  Autun  for  about  twenty  years, and  died  a.d.  350.  Many  miracles,  of  which some  have  been  put  upon  record  by  St.  Gregory of  Tours,  preserved  to  him  the  affection  of  his people,  who  in  his  lifetime  had  been  devoted to  him.  

CASSIAN  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Martyr  of  Imola  in  Central Italy,  especially  famous  on  account  of  the repulsive  features  of  his  Passion.  He  was  a schoolmaster,  and  on  being  denounced  as  a Christian,  was  condemned  to  perish  at  the  hands of  his  hundred  pupils.  These  boys  pierced  him to  death  with  their  styli  (steel  pencils  used  for writing  on  wax).  St.  Cassian  suffered  in  one  of the  persecutions  of  the  third  century,  but  in which  cannot  be  assigned  with  any  certainty.  

CASSIAN  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  13)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Todi  in  Central Italy,  successor  in  that  See  of  St.  Pontianus who  had  converted  him  to  Christianity.  He won  the  crown  of  martyrdom  under  Maximian Herculeus  at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth century ;  but  the  traditions  concerning  him have  been  confused  with  those  relating  to  the more  famous  St.  Cassian  of  Imola,  so  that particulars  cannot  be  now  given  with  any confidence.  He  is  still  in  great  veneration  at Todi,  where  his  relics  are  enshrined  with  those of  other  local  Martyrs.  

CASSIAN  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  celebrated  African  Martyr  of Tangiers  who  suffered  in  the  great  persecution under  Diocletian,  or  rather  in  the  years  immediately preceding  (a.d.  298).  His  Acts, edited  by  Ruinart,  have  escaped  interpolation and  he  is  mentioned  in  one  of  the  Hymns  of the  Christian  poet  Prudentius.  He  was  the "  exceptor  "  (clerk  or  recorder)  of  the  court of  the  Praetorian  Prefect,  and  during  the  trial of  St.  Marcellus  the  Martyr  threw  down  his  pen and  declared  himself  a  Christian,  with  the result  that  he  was  privileged  to  share  the glorious  fate  of  that  Saint.

(3rd  cent.)  In  the  year  260,  Chrocas,  the Pagan  chief  of  the  Alemanni,  a  tribe  of  Teutonic barbarians,  overran  Roman  Gaul  and  put  to the  sword  its  inhabitants,  already  in  no  small part  Christians.  At  Clermont  in  Auvergne no  fewer  than  6266  of  these  are  said  to  have perished,  and  have  ever  since  been  honoured as  Martyrs.  Among  them  were  Cassius,  a priest,  and  Victorinus,  one  of  his  converts.  

CASSIUS  of  NARNI  (St.)  Bp.  (June  29)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  prelate,  Bishop  of  Narni, near  Spoleto.  In  his  lifetime  he  gave  all  he possessed  to  the  poor.  He  let  no  day  pass without  celebrating  Mass  "with  compunction and  many  tears."  On  June  29,  558  (the  day he  had  himself  foretold),  he  yielded  up  his  soul to  God  at  the  moment  when,  having  communicated the  assistants  at  the  Holy  Sacrifice, he  was  dismissing  them  with  the  Kiss  of  Peace. His  shrine  is  in  Narni  Cathedral.

death  on  account  of  their  religion  at  Tarsus  in 

Cilicia in one of  the early persecutions. A third  Menelampus  is  added  by  some  authors. CASTOR  and  STEPHEN  (SS.)  MM.  (April  27)  
(Date  unknown.)  Two  Christians  registered in  the  Martyrologies  as  having  suffered  martyrdom at  Tarsus  in  Cilicia.  Dates  and  particulars are  lost.  But  it  does  not  appear  that  there  are any  substantial  grounds  for  the  identification of  these  Saints  with  the  SS.  Castor  and  Dorotheus  of  March  28,  as  is  suggested  by  some modern  authorities.  At  Tarsus  there  were many  Martyrs,  and  Castor  is  quite  a  common name  among  Asiatic  Greeks. CASTOR,  VICTOR  and  ROGATIANUS  (Dec.  28)

See the HOLY FOUR CROWNED MARTYRS. CASTRENSIS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  11)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  Catholic  Bishops banished  from  Africa  in  the  fifth  century  by the  Arian  Vandals.  Landing  in  Italy,  he became  Bishop  of  Capua,  or  at  least  worked as  a  Bishop  in  that  Diocese.  Part  of  his  relics are  at  Capua  and  part  at  Monreale  in  Sicily. There  is  much  dispute  as  to  precise  dates. Some  would  have  him  to  be  identical  with Priscus,  Episcopus  Castrensis,  who  died  A.d.  459, and  is  venerated  on  Sept.  1.  Others  put  his exile  under  Thrasimund  between  the  years  496 and  522.  There  was  a  Candidianus,  Bishop of  Castra,  banished  from  Africa  in  the  year  484. He  would  have  been  styled  Episcopus  Castrensis, and  it  is  not  impossible  that  he  may  be  the St.  "  Castrensis  "  of  the  Martyrologies. CASTRENSIS  (St.)  (Sept.  1)

(2nd  cent.)  The  predecessor  of  St.  Calimerus in  the  See  of  Milan.  He  was  famous  for  his care  of  the  poor  and  of  travellers.  He  restored the  Milanese  Church  ravaged  by  the  persecutions under  the  Emperors  Domitian  and  Trajan. He  passed  away,  illustrious  for  his  piety  and  for his  miracles,  a.d.  137,  in  the  forty-second  year of  his  Episcopate. CASTULUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  12)

(3rd  cent.)  An  officer  or  chamberlain  of  the palace  in  Rome  of  the  Emperor  Diocletian. For  having  sheltered  some  of  his  fellow  Christians,  he  was  seized,  put  to  the  torture, and  in  the  end  buried  alive  (a.d.  288). CASTULUS  and  EUPREPIS  (SS.)  MM. (Nov.  3)  
(Date  unknown.)  Roman  martyrs  registered

CASTUS  and  /EMILIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  Two  celebrated  African  Martyrs of  the  persecution  of  Decius  (a.d.  250)  who, having  first  given  way  when  put  to  the  torture, repented,  and  on  being  seized  a  second  time, bravely  won  their  crown.  They  were  burned to  death,  their  love  of  Christ,  as  their  contemporary St.  Cyprian  tells  us,  proving  itself "  stronger  than  fire."  One  of  St.  Augustine's sermons  is  a  panegyric  of  these  holy  men. CASTUS  and  SECUNDINUS  (SS.)  Bps.,  (July  1)  

MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  Two  Saints  much  venerated in  various  churches  of  Southern  Italy, and  celebrated  by  several  Mediaeval  authors. The  Martyrologies  register  them  as  of  Sinuessa (Mondragone)  near  Caserta.  St.  Castus  is  often written  St.  Cassius.  A  Bishop  Secundinus assisted  at  the  Council  of  Sinuessa  a.d.  304. Detailed  accounts  of  them  were  written  some fifteen  hundred  years  ago,  but  the  Bollandists and  other  modern  authorities  put  little  faith in  their  accuracy.

(7th  cent.)  The  most  illustrious  of  the several  Irish  Saints  of  that  name.  Born  in Munster  he  became  the  disciple  and  successor of  St.  Carthage  in  the  famous  School  of  Lismore. He  is  believed  to  have  been  consecrated  a  Bishop in  Ireland.  But  on  his  return  from  a  pilgrimage to  the  Holy  Land,  the  people  of  Taranto  in Southern  Italy  constrained  him  to  accept  the government  of  tbeir  Church.  Many  miracles are  attributed  to  his  intercession.  He  flourished early  in  the  seventh  century.

CATHAN  (CAT AN,  CADAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (May  17) (6th  cent.)  This  Saint  who  flourished  in  the sixth  or  possibly  in  the  seventh  century  appears to  have  been  a  Bishop  in  the  Isle  of  Bute, often  called  after  him  Kil-cathan.  He  was, it  is  said,  Irish  by  birth,  and  the  uncle  of  St. Blane.  Colgan  says  that  he  died  after  a.d.  560, and  his  tomb  is  shown  at  Tamlacht  near  Londonderry. The  Scots  contend  that  he  rests  in  the Isle  of  Bute.  It  is  possible  that  there  may have  been  two  Saints  of  the  name.  

CATHARINE  DEI  RICCI  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  2)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Florentine  maiden  of  the ancient  family  of  the  Ricci,  born  a.d.  1519, and  who,  at  the  age  of  fourteen,  entered  a convent  of  the  Third  Order  of  St.  Dominic  at Prato,  near  Florence,  of  which  she  after  some years  became  Prioress.  Humble  and  meek  of heart,  she  was  wonderful  for  her  spirit  of penance,  and  emulated  in  her  life  the  austerities of  the  ancient  solitaries.  A  marvellous  meeting in  vision  of  St.  Philip  Neri  and  St.  Catharine  is narrated  of  them.  Three  Cardinals,  afterwards Popes,  were  among  the  thousands  who  flocked to  Prato  to  ask  the  prayers  of  the  poor  nun. Her  Heavenly  Spouse  called  her  to  Himself, Feb.  2,  1589.  She  was  canonised  by  Benedict XIV,  A.D.  1746.

Of  a  noble  family  of  Bologna, this  Saint,  after  living  some  years  as  a  Franciscan Tertiary  at  Ferrara,  became  Abbess  of  a  newly founded  and  very  austere  monastery  of  Poor Clares  at  Bologna.  Her  life  may  be  said  to have  been  passed  in  making  intercession  for the  conversion  of  sinners  and  for  the  salvation of  men.  Endued  with  the  gifts  of  prophecy and  miracles,  she  bore  her  many  trials  with heroic  patience  and  cheerfulness.  She  passed from  this  world  March  9,  1463,  at  the  age  of fifty,  and  her  holy  body  remains  incorrupt to  this  day.  She  has  left  various  ascetical writings  of  great  value.  Canonised  in  the eighteenth  century,  she  is  regarded  as  one  of the  Patron  Saints  of  painters,  in  whose  art she  was  skilled.  

CATHARINE  of  SWEDEN  (St.)  V.  (March  22)  
(14th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  Ulpho,  Prince of  Nericia,  and  of  his  wife,  St.  Bridget  of Sweden,  Catharine,  betrothed  to  Egard,  a  young nobleman,  persuaded  him  to  join  with  her  in making  a  vow  of  chastity.  She  accompanied her  mother  on  many  pilgrimages,  and  like  her, everywhere  showed  herself  zealous  for  God's glory  and  for  the  salvation  of  souls.  After  her mother's  death  in  Rome  she  returned  to  Sweden, and  died  in  fame  of  great  sanctity,  Abbess  of Wadstena,  a.d.  1381.  Thirty  years  after  her death,  Ulpho,  a  Bridgettine  Friar,  wrote  her  life. Some  ascetical  works  of  her  own  are  extant.  

CATHARINE  of  GENOA  (St.)  Widow.  (March  22) (16th  cent.)  Catharine  Fieschi,  of  a  noble Genoese  family,  was  married  to  Julian  Adorno, of  rank  equal  to  her  own.  Misunderstood  and disliked  by  her  husband,  she  passed  years  of  a wretched  life,  upheld  only  by  her  piety  and  by her  trust  in  God.  At  length  her  prayers  and 60 

her  devotedness  to  him  won  Adorno  back  to  a good  life,  closed  by  a  holy  death.  Catharine then  gave  herself  up  to  the  service  of  the  sick and  of  the  poor,  passing  away  at  the  age  of sixty-three,  Sept.  15,  1510.  Her  virtues  and the  supernatural  heights  of  prayer  to  which  it pleased  Almighty  God  to  raise  her,  together with  the  miracles  wrought  in  favour  of  those who  sought  her  intercession,  led  to  her  canonisation by  Clement  XII  (a.d.  1737).  

CATHARINE  of  SIENA  (St.)  V.  (April  30)  
(14th  cent.)  Born  at  Siena  in  Tuscany (A.D.  1347)  of  a  family  of  good  repute,  the Benincasa,  Catharine  was  favoured  with  supernatural graces  by  Almighty  God  from  her  very childhood.  At  the  age  of  eighteen  she  received the  habit  of  the  Third  Order  of  St.  Dominic, and  thenceforth  lived  a  wonderful  life  of  prayer and  penance,  crowned  by  God  with  the  gift of  the  Stigmata,  as  was  that  of  St.  Francis  of Assisi.  She  was  indefatigable  in  her  service  of the  poor,  especially  of  the  plague-stricken, but  her  zeal  was  chiefly  directed  to  obtaining the  conversion  of  sinners  and  to  securing  the peace  of  the  Church  in  Italy,  her  fatherland. By  her  visit  to  Avignon,  she  was  instrumental in  bringing  about  the  return  of  the  Popes  to Rome,  and  later  on,  laboured,  though  in  vain, to  avert  the  Great  Schism  between  the  Faithful and  the  adherents  of  the  rival  Pope  of  Avignon. She  died  in  Rome,  April  30,  a.d.  1380,  and  was canonised  in  1461.  Her  body  rests  in  the Minerva  Church  in  Rome,  of  which  city  she  is reckoned  one  of  the  Patron  Saints.  Her "  Dialogue  "  and  other  writings  will  always  be a  treasure-house  of  mystic  lore  to  the  prayerful. Countless  miracles  have  been  wrought  by  her intercession,  and  personal  devotion  to  her  is widespread  tliroughout  the  Church.  

CATHARINE  (St.)  V.M.  (Nov.  25)  
(4th  cent.)  A  rich  and  noble  as  well  as cultured  and  intellectually  gifted  maiden  of Alexandria  in  Egypt,  who,  contemning  the overtures  of  the  tyrant  Maximinus  Daza,  was after  much  persecution  sent  into  exile.  On her  return  the  tradition  is  that  she  was  put  to death  (a.d.  310)  after  vain  attempts  to  torture her  into  submission  to  heathenism,  by  means of  an  engine  fitted  with  a  spiked  wheel.  Her body  was  discovered  by  the  Christians  in  Egypt and  reverently  interred  among  them.  But  the tradition  goes  on  to  recount  how  in  the  eighth century  angels  conveyed  it  to  the  top  of  Mount Sinai,  where  it  is  still  the  object  of  great  veneration. On  account  of  her  skill  and  success  in overthrowing  in  a  public  discussion  the  arguments of  the  Pagan  Sages  of  Alexandria,  St. Catharine  is  recognised  as  the  Patron  Saint  of Christian  philosophers.  But  very  little  is  in reality  known  about  her  life.  A  few  lines  in Eusebius  seem  to  be  a  chief  basis  of  tradition concerning  her,  or,  at  least,  a  witness  to  its genuineness.

At  length, touched  by  Divine  grace,  he  resolved  to  become a  Christian,  and  journeyed  to  Rome,  where  he was  baptised  by  Pope  St.  Sergius,  and  dying, while  yet  wearing  the  white  robe  of  a  neophyte (a.d.  689),  was  on  that  account  numbered  among the  Saints.

Set  at liberty,  he  returned  to  Carthage,  his  native  city, and  was  there  ordained  deacon  by  St.  Cyprian.

Ceolfrid  is famous  as  the  teacher  of  the  Venerable  Bede, who  has  written  his  life.  He  was  learned  and a  persevering  student,  as  well  as  a  man  of wonderful  holiness  of  life.  He  died  on  a pilgrimage  to  Rome  (A.d.  716),  at  Langres  in France,  whence  his  sacred  remains  were  afterwards restored  to  Jarrow.

(Date unknown.)  A  Bishop of Verona, 
praised  by  his  successors  for  his  zeal  and  piety,

CESLAS  (St.)  (July  20)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Polish  Saint  who  received, together  with  St.  Hyacinth,  the  habit  of  the Order  of  St.  Dominic  from  the  hands  of  the holy  founder  himself.  He  acted  as  Spiritual Director  to  the  Duchess  St.  Hedwige,  besides rendering  in  other  ways  important  services to  the  Church.  The  successful  resistance  of  the citizens  of  Breslau  in  Silesia,  where  he  resided, to  the  Mongols  in  their  great  invasion  of  1240, is  attributed  to  his  prayers  and  miracles.  He went  to  his  reward  in  July,  1242. *CETTIN  (CETHACH)  (St.)  Bp.  (June  16)

varying.  

CHAD  (CEADDA)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  2)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon,  brother  of St.  Cedd,  Bishop  of  London.  He  was  educated at  Lindisfarne  and  in  Ireland.  He  governed for  some  years  the  monastery  of  Lestingay  in Yorkshire,  acquiring  thereby  a  great  reputation for  ability  and  for  holiness  of  life.  Through  a mistake  occasioned  by  the  prolonged  absence of  St.  Wilfrid  in  France,  St.  Chad  was  consecrated Archbishop  of  York  in  his  place  ;  but on  the  Saint's  return  passed  to  the  Bishopric of  the  Mercians,  of  which  he  fixed  the  See  at Lichfield.  He  died  two  years  later  in  the  great pestilence  of  A.D.  673,  leaving  an  imperishable memory  for  zeal  and  devoted  ness.

See  SS.  CAIUS,  FAUSTUS, &c. CH^REMON  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  Chseremon,  Bishop  of  Nilopolis, had  reached  a  very  advanced  age  when,  in  the Decian  persecution  (A.D.  250),  he  was  forced from  Egypt  and  compelled  to  take  refuge  in  the mountains  about  Sinai,  where  he  was  done  to death  by  the  savage  heathens  of  the  desert. St.  Dionysius  of  Alexandria  states  that  he  was the  leader  in  their  flight  of  a  number  of  Christians of  his  flock,  of  whom  the  greater  part  were immolated  with  him. CHALCEDON  (MARTYRS  OF).  (Sept.  24)  
(4th  cent.)  Forty-nine  Christians  put  to death  on  account  of  their  religion  in  the  great persecution  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  304).  They are  styled  the  "  Martyrs  of  Chalcedon."  They appear  to  have  been  the  choir  of  singers  of  the great  church  of  Chalcedon,  and  suffered  in company  with  or  a  few  days  after  the  celebrated VirginMartyr,  Euphemia.
♦CHAMOND  (ANNEMOND)  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.  28)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Lyons,  of noble  family,  brought  up  at  the  Court  of  King Clovis  II.  He  governed  his  Diocese  with  zeal and  success,  but  in  the  end  fell  a  victim  to  the machinations  of  Ebroin,  Mayor  of  the  Palace, who  caused  him  to  be  assassinated  (A.D.  657). Among  those  who  took  part  in  the  ceremony of  the  enshrining  of  the  Relics  of  this  holy Martyr  was  St.  Wilfrid  of  York. 62

The  similarity  of name  and  of  many  of  the  details  of  martyrdom have  led  some  moderns  to  confuse  St.  Charitina with  St.  Catharine  of  Alexandria,  but  all tradition  is  against  their  view.

(9th  cent.)  The  famous  Charles  the  Great, son  of  Pepin  the  Short,  born  in  742,  a  successful warrior,  who,  conquering  the  Lombards  and Saxons,  and  securing  to  the  Popes  their  temporal kingdom,  was  God's  instrument  for  the  advancement of  Christianity.  He  was  zealous  for Church  discipline  and  for  the  spread  of  learning. He  cared  for  the  poor  and  was  eminently  pious, meditating  much  on  the  Holy  Scriptures. Pope  St.  Leo  III  crowned  him  Emperor  of Rome  and  the  West,  on  Christmas  Day,  A.D. 800.  He  died  at  Aix-la-Chapelle,  Jan.  28, A.D.  814,  and  in  some  churches  has  been  honoured as  a  Saint.

♦CHARLES  THE  GOOD  (St.)  M.  (March  2)  
(12th  cent.)  An  Earl  of  Flanders,  son  of St.  Canute,  King  of  Denmark,  and  a  perfect model  of  a  Christian  ruler.  His  government was  wise  and  kindly,  and  he  was  adored  by  his subjects.  His  boundless  charity  to  the  poor earned  him  the  title  of  "  The  Good."  He  was murdered  by  certain  Governors  of  towns  whose oppression  of  their  people  he  had  refused  to tolerate.  His  martyrdom  came  to  pass  in  the church  of  St.  Donatian  at  Bruges,  A.D.  1124.
♦CHARLES  SPINOLA  and  OTHERS (Sept.  11)  
(Bl.)  MM.  

(17th  cent.)  Twelve  holy  Martyrs  (a.d.  1622) of  the  Society  of  Jesus  at  Nangazaki  in  Japan, in  which  country  Bl.  Charles  had  laboured  for twenty  years  as  a  missionary.  With  them suffered  many  native  Christians,  among  whom were  even  children. CHARLES  BORROMEO  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  4)  
(16th  cent.)  Of  an  ancient  Lombard  family, born  near  Milan  (A.D.  1538).  When  only  a youth  rich  Ecclesiastical  preferment  was bestowed  upon  him  ;  and  at  the  age  of  twentythree  he  was  made  Archbishop  of  Milan  and Cardinal,  by  his  uncle,  Pope  Pius  IV.  In  an age  of  lax  discipline  he  was  a  model  of  austere virtue,  living  a  life  of  penance  and  prayer, zealously  visiting  his  Diocese  and  scrupulously employing  his  revenues  for  the  good  of  the Church  and  of  the  poor.  Much  of  the  success of  the  Council  of  Trent  is  due  to  his  indefatigable labours  in  the  cause  of  reform.  Evildoers  on one  occasion  all  but  assassinated  him.  His devotedness  to  his  flock  during  the  Great Plague  of  1576  made  him  almost  worshipped by  the  Milanese.  He  went  to  his  reward, Nov.  4,  1584 ;  and  his  body  was  enshrined under  the  High  Altar  of  his  Cathedral.  He  was canonised  A.D.  1610. CHEF  (St.)  Abbot.  (Oct.  29)

From  Cuno,  Cardinal  of  Praeneste,  she  received the  Benedictine  habit  in  the  Abbey  Church  of St.  Scholastica,  but  continued  her  solitary  life of  prayer  and  penance  to  her  death  (a.d.  1138), when  her  soul  was  seen  ascending  to  Heaven by  several  persons,  including  Pope  Eugenius III,  then  at  Segni.  Her  body  now  reposes  in the  church  of  St.  Scholastica  at  Subiaco.

♦CHRISTIANA  (St.)  V.  (July  24)  
(7th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  the  daughter of  an  Anglo-Saxon  king.  She  crossed  over  to Flanders  and  there  lived  so  holy  a  life  that after  her  death  she  was  at  once  venerated  as a  Saint.  She  is  the  Patron  Saint  of  the  town of  Termonde  in  Belgium.  

CHRISTIANA  (St.)  V.  (Dec.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  who,  taken captive  by  the  Pagan  Iberi,  dwellers  between the  Caspian  and  the  Black  Sea,  and  reduced  to slavery,  kept  with  singular  fidelity  the  precepts of  her  religion.  Having  by  her  miracles  converted the  Royal  Family,  the  king  sent  ambassadors to  Constantine,  the  first  Christian Emperor,  asking  for  priests  to  complete  her work ;  and  they  on  their  arrival  had  little difficulty  in  bringing  the  whole  nation  under the  yoke  of  Christ.  As  is  plain,  this  Saint flourished  in  the  fourth  century  ;  but  her  very name  is  unknown,  Christiana  (the  Christian) being  merely  that  given  her  by  the  Iberi.  

♦CHRISTIANUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  18)  
(12th  cent.)  Such  reliable  information  as we  have  regarding  this  Saint  says  that  he  was the  first  Abbot  of  the  Cistercian  Order  in Ireland,  and  that  he  was  a  collateral  descendant of  St.  Malachy.  He  is  alleged  to  have  acted as  Papal  Legate  at  the  Council  of  Kells  (a.d. 1152).  

♦CHRISTIANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  12)  
(12th  cent.)  Croistan  O'Morgair,  brother  to St.  Malachy  of  Armagh.  He  was  made  Bishop of  Clogher  (a.d.  1126)  and  obtained  several favours  from  the  Holy  See  for  his  Diocese.  He died  a.d.  1138.

CHRISTINA  (St.)  V.M.  (March  13)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Persian  Martyr  who, from  the  Greek  Menology,  appears  to  have  been scourged  to  death.  Nothing  further  is  known of  her,  nor  can  even  an  approximate  date  be given.  

CHRISTINA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  24)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Roman  maiden  who, believing  in  Christ,  is  said  to  have  broken  up her  father's  idols  of  gold  and  silver,  and  given the  proceeds  of  their  sale  to  the  poor,  to  have been  on  that  account  scourged  by  him,  and  being brought  before  the  magistrate,  to  have  bravely endured  unheard-of  tortures  before  being  put to  death.  The  place  of  her  Passion  is  certainly the  Lacus  Vulsinus  (Lago  di  Bolsena)  in  Tuscany 

not  Tyre  in  the  East,  as  has  been  conjectured ; but  its  date  is  unknown.  Husenbeth  gives  no less  than  eleven  emblems  distinguishing  St. Christina's  pictures  and  statues  from  those  of other  Saints.  Arrows  carried  in  her  hand  are the  most  usual.

See  SS.  BENEDICT,  JOHN, &c.  

♦CHRISTINA  (St.)  V.  (July  24)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Belgian  Saint  who  lived  in the  neighbourhood  of  the  town  of  St.  Trond. Many  strange  legends  are  in  circulation  about her ;  but  she  appears  to  have  been  favoured with  many  supernatural  visions  and  to  have worked  many  miracles  both  in  life  and  after her  death  (a.d.  1224),  which  took  place  in  a convent  in  the  vicinity.  Her  shrine  is  in  a church  outside  St.  Trond.  

CHRISTOPHER  (CHRISTOBAL,  KESTER,  KITT) (St.)  M.  (July  25)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  convert  to  Christianity, baptised  by  St.  Babylas  of  Antioch,  and  put  to death  for  the  Faith  in  the  persecution  ordered by  the  Emperor  Decius  (a.d.  250).  St.  Christopher suffered  somewhere  in  the  Province  of Lycia  in  Asia  Minor.  He  was  a  popular  Saint during  the  Middle  Ages,  and  around  his  memory have  grown  up  many  legends,  the  most  beautiful of  which  is  that  of  his  carrying  an  unknown  child across  a  ford,  and  being  borne  down  by  its weight,  despite  his  own  gigantic  stature  and great  strength  ;  for  the  child  was  Christ,  carrying in  His  Hands  the  weight  of  the  whole  world. A  belief  that  whoso  looked  upon  the  face  of St.  Christopher  should  not  that  day  be  struck down  by  sudden  death,  led  to  the  frequent picturing  of  St.  Christopher  (the  Christ-Bearer) in  churches,  over  city-gates,  &c.  The  Greeks keep  his  Feast  on  May  9.

CHRODEGANG  (St.)  Bp.  (March  6)  
(8th  cent.)  A  noble  Frank,  Councillor  and Chancellor  of  Charles  Martel,  the  famous champion  of  Christendom  and  victor  of  Poitiers. After  the  death  of  Charles,  St.  Chrodegang became  Bishop  of  Metz.  He  met  and  escorted Pope  Stephen  III  when  the  latter  visited France,  and  undertook  for  him  a  mission  to  the king  of  the  Lombards.  His  zeal  for  Church discipline  was  remarkable  and  bore  much  fruit. The  wise  Rule  he  drew  up  for  the  government of  the  Canons  Regular  would  of  itself  serve  to perpetuate  his  memory.  He  died  March  6, A.D.  766.  

CHROMATIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  2)  
(5th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Valerian (a.d.  387)  in  the  See  of  Aquileia  near  Venice. He  was  a  zealous  Pastor  of  souls,  and  is  styled by  St.  Jerome,  who  dedicated  to  him  several of  his  workSj  "  a  most  learned  and  most  holy man."  He  is  eulogised  likewise  by  St.  John Chrysostom,  his  friend  and  contemporary, whom  he  defended  and  supported.  He  passed away  a.d.  406.  Of  his  numerous  works  only a  part  of  his  Commentary  on  St.  Matthew  has come  down  to  us.  

CHRONIDAS  (St.)  M.  (March  27)  

See  SS.  PHILETAS,  LYDIA, &c.  

♦CHROMATIUS  (St.)  (Aug.  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  father  of  St.  Tiburtius  the Martyr  (Aug.  11).  He  was  converted  to Christianity  by  St.  Tranquillinus,  who  was brought  before  Chromatius  at  a  time  when  the latter  was  discharging  the  functions  of  Prefect of  Rome.  Though  St.  Chromatius  did  not himself  win  the  crown  of  martyrdom  he  was looked  upon  by  the  ancients  as  a  Saint.  The reluctance  of  the  primitive  Roman  Church  to canonise  any  save  those  who  had  actually  shed their  blood  for  Christ  very  possibly  accounts for  the  omission  of  his  name  in  the  Roman Martyrology.

CHRYSANTHUS  and  DARIAS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  25) (3rd  cent.)  Chrysanthus,  an  Egyptian,  with his  wife,  Darias,  a  Greek,  were  distinguished  in Rome  for  their  zealous  profession  and  practice of  the  Christian  Religion.  This  led  to  their being  arrested  and  put  to  a  cruel  death,  under the  Emperors  Numerian  and  Carinus  (a.d.  283).  

CHRYSOGONUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  24)  
(4th  cent.)  A  zealous  Roman  priest,  the spiritual  guide  and  helper  of  St.  Anastasia  in her  work  of  comforting  the  Christian  prisoners awaiting  sentence  in  accordance  with  the persecuting  edicts  of  the  Emperor  Diocletian. The  Emperor  ordered  Chrysogonus  to  be brought  before  his  own  tribunal,  either  at Nicomedia,  or,  as  others  say,  at  Aquileia,  and sentenced  him  to  be  put  to  the  torture  and beheaded  (a.d.  304).  His  name,  inserted  with that  of  St.  Anastasia  in  the  Canon  of  the  Mass, is  a  convincing  proof  of  the  special  honour  in which  his  memory  was  held  in  the  early  Church.  

CHRYSOLIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Armenian  Christian  who devoted  himself  to  missionary  work  in  the north-east  of  Gaul,  where,  it  is  said,  he  was consecrated  Bishop.  He  had  left  Armenia  in safety,  notwithstanding  the  persecution  under Diocletian  then  raging,  but  won  the  crown  of Martyrdom  in  Flanders.  His  relics  are  venerated at  Bruges.

(11th  cent.)  The  virginwife  of  St.  Henry, Emperor  of  Germany,  whom  she  espoused  with the  pact  that  their  union  should  only  be  that of  brother  and  sister.  Her  life  from  childhood was  one  of  prayer,  penance  and  alms-deeds. Among  other  wonders  related  of  her  is  that  of her  having  passed  unscathed  through  the  ordeal of  walking  barefoot  over  a  red-hot  iron  ploughshare. Surviving  her  husband,  she  gave  all she  had  to  the  poor,  and  retired  into  a  Benedictine monastery  she  had  founded,  where  she died  (a.d.  1040).  Her  relics  are  enshrined  with those  of  St.  Henry  in  the  Cathedral  of  Bamberg.

♦CIAN  (St.)  (Dec.  11)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Saint,  a  soldier  who ended  his  life  as  a  hermit  in  Carnarvonshire. He  is  sometimes  described  as  the  servant  of St.  Peris,  which,  if  true,  would  aid  in  fixing  the century  in  which  that  Saint  flourished.  

♦CIANAN  (KENAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  24)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  fifty  hostages  given to  the  Irish  King  Leoghaire,  and  released  at the  instance  of  St.  Kyran.  After  passing  some time  in  the  monastery  of  St.  Martin  at  Tours, he  returned  to  Ireland  and  devoted  himself  to missionary  work.  He  is  said  to  have  been consecrated  a  Bishop.  He  died  Nov.  24, A.D.  489.

working  of  miracles. He  passed  away  Sept.  9, 
A.D.  548.

of  Rheims,  and  Apostle  of  the  Franks.  She died  at  Laon  some  time  after  a.d.  458,  in  fame of  great  holiness,  and  is  registered  as  a  Saint  in the  Western  Martyrologies.  

♦CILLENE  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  3)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who  migrated  to Iona,  and  was  there  elected  Abbot  (a.d.  726) on  account  of  his  singular  holiness.  

♦CINNIA  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  1)  
(5th  cent.)  A  princess  of  the  Kingdom  of Ulster,  who  becoming  a  Christian  received  the veil  from  St.  Patrick  and  was  placed  in  a monastery  under  the  care  of  the  Abbess  Cathuberis.  She  converted  many  of  her  Pagan fellow-countrymen  and  was  renowned  for miracles.  She  passed  away  towards  the  close of  the  fifth  century.  

CINDEUS  (St.)  M.  (July  11)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  in  Pamphylia  (Asia Minor),  who  confessed  Christ  in  the  persecution under  Diocletian  (a.d.  300  about).  After enduring  torture,  he  was  burned  at  the  stake, and  passed  away  with  words  of  prayer  and praise  on  his  lips.

CLARA  of  RIMINI  (St.)  Widow.  (Feb.  10)  
(14th  cent.)  A  noble  lady  of  Rimini,  distinguished by  the  holiness  of  her  life,  which  was one  of  great  penance.  In  her  widowhood  she retired  to  a  convent  she  had  founded,  where she  passed  thirty-seven  years  till  her  holy death  (a.d.  1326).  

CLARE  (CLARA)  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  12)  
(13th  cent.)  A  maiden  of  Assisi,  daughter of  a  knight,  who  was  the  first  woman  to  embrace the  life  of  utter  poverty  and  unremitting  austerity taught  by  St.  Francis,  the  founder  of the  Order  of  Friars  Minor.  Consecrated  to God  by  the  Seraphic  Patriarch,  she  governed for  forty-two  years,  in  the  Fear  of  God,  the first  convent  of  Franciscan  Sisters,  insisting  to the  end  on  the  full  observance  of  the  Rule. The  one  favour  she  ever  asked  of  the  Holy  See was  that  the  convent  might  always  remain without  worldly  goods  of  any  kind.  She survived  St.  Francis,  whose  faithful  Counsellor she  had  been,  dying  in  the  year  1253,  and  was canonised  two  years  afterwards.  St.  Clare is  represented  with  a  monstrance  in  her  hand in  memory  of  her  having  in  this  attitude miraculously  saved  her  convent  from  assault and  pillage.  

CLARE  of  MONTEFALCO  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  18)  
(14th  cent.)  Clare  of  the  Cross,  a  nun  of  the Order  of  the  Hermits  of  St.  Augustine,  consecrated herself  to  God  from  her  youth  in  a convent  of  her  native  city,  of  which  later  she was  chosen  Abbess.  Her  life  was  one  of  ecstatic prayer  and  rigorous  penance.  Filled  with  an ardent  longing  for  perfection,  she  had  for  her distinctive  devotion  that  to  the  Passion  of Christ.  To  a  Sister,  marvelling  at  her  patience, she  is  reported  to  have  said  :  "If  thou  seekest the  Cross  of  Christ,  take  my  heart ;  in  it  thou wilt  find  my  Suffering  Lord."  In  effect,  when she  had  departed  from  this  world  (Aug.  18, A.D.  1308),  a  Crucifix  was  found  depicted  on the  flesh  of  her  heart.  Her  name  was  inserted in  the  Roman  Martyrology  by  Clement  XII in  the  eighteenth  century.  

CLARENTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  26)  
(7th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  ^Etherius 
in  the  See  of  Vienne  (France),  described  in  the 
Martyrology  of  that  Church  as  a  Saint.  He 
died  about  a.d.  620.  

CLARUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  10)  
(Date  uncertain.) The  first  Bishop  of  Nantes, 
sent as missionary  into  Armorica  (Brittany)  

either  by  St.  Peter  the  Apostle  himself,  as  was 
the  old  belief,  or  certainly  not  later  than  by 
CLEMENT 

one  of  the  Popes  of  the  third  century.  Certain dedications  of  churches  in  Cornwall  and  in  Wales to  St.  Clair  almost  certainly  refer  to  this  Saint. CLARUS  (CLAIR)  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  4)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Traditionally  described  as an  Englishman  of  noble  birth,  born  at  Rochester, who  after  having  been  ordained  priest,  passed into  Normandy,  where  in  a  hermitage  not  far from  Rouen  he  lived  a  saintly  life  crowned  by a  martyr's  death,  he  having  been  assassinated at  the  instigation  of  a  high-born  lady  whose advances  he  had  repulsed.  It  is  impossible  to assign  to  him  any  date.  The  limits  given  by the  English  Menology,  A.D.  666-A.D.  894,  must suffice.  The  insertion  of  his  name  in  the Roman  Martyrology  is  due  to  Usuardus  (9th century).  St.  Clair  was  much  venerated  in the  Middle  Ages.  Towns  in  France  bear  his name,  which  gave  rise  to  such  English  patronymics as  Sinclair  and  the  like.  It  seems  that there  was  another  St.  Clarus  who  also  nourished in  Normandy  in  the  Middle  Ages,  and  may perhaps  be  the  Saint  registered  in  the  Roman Martyrology  ;  but  the  history  of  the  one  and the  other  is  now  so  confused  that  we  forbear to  note  him  separately. CLARUS  (St.)  (Nov.  8)  
(4th  cent.)  A  wealthy  citizen  of  Tours  in France,  who  renounced  his  prospects  in  the world  to  place  himself  under  the  guidance  of the  famous  Bishop  St.  Martin.  Admitted  by him  into  the  monastery  of  Marmoutier  and  raised to  the  priesthood,  he  built  himself  a  small  cell in  the  vicinity,  and  in  a  short  time  reached  a high  degree  of  Christian  and  Religious  perfection. He  passed  away  in  the  odour  of  sanctity about  A.D.  397.  St.  Paulinus  of  Nola,  to  whom he  seems  to  have  been  personally  known, composed  two  poetical  epitaphs  for  his  tomb. CLASSICUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  18)  

See  SS.  LUCIUS,  SYLVANUS, &c. CLATEUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  4)  
(1st  cent.)  The  first  (or  possibly  the  second) Bishop  of  Brescia  in  Lombardy.  He  won  the crown  of  martyrdom  under  Nero,  A.D.  64. Nothing  more  is  known  of  him,  nor  do  his Relics  appear  to  be  anywhere  in  public  veneration. CLAUDIA  (St.)  M.  (March  2)

(1st  cent.)  A  British  tradition  is  to  the effect  that  one  of  the  daughters  of  King  Caractacus,  taken  with  him  prisoner  to  Rome  in  the time  of  the  Emperor  Claudius,  became  a Christian,  and  took  the  name  Claudia  in  Baptism ;  further,  that  she  married  the  Senator Pudens,  and  is  the  Claudia  mentioned  with  him by  St.  Paul  (2  Tim.,  iv.  21) ;  that  she  was  the mother  of  St.  Praxedes  and  St.  Pudentiana ; and  that  she  died  at  an  advanced  age  in  the second  century.

(6th  cent.)  Born  at  Salins,  a.d.  484,  and  at the  age  of  twenty  made  a  Canon  of  Besancon. In  a.d.  516  he  was  chosen  to  fill  that  See, which  he  governed  with  zeal  and  success  for some  seven  years.  He  then  retired  to  the monastery  of  St.  Eugendus  (St.  Oyend),  or Condat,  in  the  Jura  Mountains,  and  there  he 

showed  himself  a  model  of  Evangelical  perfection. He  died  about  a.d.  582.  His  body  was discovered  in  the  year  1243  to  be  still  incorrupt. There  is  some  controversy  as  to  the  year  of  his birth,  but  there  is  no  doubt  that  he  survived  to an  extreme  old  age.

(July  9) (3rd  cent.) Five  Christians,  of  whom  Claudius  is styled  a Notary and Nicostratus an Assistant  Prefect, described  in  the very  untrustworthy Acts  of  St. Sebastian  as  having suffered  martyrdom  at  the  same  time  as  that Saint  (A.D.  288  about).  They  were  seized  while engaged in burying the  bodies  of Martyrs, put  to  the  torture,  and  finally  drowned.  But  it is  very  doubtfid  whether  they  are  not  identical with  the  five  Saints  of  the  same  names,  styled Statuaries,  and  honoured  on  Nov.  8  with  the Four  Crowned  Martyrs. CLAUDIUS,  JUSTUS,  JUCUNDINUS  and  OTHERS (SS.)  MM.  (July  21)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  group  of  eight  or  (as  others say)  of  twenty-three  Martyrs,  who  suffered with  St.  Julia  at  Troyes  in  Gaul,  under  Aurelian (a.d.  273).  Their  bodies  are  enshrined  in  the monastery  of  Jouarre,  near  Meaux.  Claudius, an  officer  in  the  Imperial  army,  is  said  to  have been  a  former  suitor  for  the  hand  of  St.  Julia. CLAUDIUS,  ASTERIUS,  NEON,  DONVINA  and THEONILLA  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  23)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  of  the  persecution  under Diocletian  (A.d.  285)  at  Mgea,  in  Cilicia. Claudius,  Asterius  and  Neon,  brothers,  were crucified  ;  Domvina  (Domnina)  was  scourged to  death  ;  Theonilla  in  fine,  an  aged  widow, expired  on  the  rack. CLAUDIUS,  LUPERCUS  and  VICTORIUS  (SS.) MM.  (Oct.  30)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  sons  of  the  Centurion,  St. Marcellus.  In  the  persecution  under  Diocletian at  Leon  in  Spain  (about  a.d.  298)  they  were  put to  death  as  Christians.  Some  writers  make them  to  have  been  not  only  brothers,  but twelve  in  number. CLAUDIUS,  NICOSTRATUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.) MM.  (Nov.  8)  

These  are  among  the  Holy  Crowned  Martyrs, which  see  ;  as  also  the  Martyrs  of  the  same  names commemorated  on  July  9. CLAUDIUS, HILARIA, JASON and MAURUS, WITH  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  Roman  Martyrs  under  the Emperor  Numerian,  A.d.  283.  Claudius,  a tribune  in  the  army,  was  cast  into  the  Tiber with  a  heavy  stone  round  his  neck.  Seventy Christian  soldiers  were  then  beheaded  with Jason  and  Maurus,  his  two  sons.  Hilaria  his wife,  apprehended  while  burying  the  bodies of  her  children,  shared  their  fate. CLAUDIUS,  CRISPINUS,  MAGINA,  JOHN  and STEPHEN  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  3)  
(Date  unknown.) African  Martyrs,  concerning whom  nothing  save  their  names  has come  down  to  us.

(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Ancyra  in  Galatia (Asia  Minor),  who  was  put  to  death  tinder Diocletian  and  Maximinian  (A.D.  303).  He  is described  in  his  Acts  as  having  suffered  persecution for  twenty-eight  years.  His  relics,  taken to  Constantinople  in  the  sixth  century,  were brought  to  Western  Europe  by  the  Crusaders.

CLEMENT 
CLEMENT  MARY  HOFBAUER  (St.)  (March  15) (19th  cent.)  Born  a.d.  1770  in  Moravia  and religiously  brought  up  by  his  pious  mother,  he in  his  early  manhood  embraced  the  religious life  in  the  Congregation  of  the  Most  Holy Redeemer,  and  was  the  instrument  chosen  by Almighty  God  for  propagating  that  Institute in  Poland  and  neighbouring  countries.  He spared  himself  in  nothing,  so  that  thereby  he could  be  of  service  to  those  in  spiritual  or temporal  need.  He  died  at  Vienna,  a.d.  1820. Pope  Pius  VII,  then  reigning,  styled  him "  An  Apostolic  man,  the  glory  of  the  clergy  of Vienna,  and  a  pillar  of  the  Church."

CLEMENT  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Nov.  23)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth,  converted to  Christianity  either  by  St.  Peter  or  by  St. Paul.  He  accompanied  the  latter,  who  styles him  "  his  fellow-labourer  "  (Phil.  iv.  3),  on  some of  his  missionary  journeys.  He  followed  (or perhaps  preceded)  St.  Cletus  in  St.  Peter's Chair,  and  governed  the  Church  for  about  ten years.  His  noble  Epistle  to  the  Corinthians  is one  of  the  most  precious  monuments  of  the Sub-Apostolic  Age.  He  passed  away  under Trajan  (a.d.  100),  and,  as  constant  tradition holds,  died  an  exile  and  Martyr  in  the  Crimea. The  graceful  story  of  his  having  been  cast  into the  Black  Sea  with  an  anchor  round  his  neck, and  of  the  shrine  built  for  him  beneath  the waves  by  Angels,  is  well  known.  His  relics are  now  in  Rome  in  the  famous  Basilica  dedicated in  his  honour,  and  which  gives  his  title 
TO i\ \i\^T(\\x\f\\ 
CLEMENTINUS,  THEODOTUS  and  PHILOMENUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  14)  
(Date unknown.) Martyrs of Heraclea in 
Thrace,  of  uncertain  date,  and  concerning  whom 
no  more  than  their  names  have  come  down  to 
us.  

CLEOMENES  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  23)  

See  SS.  THEODULUS,  SATURNINUS, &c. CLEONICUS,  EUTROPIUS  and  BASILISCUS  (SS.)  

MM.  (March  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  These  Saints  belong  to  a  group of  forty  or  fifty  Martyrs,  victims  of  the  persecution under  Diocletian.  They  were  put  to  death on  account  of  their  religion  in  the  Province  of Pontus  on  the  Black  Sea,  towards  the  close  of the  third  century.  The  greater  number  seem to  have  been  soldiers  in  the  Imperial  army  ; but  several  were  crucified,  the  punishment reserved  to  slaves. CLEOPHAS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  28)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  two  disciples  of  the Way  to  Emmaus  (Luke,  xxiv.),  who  is  said  to have  been  murdered  by  the  Jews  in  the  very same  house  where  he  gave  hospitality  to  Our Lord  on  that  first  Easter  Sunday  It  has  been maintained,  but  without  great  probability,  that this  Cleophas  is  one  and  the  same  with  Cleophas, the  father  of  the  Apostle,  St.  James  the  Less (Matt.  x.  3).  According  to  Hegesippus,  he would  thus  have  been  a  brother  of  St.  Joseph. CLERUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Syrian  deacon,  said  to  have been  seven  times  put  to  the  torture  before  being beheaded  as  a  Christian.  He  was  martyred at  Antioch  at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth century,  but  whether  under  Diocletian  or  under the  Emperor  Licinius,  his  successor,  is  uncertain. *CLETHER  (SCLEDOG,  CLYDOG,  CLEER)  (Oct.  23)  
(St.)  
(6th  cent.)  Latinised  Clitanus.  One  of  the Saints  descended  from  King  Brychan  of  Brecknock, or  at  least  of  his  clan.  He  is  said  to  have been  a  disciple  of  St.  Brynach  and  to  have died  about  a.d.  520.  Several  dedications  of churches  (for  instance,  St.  Cleer,  near  Liskeard), perpetuate  his  memory.  

Another Cledog or Clydog (Cleodius) is 
6G 

commemorated on Aug. 19. He is alleged 
to  have  died  a  Martyr  in  Herefordshire,  a.d.  

482.  

CLETUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (April  26)  
(1st  cent.) A  Roman  of  Patrician  birth  who 
succeeded  St.  Linus  in  St.  Peter's  Chair  (a.d.  76), 
and  died  a.d.  83,  under  Domitian.  To  him  is 
attributed  the  dividing  of  the  city  of  Rome 
into  parishes.  It  may  be  taken  as  proved  that 
St.  Cletus  is  not  (as  in  modern  times  has  been 
asserted)  one  and  the  same  with  St.  Anacletus.  

The  latter  succeeded  to,  the  former  preceded, 
St.  Clement  in  the  Pontificate.  

CLICERIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  20)  
(5th cent.) Probably a native of Milan.  

He  was  Bishop  of  that  See  for  a  few  years  in 
the  first  half  of  the  fifth  century,  and  died  about 
A.D.  438.  Beyond  the  fact  of  his  having  been 
venerated  as  a  Saint  from  his  own  age  to  the 
present  day,  nothing  is  known  of  him.  

CLINIUS  (St.)  (March  30)  
(Date unknown.) A Greek, a  Benedictine 
monk  of  Monte  Cassino,  who  was  made  Superior 
of  the  dependent  monastery  of  St.  Peter  near 
Pontecorvo, where his relics are venerated.  

In  what  century  he  flourished  is  uncertain.  

CLODOALDUS  (CLOUD)  (St.)  (Sept.  7)  
(6th cent.) The third son of Clodomir, 
King  of  Orleans,  and  grandson  of  Clovis  and  of 
St. Clotilde,  by  the  latter  of  whom  he  was 
brought  up.  Having  lived  for  some  time  as  a 
disciple  of  the  hermit  St. Severinus,  he  was 
ordained  priest  and  gathered  many  followers, 
who  took  up  their  abode  with  him  at  a  spot 
in the neighbourhood of Paris, which has 
retained  the  name  of  Saint  Cloud.  He  died 
A.D.  560  at  the  age  of  fortv.  

CLODULPHUS  (CLOU)  (St.)  Bp.  (June  8)  
(7th  cent.)  He  was  the  son  of  St.  Arnulph 
(minister  of  King  Clotaire  II,  and  later  Bishop 
of  Metz)  and  born  A.D.  605.  Brought  up  at 
Court,  he  had  a  brilliant  future  before  him,  but 
preferring  the  service  of  the  Church,  he  was 
elected  Bishop  of  Metz  (a.d.  656)  and  discharged 
with  wonderful  zeal  and  charity  his  pastoral 
duties.  He  was  distinguished  above  all  for  his 
care  of  the  poor.  He  died  a.d.  696,  at  the  age 
of  ninety-one  years,  and  was  buried  in  his  church 
at  Metz.  In  the  tenth  century  a  great  part  of 
his relics were translated to the Abbey of 
Lay,  near  Nancy.  

CLOTILDE  (St.)  Queen,  Widow.  (June  3)  
(6th  cent.) The  daughter  of  Chilperic,  King 
of Burgundy, and the wife of Clovis, first 
Christian  King  of  the  Franks,  thus  becoming 
the  ancestress  of  the  Merovingian  monarchs  of 
France.  She espoused Clovis whilst  he was 
still  a  Pagan,  and  was  the  means  of  leading 
him  to  the  knowledge  of  the  true  Faith,  which 
he  embraced  after  his  miraculous  victory  at 
Soissons  over  the  Alamanni  (A.D.  496).  After 
the  death  of  her  husband,  St.  Clotilde  retired 
to  Tours,  to  the  tomb  of  St.  Martin,  devoting 
herself  to  works  of  charity  and  piety  until  her 
holy  death,  A.D.  545.  She  was  buried  by  the 
side  of  Clovis  in  the  church  of  St.  Genevieve  at 
Paris.  Her  name  is  found  written  Crotildes, 
Croctild,  Clotichilda,  Hlotild, &c.

(8th  cent.)  Little  is  known  about  him.  He appears  to  have  been  a  monk  at  Kildare,  and to  have  flourished  at  latest  in  the  eighth  century. If  the  tradition  representing  him  as  the  author of  the  well-known  Life  of  St.  Brigid  be  trustworthy, we  are  indebted  to  him  for  much interesting  information  regarding  that  Saint and  her  times. COINTHA  (QUINTA)  (St.)  (Feb.  8)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Egyptian  lady  (some  say  a young  maiden),  seized  as  a  Christian  at  the  outset of  the  Decian  persecution  (a.d.  249),  fastened to  the  tail  of  a  horse  and  dragged  through  the streets  of  Alexandria  till  her  holy  soul  forsook her  mangled  body.

Her  time  was  wholly  taken  up  in  prayer  and in  her  ministrations  to  the  sick  and  poor.  After passing  some  years  among  the  Beguines,  she found  her  vocation  in  reviving  among  the  Poor Clares  the  primitive  and  austere  spirit  of St.  Francis.  Like  him,  her  chief  devotion  was to  Our  Lord's  Passion  and  her  supreme  attraction to  the  practice  of  holy  poverty.  Her reform  quickly  spread  through  the  West  of Europe,  and  is  still  flourishing.  St.  Colette, with  St.  Vincent  Ferrer,  had  a  share  in  putting an  end  to  the  great  Schism  of  the  West.  Among the  miracles  she  wrought  was  the  raising  of  a dead  man  to  life.  She  died  at  Ghent  a.d.  1447, and  was  formally  canonised  by  Pope  Pius  VII in  the  year  1807. *COLGAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  20)

♦COLMAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  23)  
(8th  cent.)  A  monk  in  the  celebrated  monastery of  Lismore,  in  the  government  of  which he  succeeded  St.  Hierlug  (Zailug),  a.d.  698. Under  St.  Colman's  rule  a  vast  number  of disciples  flocked  to  Lismore,  and  he  became  the spiritual  father  of  numerous  holv  men  and illustrious  prelates.  He  died  A.D.  702.
♦COLMAN  of  LINDISFARNE  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  18)  
(7th  cent.)  The  Third  Bishop  of  Lindisfame  (the  original  seat  of  the  Bishopric  of Durham).  Like  his  predecessors,  St.  Aidan and  St.  Finan,  St.  Colman  was  a  monk  of St.  Columba's  monastery  of  Iona.*He  was  a 

man  of  austere  and  zealous  life,  and  ever  held 
in  high  repute  of  sanctity.  His  reluctance  to 
yield  to  the  Roman  tradition  fixing  the  date  of 
Easter  led  to  the  famous Synod  of  Whitby, 
held  in  presence  of  King  Oswy.  He  afterwards 
resigned  his  See  and  returned  to  Iona,  whence  he 
proceeded  to  the  West  of  Ireland,  where  he

(St.)  Abbot.  (June  9)  
(6th  cent.)  Of  the  blood  of  Irish  chieftains, born  in  Donegal  (Dec.  7,  a.d.  521),  Columba was  destined  to  be  the  founder  of  a  hundred monasteries  and  the  Apostle  of  Caledonia. From  boyhood  devoted  to  the  study  of  Holy Scripture  and  day-by-day  advancing  in  sanctity of  life,  he  was  ordained  priest  at  the  age  of twenty-five.  After  founding  Derry,  Durrow and  other  religious  houses,  he  with  twelve disciples,  crossed  in  the  year  563  to  Scotland, and  landed  in  the  Island  of  I  or  Hy  (now  called Iona),  where  he  built  the  world-famed  monastery which  was  for  two  centuries  the  nursery  of Bishops  and  Saints.  For  thirty-four  years Columba  travelled  about  evangelising  the Highlands  of  Scotland.  At  last,  weighed  down by  age  and  infirmities,  he  died  kneeling  before the  Altar  (June  9,  597),  and  was  buried  at  Iona. But  in  the  ninth  century  his  relics  were  translated to  Down  in  Ulster,  and  laid  by  the  side of  those  of  St.  Patrick.  St.  Adamnan,  one  of his  successors  at  Iona,  has  left  us  an  important and  interesting  Life  of  St.  Columba. COLUMBA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  17)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Spanish  nun,  whose  monastery, near  Cordova,  having  been  destroyed  by  the Moorish  invaders,  took  refuge  with  her  sisters in  the  city.  But  afterwards,  burning  with  the desire  to  die  for  Christ,  she  of  her  own  accord presented  herself  before  the  Cadi  and  reproached him  publicly  with  his  adherence  to  the  False Prophet,  Mohammed.  She  paid  for  her  boldness with  her  life.  She  was  beheaded  (giving  a  gold piece  to  her  excutioner)  and  her  body  thrown into  the  Guadalquivir  (a.d.  853).  It  was rescued  and  honourably  interred  by  St.  Eulogius, himself  afterwards  crowned  with  martyrdom.
♦COLUMBA  (St.)  V.M.  (Nov.  13)  
(Date  uncertain.) The  Patron  Saint  of  two 
parishes  in  Cornwall.  She  is  said  to  have  been 
a  Christian  Virgin  put  to  death  by  a  heathen 
King  of  Cornwall.  

♦COLUMBA  (St.)  Abbot.  (Dec.  12)  
(6th  cent.)  A  native  of  Leinster  and  disciple of  St.  Finnian,  who  became  a  great  master  of the  spiritual  life  and  governed  the  monastery of  Tyrdaglas  in  Munster  till  his  holy  death, A.D.  548. COLUMBA  (St.)  V.M.  (Dec.  31)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  Virgin  put  to  death at  Sens  in  Burgundy  under  the  Emperor Aurelian  (a.d.  273).  Terrible  tortures,  as  in the  case  of  so  many  Martyrs,  were  inflicted  upon her  before  her  head  was  struck  off.  Her  relics, venerated  at  Sens,  were  scattered  by  the  Huguenots in  the  sixteenth  century. COLUMBANUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  21)  
(7th  cent.)  Born  in  Leinster  about  a.d. 545,  he  learned  the  monastic  life  under  St. Comgall  in  the  latter's  famous  monastery  of Benchor.  Thence,  with  several  companions, he  proceeded  to  Britain  and  Gaul.  His  first great  foundation  was  that  of  the  Abbey  of Luxeuil,  over  which  he  presided  for  twentyfive years,  writing  there  his  Rule  for  Monks,  of which  the  characteristic  is  its  extreme  severity. In  disfavour  with  Queen  Brunechilde,  he departed  from  her  dominions  and,  leaving  his disciple  St.  Gall  in  Switzerland,  where  he  had built  some  monasteries,  crossed  the  Alps  and settled  at  Bobbio  in  the  North  of  Italy  He died  there  a.d.  615.  He  was  a  man  of  great ability,  as  his  writings  show,  and  rendered many  services  to  the  Church,  but  his  mistaken zeal  for  the  Celtic  date  of  Easter  and  the  illadvised  letter  he  wrote  to  Pope  St.  Boniface  IV against  Pope  Vigilius,and  upholding  the  so-called "  Three  Chapters  "  rejected  by  the  Church, has  unfortunately  served  as  a  weapon  against her  in  the  hands  of  Protestants. COMBS  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  9)

(5th  cent,  probably.)  There  may  have  been more  Saints  than  one  of  this  name,  confusion between  whom  has  occasioned  the  contradictory particulars  we  have  in  the  scattered  traditions. One  S.  Cominus  is  Patron  of  Ardcavan.  By some  he  is  represented  as  brother  of  St.  Attracta (5th  cent.) ;  by  others  to  have  lived  hundreds of  years  later. CONCESSA  (St.)  M.  (April  8)

See  SS.  PAPIAS,  DIODORUS, &c.  

CONON  (St.)  M.  (March  6)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  poor  gardener,  a  Christian  from Nazareth  in  Galilee,  who,  in  Pamphylia  (Asia Minor)  or,  as  others  say,  in  the  Island  of  Cyprus, suffered  a  barbarous  martyrdom  (A.D.  250). Nails  were  driven  through  his  ankles,  and  he was  forced  to  run  before  a  chariot  till  he  fell dying  to  be  crushed  by  its  wheels.  

CONON  and  his  SON  (SS.)  MM.  (May  29)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Conon  suffered  at  Iconium  in Asia  Minor  under  the  Emperor  Aurelian  (A.D. 275).  He  with  his  little  son,  twelve  years  of age,  was  roasted  before  a  slow  fire  and  then racked  to  death.  

CONRAD  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  26)  
(10th  cent.)  Bishop  of  Constance  in  Switzerland, to  which  dignity  he  was  raised  A.D.  934 on  account  of  the  great  repute  for  ability  and holiness  of  life  in  which  he  was  held.  His zeal  and  charity  as  Bishop  made  him  grow  yet more  in  popular  esteem.  His  piety  led  him  to make  thrice  the  pilgrimage  to  the  Holy  Land. He  died  A.D.  976t  and  was  buried  in  the  Church of  St.  Maurice,  one  of  those  built  by  himself. Many  miracles  followed,  and  he  was  canonised by  Pope  Calistus  II  (A.D.  1120).  

♦CONRAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  14)  
(7th  cent.)  A  holy  Bishop  of  the Orkney 
Islands,  a  man  of  austere  life  and  a  zealous 
Pastor  of  souls,  formerly  in  great  veneration 
in  the  North  of  Scotland.  

CONSORTIA  (St.)  V.  (June  22)  
(6th  cent.)  A  noble  lady  of  exemplary  life, who  being  greatly  persecuted  by  suitors,  withdrew into  a  convent,  built  by  herself  and  largely endowed  by  King  Clotaire,  out  of  gratitude  for her  having  miraculously  healed  his  dying daughter.  She  died  about  A.D.  570.  Very  little trust  can  be  put  in  the  extant  accounts  of  this Saint,  and  it  is  not  unlikely  that  she  flourished at  an  earlier  date  than  that  given  above.  

CONSTANCE  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  19)  

See  SS.  FELIX  and  CONSTANCE.  

♦CONSTANT  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  18)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  of  Lagherne. He  died  A.D.  777  under  circumstances  which led  to  his  being  venerated  as  a  Martyr.  Many miracles  are  recorded  as  having  been  wrought by  him.  

♦CONSTANTLY  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  Constantine  the Great,  who,  healed  of  a  mortal  infirmity  at  the tomb  of  St.  Agnes,  built  there  a  church,  and  was herself  converted  to  Christianity.  She  is  said to  have  lived  thenceforth  at  the  same  place  with other  maidens,  and  after  her  death  to  have  been honoured  as  a  Saint.  

CONSTANTINE  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  29) (2nd  cent.)  St.  Constantine,  first  Bi3hop  of Perugia  in  Central  Italy,  together  with  numerous Christians  of  his  flock,  is  stated  to  have  been put  to  death  on  account  of  his  religion  under the  Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius,  about  A.D.  178. The  detailed  Acts  of  the  Saint,  accessible  at Perugia,  are  unfortunately  far  from  reliable.  

♦CONSTANTINE  (St.)  M.  (March  11)  
(6th  cent.)  The  English  Martyrology  describes him  as  a  Cornish  prince  who  resigned  his crown,  founded  a  monastery  at  Govan  on  the Clyde,  converted  the  district  of  Cantyre,  and at  length  gave  his  life  for  the  Faith,  about A.D.  576.  Whether  he  was  the  King  Constantine ferociously  inveighed  against  by  St. Gildas  as  at  some  period  of  his  life  the  most wicked  of  tyrants,  or  another  prince  of  the  same name,  must  be  left  an  open  question.  The approved  Scottish  Lections  speak  of  him  as having  been  before  his  conversion  "  immersed in  worldly  cares  and  defiled  by  vices." 
CONSTANTINE  (St.)  (March  11)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Saint  of  Carthage  in Africa,  whose  Acts  have  been  lost.  It  is  not even  known  in  what  century  he  flourished.

(9th  cent.)  Constantine  II,  King  of  Scotland, was  slain  in  a  battle  against  heathen invaders  of  his  country  (a.d.  874),  and  was thenceforth  locally  honoured  as  a  Martyr. He  was  buried  at  Iona.  

CONSTANTINE  (St.)  Bp.  (April  12)  
(6th  cent.)  All  we  know  of  him  is  that  he 
subscribed  the  Acts  of  the  celebrated  Council 
of  Epaon  (A.D.  517)  and  that,  he  had  then  only 
recently  been  made  a  Bishop.

The  community  of  monks  of  the monastery  of  St.  Dius  at  Constantinople,  in whose  choir  by  their  Rule  the  Psalmody  was continuous  by  night  as  by  day.  At  the  time of  the  Acacian  Schism  they  remained  faithful to  the  Holy  See,  and  in  consequence  many  of them  were  cast  into  prison  and  others  put  to death  (a.d.  485).

CONSTANTINOPLE  (MARTYRS  OF).  (July  8) (9th  cent.)  The  Martyrs  known  as  the Abrahamite  Monks,  from  the  name  of  the monastery  in  which  they  lived  their  Religious life.  They  withstood  the  Iconoclast  Emperor Theophilus  and  were  on  that  account  punished with  exile  and  death  (a.d.  832).  Unfortunately, authentic  details  of  their  sufferings  are  no longer  obtainable,  the  accounts  extant  being clearly  of  late  date  and  untrustworthy.

CONSTANTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  1)

He  flourished in  the  latter  part  of  the  sixth  century.  

CONSTANTIUS  (St.)  (Nov.  30)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Roman  priest  who  vigorously and  successfully  refuted  the  Pelagian  heretics, dangerous  in  his  time  on  account  of  their approach  to  rationalistic  teachings.  He  had to  endure  no  little  opposition  and  even  positive persecution  at  their  hands.  The  singular piety  of  his  life,  attested  by  miracles,  led  to his  being  registered  in  the  ancient  lists  as  a Saint.

He  fixed  his See  at  Freissingen,  where,  after  a  long  and fruitful  Episcopate,  he  died  a.d.  730.  A detailed  account  of  his  life  and  of  the  miracles which  illustrated  his  sanctity  has  come  down  to us  from  the  pen  of  Alibert,  his  third  successor at  Freissingen.

St.  Cornelius  upheld  the  Roman tradition  of  benignity  in  dealing  with  "  fallen Christians  "  ;  and  this  even  against  the  great authority  of  St.  Cyprian  of  Carthage,  part  of his  correspondence  with  whom  is  still  extant. He  overcame  the  Rigorist  Anti-Pope  Novatian, but  was  banished  by  the  Imperial  authorities to  Civita  Vecchia  (Centumcellce),  where  he eventually  suffered  martyrdom.

With  them  suffered  their  other  three brothers,  Anthimus,  Leontius  and  Euprepius. Their  relics  were  brought  to  Rome,  where  an important  church  was  dedicated  in  their  honour. Their  memory  has  always  been  in  great  veneration in  the  East  and  in  the  West.  Two  other pairs  of  brothers  of  the  same  name  have  place in  the  Menologies  of  the  Greeks.

Craton,  a  philosopher  and Professor  of  Rhetoric,  converted  to  Christianity by  St.  Valentine,  Bishop  of  Teramo,  suffered martyrdom  in  Rome  shortly  after  that  holy man  (a.d.  273).  His  wife  and  children,  with many  of  his  household,  were  executed  at  the same  time,  likewise  on  account  of  their  religion.

(3rd  cent.)  Zealous  Roman  Christians  who, for  preaching  the  Gospel,  were  scourged  and afterwards  burned  to  death  (a.d.  244  about). The  St.  Helladius,  Bishop  and  Martyr,  commemorated on  the  same  or  preceding  day, appears  to  be  other  than  the  St.  Helladius  here mentioned.

(1st  cent.)  The  disciple  of  St.  Paul  mentioned 
by  him  (2  Tim.  iv.  10)  as  having  gone  into 
CRISPUS 

Galatia.  He  is  stated  to  have  been  appointed Bishop  either  of  the  Galatians  or  of  Chalcedon. Tradition  goes  on  to  tell  us  of  his  Apostolate  of Dauphin6  in  Gaul,  and  again  of  his  having founded  the  See  of  Mentz  in  Germany.  However, he  appears  to  have  returned  in  the  end  to the  East.  The  Roman  Martyrology  adds  that he  suffered  martyrdom  under  Trajan  (a.d.  100 about).  The  Feast  of  the  Translation  of  his relics  would  appear  to  have  been  kept  on Dec.  29. CRESCENS  (St.;  Bp.  (Nov.  28)

(2nd  cent.)  A  Christian  who  suffered  death for  Christ  at  Sassari  in  the  Island  of  Sardinia at  the  same  time  as  SS.  Gabinus  and  Crispulus, in  the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Hadrian  (A.D.  130 about).  He  is  still  in  great  veneration  there. CRESCENTIANUS  (CRESCENTINUS)  (June  1) (St.)  M.

A  Roman  soldier,  a  veteran, who  retired  to  lead  a  hermit's  life  in  a  solitary place  near  Citta  di  Castello  (Tiphernum)  in  the Apennine  Mountains,  but  who,  delated  as  a Christian,  was  put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded (a.d.  287).  He  is  often  represented  by  artists as  clad  in  a  deacon's  dalmatic,  though  in  all probability  he  remained  all  his  life  a  layman. CRESCENTIANUS  (St.)  M.  (Julv  2)

(3rd  cent.)  Shoemakers  by  trade,  victims  of the  great  persecution  under  Diocletian.  They were  beheaded  because  of  their  religion  at Soissons  in  France,  a.d.  287.  They  were  in great  popular  veneration  throughout  the Middle  Ages  (see  in  this  connection  Shakspeare's Henry  V,  Act.  IV,  Scene  II) ;  but  the  adoption of  the  Roman  Calendar  in  which  Oct.  25 (their  day),  is  occupied  by  the  Feast  of  the Martyrs  SS.  Chrysanthus  and  Darias,  has  caused the  liturgical  keeping  of  their  festival  to  fall  into desuetude.  They  are  the  recognised  Patron Saints  of  shoemakers,  and  are  often  represented with  the  tools  of  their  trade  or  with  strips  of leather  in  their  hands.  Some  of  their  relics are  in  Rome,  and  a  noble  church  was  erected at  Soissons  in  their  honour. CRISPIN  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Nov.  19)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Ecija  (Astiage)  in Andalusia  (Spain),  beheaded  as  a  Christian under  the  persecuting  Emperor  Maximian Herculeus  at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth century.

(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  famous  of  the African  Martyrs  of  the  Early  Church.  We  have still  her  Panegyric  preached  by  the  great St.  Augustine.  She  was  a  wealthy  matron  of high  birth,  who,  preferring  her  Faith  to  all worldly  goods,  cheerfully  laid  down  her  life  for Christ.  Having  been  put  to  the  torture  and forced  to  undergo  the  most  shameful  indignities, she  was  beheaded  at  Thebeste  in  Numidia  (a.d. 304). CRISPIN  of  PAVIA  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  7)  
(5th  cent.)  More  than  one  holy  Prelate  of this  name  in  ancient  times  illustrated  the  See of  Pavia  in  Lombardy.  One  of  them  in  the first  half  of  the  third  century  governed  it  for thirty-five  years,  ever  solicitous  not  only  for the  spiritual  advancement  of  his  flock,  but  also for  the  temporal  well-being  of  the  city.  It  was probably  in  his  honour  that  the  Feast  of  Jan.  7 was  first  instituted,  though  the  entry  in  the Roman  Martyrology  is  commonly  understood to  commemorate  another  Bishop  St.  Crispin who  subscribed  (a.d.  451)  the  Acts  of  the Council  of  Milan  in  support  of  Pope  St.  Leo the  Great,  and  who  was  the  immediate  predecessor of  St.  Epiphanius.

MM.  

(First  cent.)  Martyrs  believed  to  have  suffered under  Nero  in  the  Apostolic  Age,  and probably  in  Rome.  Baronius,  however,  following Rabanus  Maurus,  assigns  them  to  Spain. No  account  of  them  is  extant. CRISPUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  18)  

See  SS.  JOHN  and  CRISPUS. CRISPUS  and  CAIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  4)  
(1st  cent.)  Saints  of  the  Apostolic  Age,  the two  whom  alone  St.  Paul  baptised  at  Corinth (1  Cor.  i.  13).  Crispus  was  ruler  of  the  synagogue in  that  city  (Acts  xviii.  8).  Caius  in  all likelihood  is  the  same  as  the  person  whom  the Apostle  styles  "  my  host "  (Rom.  xvi.  23), and  also  (which  is  the  opinion  of  Origen  and  of Venerable  Bede)  the  "  dearly  beloved  Gains (Caius) " to whom St. John addressed his

♦CRONAN  THE  WISE  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  9)  
(8th  cent.)  The  striking  characteristic  of this  St.  Cronan  was  his  zeal,  ability  and  success in  the  regulating  of  Ecclesiastical  discipline. He  drew  up  many  sets  of  disciplinary  laws, from  which  he  came  to  be  styled  "  Cronan  of the  Nones."  He  was  probably  a  Bishop  of Lismore,  and  identical  with  the  holy  Prelate known  there  as  St.  Roman.  He  must  have flourished  early  in  the  eighth  century. *CRONAN  BEG  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  7)  
(7th  cent.) A  Bishop  of  ancient  iEndrum (Down), mentioned in connection with the Paschal  Controversy  in  A.D.  640.

♦CUARAN  (CURVINUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  9)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  sur named  like some  others,  "  The  Wise,"  who  concealed  his Episcopal  dignity  in  order  to  embrace  the Religious  Life  as  a  simple  monk  at  Iona,  where, however,  he  was  eventually  recognised  by  St. Columba.  He  died  probably  some  years  after A.D.  700. *CUBY  (CYBY)  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  8)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Cornish  Saint,  a  cousin  of St.  David  of  Wales.  Consecrated  Bishop, he  with  ten  disciples  settled  near  Tregony, but  later  passed  some  time  in  Ireland.

The  exact  date  of  his  death  is not  known. CUCUPHAT  (St.)  M.  (July  25)  
(4th  cent.)  An  African  Christian  who, having  crossed  into  Spain,  was  put  to  death  on account  of  his  religion  near  Barcelona,  in  the time  of  Diocletian  at  the  close  of  the  third  or beginning  of  the  fourth  century.  The  Christian poet  Prudentius  mentions  St.  Cucuphat  in  his Hymns,and  he  is  in  great  veneration  in  Catalonia. Part  of  his  relics  have  been  translated  to  Paris. His  name  is  variously  written  Cucuphas,  Cougat, Quiquefat,  Gulnefort,  &c. CULMATIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  19)  

See  SS.  GAUDENTIUS  and  CULMATIUS. *CUMGAR  (CUNGAR,  CYNGAR)  (St.)  (Nov.  2)

(6th  cent.)  A  son  of  Geraint,  Prince  of Devon,  and  founder  of  monasteries  at  Badgworth,  Congresbury  (Somerset)  and  at  Llangenys  (Glamorgan).  He  lived  in  the  sixth century, and  is  one  and  the  same with St.  

72 

Docuinus  or  Doguinus.  This  seems  to  be  the name  which  was  later  corrupted  into  Oue  and Kew.  St.  Cumgar  was  buried  at  Congresbury, to  which  town  he  has  given  his  name.  The compilers  of  the  English  Menology  hold  that St.  Cumgar  flourished  in  the  eighth  century in  the  time  of  King  Ina  of  Wessex.  

♦CUMINE  THE  WHITE  (St.)  Abbot.  (Oct.  6)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Abbot  of  Iona,  of  Irish descent,  who  wrote  a  Life  of  St.  Columba. He  died  A.D.  669.  

♦CUMMIAN  FADA  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  12)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Columbian  monk,  Abbot  of the  monastery  of  Kilcummin  (King's  County). In  the  disputes  about  the  date  of  Easter  he was  a  strenuous  upholder  of  the  Roman  system of  calculation.  He  died  A.D.  662.  Some  think that  he  is  identical  with  St.  Cummian,  Bishop of  Clonfert.  

♦CUMMIANUS  (CUMIAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  19)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Bishop  who  resigned  his See  in  order  to  retire  to  the  monastery  founded by  St.  Columbanus  at  Bobbio  in  the  North  of Italy,  where  he  lived  and  died  in  great  fame  of sanctity.  He  was  an  energetic  advocate  of  the Roman  date  of  Easter.  He  died,  according  to some,  A.D.  661 ;  to  others,  A.D.  682.

CUNIBERT  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  12)  
(7th  cent.)  A  nobly-born  Frank  brought  up at  the  Court  of  King  Dagobert  I,  who,  from being  Archdeacon  of  Treves,  was  (a.d.  633) elected  Archbishop  of  Cologne.  Not  only  did his  virtues  render  him  the  idol  of  his  flock,  but his  statesmanlike  ability  and  prudence  led  to his  enjoying  the  favour  and  confidence  of  King Dagobert  and  of  the  two  monarchs  who  succeeded him,  all  of  whom  he  served  as  chief minister.  He  died  A.D.  664.  A  stately  church at  Cologne  is  dedicated  in  his  honour.  

♦CUNO  (CONRAD)  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  1)  
(11th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Treves  in the  time  of  the  Emperor  Henry  IV.  He  met  his death  while  defending  the  rights  of  his  Church (A.D.  1066)  and  was  at  once  acclaimed  as  a Martyr  by  his  devoted  people.  

CURCODOMUS  (St.)  (May  4)

There  is, however,  great  difficulty  in  tracing  his  history and  even  in  distinguishing  him  from  other Saints  bearing  names  resembling  his.

CUTHBERT  (St.)  Bp.  (March  20)  
(7th  cent.) Born  at  Melrose  on  the  river 
Tweed,  St.  Cuthbert  in  his  youth  tended  his 
father's  sheep  until,  having  in  a  vision  at  the 
CYRIACA 

moment  of  the  death  of  St.  Aidan  seen  that Saint  mounting  in  glory  to  Heaven,  he  embraced the  monastic  life.  As  guestmaster  of  Melrose Abbey,  while  courteous  and  affable  to  all,  he was  specially  solicitous  for  poor  wayfarers,  and on  one  occasion  entertained  an  Angel  in  the guise  of  a  beggar.  He  governed  for  some  time the  Monastery  of  Lindisfarne  or  Holy  Island, off  the  coast  of  Northumberland,  which  he reluctantly  quitted  to  become  Bishop  of  that See,  later  transferred  to  Durham.  Though always  a  lover  of  prayer  and  solitude,  he distinguished  himself  by  his  beneficent  influence on  public  affairs,  and  enjoyed  the  confidence of  the  princes  of  his  time.  The  miracles  he wrought  earned  him  the  title  of  the  Thaumaturgus  (Wonder-worker)  of  Britain.  Towards the  close  of  the  second  year  of  his  Episcopate he  retired  to  the  little  Isle  of  Fame (nine  miles  from  Lindisfarne),  and  there  passed away  March  20,  a.d.  687.  His  shrine  at Durham  was  one  of  the  most  frequented  in Catholic  England,  and  more  than  four  centuries after  his  death  his  body  was  found  to  be  still incorrupt.  It  was  hidden  at  the  time  of  the so-called  Reformation,  and  is  believed  to  be  yet resting in some obscure recess of Durham

Born  in  Devonshire,  he  had  been  educated  as a  Protestant,  but  was  converted  to  the  True Faith  while  studying  at  Oxford.  He  was ordained  priest  at  Douai,  and  then  began  to labour  as  a  missionary  priest  in  Cornwall ;  but before  a  year  had  elapsed,  was  arrested,  tried and  condemned  to  death,  for  the  crime  of  having said  Mass.  He  suffered  near  Launceston, A.D.  1577.

(8th  cent.)  A  sister  of  King  Ina  of  Wessex, betrothed  to  Oswy  of  Northumbria,  but  with  his consent  released  from  her  obligation  and  admitted to  the  Religious  Life.  She  was  trained thereto  by  St.  Hildelid  at  Barking  Abbey.  She afterwards  founded  the  great  Abbey  of  Wimborne  in  Dorsetshire,  where  her  sister  St. Quenburga  was  associated  with  her.  Wimborne was  the  school  in  which  SS.  Lioba,  Thecla  and other  great  and  saintly  women  prepared  for  their lives  of  Christian  devotedness  and  usefulness. St.  Cuthburga  passed  away  a.d.  724  or  thereabouts, and  her  festival  is  marked  in  several Liturgical  Calendars.
♦CUTHMAN  (St.)  (Feb.  8)  
(8th  cent.) A  South  of  England  Saint  who lived  a  holy  life  as  a  shepherd  near  Steyning  in Sussex,  of  which  place  the  old  church  is  dedicated in  his  honour. CUTIAS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  18)

See  SS.  CODRATUS,  DIONYSIUS, &c. CYPRIAN  (St.)  M.  (July  11)  

See  SS.  SAVINUS  and  CYPRIAN. CYPRIAN  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  Thascius  Csecilius  Cyprian,  a cultured  and  wealthy  Carthaginian,  after  teaching with  distinction  Philosophy  and  Rhetoric, was  converted  to  Christianity  (it  is  believed comparatively  late  in  life).  He  was  soon raised  to  the  priesthood  and  a  year  after  was consecrated  Bishop  of  Carthage  (a.d.  248). Cheerful  and  courteous  to  every  one,  his  charity and  piety  speedily  won  all  hearts.  But  it  was by  his  writings,  of  which  even  the  literary  merit is  very  great,  that  he  has  chiefly  served  the Church.  He  was  linked  in  bonds  of  cordial sympathy  and  friendship  with  the  Martyr-Pope, St.  Cornelius,  and  in  his  own  books  bears  explicit and  striking  witness  to  the  necessary  Oneness of  the  Church  founded  on  the  Rock  of  Peter. His  conviction  appears  the  more  from  his  boldness and  insistency  in  maintaining  his  own erroneous  views  on  the  validity  of  Baptism conferred  by  heretics,  to  which  he  sought  in vain  to  draw  Pope  St.  Stephen.  His  treatise on  Lapsed  or  Fallen  Christians  is  a  noble  summary of  the  merciful  doctrine  of  Rome  in  regard to  sinners.  St.  Cyprian  by  a  prudent  retreat escaped  the  persecution  of  Christians  under Decius  (a.d.  250).  He  won  his  crown  under Valerian  (a.d.  258),  when  he  was  beheaded  in presence  of  his  sorrowing  flock.  For  a  vivid description  of  the  Martyrdom  of  St.  Cyprian, see  his  Life  by  his  disciple  Pontius.  With  him in  his  triumph  were  associated  SS.  Crescentianus, Victor,  Generalis,  Rosula,  and  other  Christians of  Carthage. CYPRIAN  and  JUSTINA  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  26)  
(4th  cent.)  Cyprian,  from  leading  a  life  of sin  and  making  his  livelihood  as  a  necromancer and  astrologer,  was  converted  to  Christianity by  the  virgin  St.  Justina,  whom  he  had  thought to  lead  astray.  In  the  persecution  under Diocletian  they  were  both  arrested  and  taken to  the  Imperial  residence  at  Nicomedia  (Asia Minor)  and  there  condemned  and  beheaded on  account  of  their  religion  (a.d.  300  about). Their  relics  are  now  enshrined  in  Rome  in  the Baptistery  of  the  Church  of  St.  John  Lateran. CYPRIAN  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  12)  

See  SS.  FELIX  and  CYPRIAN. CYPRIAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Dec.  9)  
(6th  cent.)  A  monk  of  P6rigueux  (France) who  ended  a  holy  life  as  a  hermit  on  the  banks of  the  Dordogne  (a.d.  586).  St.  Gregory  of Tours  speaks  of  the  many  miracles  wrought  by him  both  in  life  and  after  death. CYR  (St.)  M.  (June  16)

(4th  cent.)  Six Christian maidens  who 
perished  at  the  stake,  at  Nicomedia,  the  Imperial 
residence,  under  Maximinian  Galerius  (a.d.  307).  

CYRIACA  (DOMINICA)  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  21)  
(3rd  cent.) A  wealthy  Roman  widow  who 
sheltered  the  persecuted  Christians  and  to  whose 
house  St.  Laurence,  the  deacon  and  Martyr,  was 
accustomed  to  repair  to distribute  his alms.  

Her  courageous  charity  cost  her  her  life.  She 
was  scourged  to  death  as  a  Christian  (a.d.  249).

See  SS.  PAULUS,  LUCIUS, &c. CYRIACUS,  LARGUS,  SMARAGDUS  and  OTHERS (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  8)  
(4th  cent.)  A  group  of  more  than  twenty Christians,  among  the  victims  in  Rome  of  the great  persecution  under  the  Emperors  Diocletian and  Maximian  Herculeus  (a.d.  303). They  were  beheaded  after  having  been  put  to the  torture.  St.  Cyriacus,  who  was  a  deacon, gave  his  name  to  a  famous  church,  seat  or  title of  a  Cardinal  deacon.  On  its  falling  in  the fifteenth  century  into  ruin,  its  privileges,  with the  relics  enshrined  in  it,  were  transferred  to  the church  called  Santa  Maria  in  Via  Lata. CYRIACUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  7)  
(Date unknown.)  Eleven Christians registered in  the  Martyrologies  as  having  suffered at  Nicomedia  in  Asia  Minor.  But  the  date  and all  particulars  have  been  long  since  lost. CYRIACUS  (St.)  M.  (May  2)

(4th cent.) Most probably a Bishop of 
Ancona  (Italy)  who,  while  making  his  pilgrimage 
to  the  Holy  Land,  perished  in  the  persecution 
of  Julian  the  Apostate  (a.d.  362/.  But  many 
assert  that  he  was  a  Bishop  of  Jerusalem,  put 
to death under Hadrian (A.D. 117-138).  In 
reality  nothing  certain  is  now  known  about  him.  

His  relics  are  venerated  at  Ancona.  

CYRIACUS  and  PAULA  (SS.)  MM.  (June  18)  
(4th  cent.)  Two  Christians,  stoned  to  death 
at  Malaga  in  Spain  during  the  persecution  under 
Diocletian (a.d. 305 about). St. Paula is 
registered  as  a  Virgin  Martyr,  but  no  details  are

(Dec.  19) (4th  cent.)  Some  of  the  numberless  Christians who  suffered  at  Nicomedia,  the  residence of the Emperor Diocletian (a.d. 303).  No particulars  are  extant. CYRIL  and  METHODIUS  (SS.)  Bps.  (March  9) (9th  cent.) Two  brothers,  the  Apostles  of the  Sclavonians  or  Slavs,  born  in  Greece  and educated  at  Constantinople. They  were  sent by  the  Patriarch  St.  Ignatius  as  missionaries to  the  Bulgarians,  which  people,  following  the example of their king, speedily embraced Christianity  (a.d.  861-865).  Cyril  had  previously preached in Southern Russia. They pursued  their  work  in  Moravia  and  Dalmatia. 74 

On  their  coming  to  Rome  to  render  an  account of  their  mission,  Pope  Hadrian  II  consecrated them  Bishops.  Cyril,  however,  died  there, leaving  Methodius  to  continue  alone  their Apostolate,  which  he  did  with  marvellous  success in  Moravia,  Bohemia,  Poland  and  the  neighbouring countries.  To  him  is  attributed  the Slav  alphabet,  into  which  tongue  he  translated the  Holy  Scriptures.  He  died  in  Moravia  at  an advanced  age  at  the  close  of  the  ninth  century. The  relics  of  the  two  brothers  are  venerated in  the  church  of  San  Clemente  in  Rome,  and Pope  Leo  XIII  ordered  their  festival  to  be solemnly  kept  throughout  the  Christian  world on  July  7.  

CYRIL  of  JERUSALEM  (St.)  Bp.,  (March  18)  

Doctor  of  the  Church.  

(4th  cent.)  Born  near  Jerusalem  a.d.  315. He  was  ordained  priest  a.d.  345,  and  became Patriarch  in  350.  Driven  by  the  Arians  from his  See  he  returned  to  Jerusalem  under  Julian, and  was  an  eye-witness  of  the  futile  attempt of  the  Apostate  Emperor  to  rebuild  the  Temple. After  enduring  a  second  banishment  lasting eleven  years,  he  passed  away  in  peace  at  Jerusalem (A.D.  386).  His  Catecheses  or  simple expositions  of  Catholic  doctrine  are  most valuable.  Especially  luminous  is  his  clear teaching  of  the  Faith  on  the  subject  of  the Holy  Eucharist.  He  was  numbered  by  Pope Leo  XIII  among  the  Doctors  of  the  Church.  

CYRIL  (St.)  M.  (March  20)  

See  SS.  PAUL,  CYRIL, &c.  

CYRIL  (St.)  M.  (March  29)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Palestinian  deacon,  martyred under  Julian  the  Apostate  (A.D.  362).  According to  Theodoret,  his  body  was  frightfully mutilated  before  the  executioner  put  an  end  to his  sufferings.  

CYRIL  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (July  9)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  aged  prelate,  Bishop  of Gortyna  in  the  Island  of  Crete,  tortured  and beheaded  in  the  Decian  persecution  (a.d.  250).  

CYRIL  of  ALEXANDRIA  (St.)  Bp.,  (Jan.  28)  

Doctor  of  the  Church.  

(5th  cent.)  By  birth  an  Egyptian,  and  nephew of  St.  Theophilus,  whom  he  succeeded (A.D.  412)  in  the  Patriarchate  of  Alexandria. From  the  outset  he  showed  himself  a  zealous champion  of  the  Catholic  Faith.  He  was unsparing  in  his  efforts  to  eradicate  the  last vestiges  of  Paganism,  but  that  he  was  an  abettor of  the  murder  of  Hypatia,  the  girl-philosopher, is,  in  the  words  of  a  Protestant  writer,  "  an unsupported  calumny."  He  wrote  Commentaries on  the  Holy  Scriptures  and  other notable  works,  but  his  chief  glory  is  his  successful overthrowing  of  the  subtle  heresy  of  Nestorius (who  taught  that  Christ  was  not  truly  God, but  a  mere  man,  the  instrument  of  the  Godhead, that  is,  that  in  Him  there  axe  two  Persons), condemned  in  the  great  Council  of  Ephesus (A.D.  431),  which  was  presided  over  by  St.  Cyril as  Legate  of  Pope  St.  Celestine.  In  this Council  Our  Lady's  title  of  Theotokos  (Mother of  God)  was  formally  recognised.  Intrigues at  Constantinople  led  to  St.  Cyril's  imprisonment, but  liberated,  in  consequence  of  the  strong action  of  the  Pope,  he  returned  to  Alexandria, and  there  passed  away  in  peace,  Jan.  28,  444. Leo  XIII  proclaimed  him  a  Doctor  of  the  Church and  assigned  Feb.  9  as  his  Festival  Day.

CYRILLA  (St.)  M.  (July  5)  
(4th  cent.)  An  aged  Christian  widow  of Cyrene  (Africa)  who,  with  others,  was  put  to death  in  that  place,  for  refusing  to  sacrifice  to idols.  She  appears  to  have  expired  in  the torture  chamber,  and  so  not  to  have  been beheaded,  as  was  usual  in  the  official  persecutions of  the  early  centuries  (a.d.  300  about).  

CYRILLA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  28)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  daughter  of  St.  Tryphonia and  a  sharer  in  the  good  works  of  that  holy Roman  widow.  She  was  put  to  death  as  a Christian  under  the  Emperor  Claudius  II (A.D.  268-270).  

CYRINUS,  PRIMUS  and  THEOGENES  (Jan.  3) (SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Cyzicus  on  the Hellespont,  under  the  Emperor  Licinius  (a.d. 320).  They  were  soldiers  in  the  Imperial  army and  preferred  to  die  rather  than  to  share  in  the idolatrous  sacrifices  at  which  the  troops  were compelled  to  assist.  St.  Theogenes  in  particular has  from  early  times  been  in  great  veneration both  in  the  East  and  in  the  West.  

CYRINUS  (St.)  M.  (April  26)

(Date  uncertain.)  Bede  and  all  the  Martyrologies commemorate  these  Saints  as  having suffered  at  Alexandria  in  Egypt.  St.  Cyrio was  a  priest,  St.  Bassian  a  Lector,  St.  Agatho an  Exorcist,  and  St.  Moses  a  layman.  It  would appear  that  on  Feb.  14  the  Church  of  Alexandria celebrated,  besides,  the  Martyrdom  of  a  great number  of  Christians,  probably  done  to  death in  a  single  massacre,  distinguishing  them  into various  groups  according  to  the  nature  of  the sufferings  they  endured.  St.  Cyrio  and  his companions  as  above  perished  at  the  stake. St.  Bassus  {which  see)  with  many  others  were drowned,  SS.  Dionysius  and  Ammonius  {which see)  were  beheaded.

CYRUS  and  JOHN  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  31)  
(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  of  the  last  stages  of  the great  persecution  under  Diocletian  and  his colleagues  (a.d.  312).  Cyrus,  an  Egyptian physician,  and  John,  a  Syrian,  were  devoting themselves  to  good  works  (some  say  in  the monastic  state  of  life)  when  they  were  seized, condemned  as  Christians,  and  beheaded  at Alexandria.  Their  remains  were  subsequently translated  to  Rome.  Metaphrastes  has  a  prolix description  of  their  trial  and  Passion.  

CYRUS  of  CARTHAGE  (St.)  Bp.  (July  14)  
(Date  unknown.)  Who  this  Saint  may  have been  is  quite  uncertain.  St.  Possidius  in  his Life  of  St.  Augustine  speaks  of  the  holy  Doctor's Sermon  on  the  Feast  of  St.  Cyrus,  Bishop  of Carthage  ;  but  it  is  not  unlikely  that  the  name may  be  a  mistake  for  that  of  St.  Cyprian.

One  of  the  SCILLITAN  MARTYRS,  which  see.

♦DABIUS  (DAVIUS)  (St.)  (July  22)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Butler  describes  him  as  an Irish  priest  who  worked  in  Scotland,  where  his name  appears  as  title  of  churches.  He  may  be identical  with  St.  Movean  or  Biteus,  disciple  of St.  Patrick.  According  to  Smith  and  Wace, more  to  him  than  to  St.  David  of  Wales  are  the Celtic  dedications  under  that  name  to  be  assigned. DACIANUS  (St.)  M.  (June  4)

St.  Dadas,  a  noble  Persian, Casdoe,  his  wife,  and  Gabdelas,  probably  their son,  together  with  Sapor,  a  near  relative  of  the King,  were  of  the  number  of  the  many  Christians who  suffered  martyrdom  under  Sapor  II (A.D.  310-363).  They  underwent  terrible  tortures before  finally  being  put  to  the  sword. DADAS  (St.)  M.  (April  13)  

See  SS.  MAXIMUS,  QUINCTILLIANUS,  &c. DAFROSA  (AFFROSA)  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  4)  
(4th  cent.)  The  wife  of  Fabian  (Flavian) also  a  Martyr,  and  the  mother  of  SS.  Bibiana and  Demetria,  VV.MM.  After  the  death  of her  husband  some  writers  say  that  she  herself was  decapitated  (a.d.  363).  Others  with  better reason  that  she  was  exiled  and  succeeded  in converting  to  Christianity  and  animating  to martyrdom  a  certain  Faustus  who  pretended to  her  hand,  and  who  may  be  the  Saint  of  that name  venerated  with  others  on  June  24.  But it  is  admitted  that  the  Acts  of  St.  Bibiana  are untrustworthy,  and  that  she  and  the  other Saints  referred  to  therein  may  have  flourished a  century  earlier  than  the  date  given.  The name  Dafrosa  is  often  written,  and  more correctly  Daphrosa. *DAGAN  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  27)  

Otherwise  St.  DECUMAN,  which  see. *DAG^EUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  18)  
(6th  cent.) An  Irish  Bishop  at  Iniskin  near Dundalk.  He  ministered  at  the  deathbed  of St.  Mochteus.  He  died  about  a.d.  560.
♦DALLAN  FORGAILL  (CLUAIN  DALLAIN)  
(St.)  M.  (Jan.  29)  
(6th  cent.)  A  kinsman  of  St.  Edan  of  Ferns, born  in  Connaught  and  a  great  scholar  who, through  his  application  to  study,  became  blind. He  wrote  a  poem  in  honour  of  St.  Columba, called  Ambra  Chohiim  Kille  which  was  only published  after  St.  Columba's  death.  The legend  averring  that  on  its  publication  Dalian's sight  was  restored  to  him  is  found  in  several authors.  St.  Dalian  was  murdered  at  Trisccel by  pirates  (a.d.  598),  and  his  head  thrown  into the  sea.  It  was  recovered  and  miraculously reunited  to  his  body. DALMATIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.

(4th  cent.)  A  former  Missionary  in  Gaul  who was  for  one  year  Bishop  of  Pavia  in  Lombardy, where  he  laid  down  his  life  for  the  Faith  during the  persecution  under  Maximian  Herculeus (A.D.  304). DAMASUS  (St.)  Pope.  (Dec.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  "  An  incomparable  man "  (so St.  Jerome  styles  him),  "  the  Virgin  Doctor  of the  Virgin  Church."  Of  Spanish  extraction, but  born  in  Rome,  he  attended  Pope  Liberius in  exile,  and  was  in  constant  communion  with St.  Athanasius.  He  succeeded  Liberius  (a.d. 366),  but  had  to  struggle  against  an  Anti-Pope, Ursinus,  whose  rebellion  was  finally  crushed, not  without  bloodshed,  by  the  Emperor  Valentinian.  St.  Damasus  held  Councils  in  Rome against  the  Arians  and  Apollinarians.  A cultured  man  (as  is  seen  from  Ids  verses)  he  was the  great  patron  of  St.  Jerome,  who  under  his direction re-translated into Latin or revised

DAMIAN 
the  current  versions  of  Holy  Scripture.  St. Damasus  is  famous  for  having  restored  and beautified  in  Rome  the  tombs  of  the  holy Martyrs.  His  share  in  the  development  of  tJae Roman  Liturgy,  mainly  by  the  introduction of  certain  elements  borrowed  from  the  Eastern Rites,  was  considerable.  He  died  nearly  eighty years  old,  A.D.  364,  and  was  buried  in  one  of the  two  important  churches  he  had  built  in honour  of  St.  Laurence  the  Martyr.  

DAMIAN  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  12)  
(Date  unknown.)  According  to  the  Bollandists  there  are  two  Saints,  Damian,  whose Feasts  are  kept  on  Feb.  12  •  one,  a  soldier who  gave  his  life  for  his  religion  in  Africa, probably  at  Alexandria,  the  other,  a  Roman Martyr,  whose  body  was  found  in  the  cemetery of  St.  Callistus,  and  afterwards  taken  to  Salamanca in  Spain.  But  dates  and  particulars are  altogether  wanting.  

♦DAMHNADE  (St.)  V.  (June  13)  
(Date  uncertain.)  An  Irish  Virgin  famed for  miracles  and  greatly  venerated  in  Cavan, Fermanagh,  &c.  Colgan  identifies  her  with St.  Dympna,  the  Martyr  of  Gael  in  Belgium, but  he  can  scarcely  be  right,  as  neither  can  be iEngus,  who  makes  her  out  to  have  been sister  to  St.  Fursey.  Nothing  is  really  known of  her  life  or  date.  

DAMIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (April  12)  
(8th  cent.)  Of  noble  birth  and  early  distinguished for  learning  and  piety,  he  was (a.d.  680)  consecrated  Bishop  of  Pavia  in Lombardy.  He  strenuously  opposed  the  Monothelites,  heretics  of  the  time  who  taught  that in  Christ  there  was  no  human  will.  He  acted successfully  as  peacemaker  between  the  Byzantine Emperor  and  the  Lombards,  his  fellowcountrymen.  But  he  is  chiefly  in  honour  for his  devotedness  to  the  sick  and  to  the  poor, to  whom  he  ministered  personally  in  a  year  of plague.  By  his  kiss  he  is  said  to  have  healed a  leper.  He  went  to  his  reward  (A.D.  710), and  was  buried  in  his  Cathedral.

DANIEL  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  3)  
(2nd  cent.)  St.  Daniel,  a  deacon,  said  to have  been  of  Jewish  extraction,  aided  St. Prosdocimus,  first  Bishop  of  Padua,  in  his Apostolate  of  the  North-East  of  Italy.  An eloquent  preacher,  he  was  seized  and  tortured to  death  in  the  Fourth  General  Persecution (A.D.  168).  His  body  was  miraculously  discovered many  centuries  later  and  found  incorrupt. His  Festival  is  kept  on  Jan.  3,  that being  the  anniversary  of  the  Translation  of  his Relics  in  the  year  1064.  

DANIEL  and  VERDA  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  21)  
(4th  cent.)  Persian  Martyrs,  greatly  honoured in  the  East,  who  suffered  under  King  Sapor  II (A.D.  344).  

DANIEL  (St.)  M.  (July  10)  
See St. LEONTIUS  and  MARTYRS  OF ARMENIA.  

♦DANIEL  (St.)  (March  31)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Camaldolese  monk  at  Venice, a  German  by  birth.  He  was  murdered  by robbers  (A.D.  1411).  He  was  a  man  of  almost continuous  prayer  ;  and  while  still  in  the  world remarkable  for  the  sacrifice  he  made  of  all  his property  in  order  to  alleviate  the  misery  of  the poor.  

DANIEL  (St.)  Prophet.  (July  21)  
(5th  cent.  B.C.)  One  of  the  Four  Great Prophets,  and  the  inspired  writer  of  the  book under  his  name  in  Holy  Scripture,  of  which  the Church  recognises  some  sections  whose  Divine origin  was  unknown  to  the  Jews.  Besides what  is  therein  narrated,  tradition  holds  that the  holy  Prophet  did  not  return  into  Judaea with  his  fellow-countrymen,  but  remained  in Persia,  where  he  died,  a  centenarian.  The 76 

Roman  Martyrology  indicates  Babylon  as  the place  of  his  death,  but  his  tomb  is  still  shown at  Susa.  His  relics,  translated  to  Alexandria, are  now  venerated  at  Venice.  The  Greeks  keep his  Feast  on  Dec.  17,  together  with  that  of  the Three  Children  cast  into  the  fiery  furnace (Dan.  iii.). *DANIEL  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  11)  
(6th  cent.)  Consecrated  first  Bishop  of Bangor  by  St.  Dubritius,  he  governed  his  See with  zeal  and  success.  After  his  death  (a.d. 545)  the  Cathedral  at  Bangor  and  other  churches were  dedicated  in  his  honour.  He  was  buried in  the  Isle  of  Bardsey.  His  Festival  is  variously kept  on  Nov.  23  and  Dec.  1. DANIEL,  SAMUEL,  ANGELUS,  DOMNUS,  LEO, 
NICHOLAS  and  HUGOLINUS  (SS.)  MM.  

(Oct.  13)  
(13th  cent.)  St.  Daniel,  Provincial  in Calabria  of  the  newly-founded  Franciscan Order,  was  sent  by  St.  Francis  of  Assisi,  with six  of  his  brethren  to  preach  Christianity  to  the African  Mohammedans.  They  landed  at  Ceuta in  Morocco  and  at  once  applied  themselves  to their  holy  work ;  but  arrested  after  a  few  days and  at  first  treated  as  madmen,  they  were finally  sentenced  to  be  beheaded  (a.d.  1221). Their  bodies,  torn  to  pieces  by  the  populace, were  collected  by  Christians  and  later  carried over  to  Spain. DANIEL  THE  STYLITE  (St.)  (Dec.  11)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  famous  of  the Pillar-Saints  of  the  fifth  century.  He  entered a  monastery  near  Samosata  on  the  Upper Euphrates,  but  travelling  with  his  Abbot came  to  know  the  celebrated  St.  Simon  Stylites who  did  penance  on  the  top  of  a  pillar  near Antioch.  St.  Daniel,  resolved  on  imitating him,  and  encouraged  by  him,  embraced  the same  strange  form  of  austere  life  at  a  spot a  few  miles  outside  the  walls  of  Constantinople. He  lived  thirty  years  on  his  pillar,  whereon  he was  ordained  priest  and  used  to  say  Mass. Thereon  also,  honoured  by  the  Greek  Emperor and  the  idol  of  the  people  whose  sick  he  miraculously healed,  he  passed  away  a.d.  492, four  score  years  old. *DARERCA  (St.)  Widow.  (March  22)  
(5th  cent.)  St.  Patrick's  sister.  Her  name, derived  from  the  Irish  Diar-sheare,  signifying constant  or  firm  love,  denotes  her  characteristic in  God's  service.  At  what  date  in  the  fifth century  she  died  is  not  known.  She  is  reputed to  have  left  many  sons,  some  of  whom  became Bishops. DARIAS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  25)  

See  SS.  CHRYSANTHUS  and  DARIAS. DARIUS, ZOSIMUS, PAULUS and SECUNDUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  19)  
(Date  unknown.) Of  these  Martyrs,  the  old 
Martyrologies  make  mention  as  having  suffered 
at Nicsea,  but  nothing  is  extant  concerning 
them.  

♦DARLUGDACHA  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  1)  
(6th  cent.) The  successor  of  St.  Brigid  and second  Abbess  of  Kildare.  She  died  a.d.  524. The  legend  of  her  journeying  in  Scotland  seems devoid  of  evidence. DASIUS,  ZOTICUS, CAIUS and OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  21)  
(4th  cent.)  Fifteen  Christian  soldiers  who suffered  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  303  about)  at Nicomedia,  the  Imperial  residence  on  the Black  Sea.  After  undergoing  appalling  tortures they  were  taken  out  in  boats  and  cast  into  the sea. DASIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  At  Dorostorum  in  Mysia  (Asia Minor)  this  holy  Bishop,  as  in  duty  bound,  set his  face  and  authority  against  the  shameless immorality  practised  in  the  Saturnalia  and  other heathen  festivals.  His  zeal  cost  him  his  life, and  he  won  the  crown  of  martyrdom  under Diocletian  in  the  first  years  of  the  fourth century. 
DECLAN 

DATHIUS  (DATUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (July  3)  
(2nd  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Ravenna,  the miraculous  appearance  of  a  dove  hovering  over whose  head  had  led  to  his  election.  He  faithfully discharged  his  duty  to  his  flock  during  the respite  to  persecution  under  Commodus  and entered  into  rest  about  A.D.  190. DATIVA  (St.)  V.M.  (Dec.  6)  

See  SS.  DIONYSIA  and  DATIVA. DATIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  14)  
(6th  cent.)  Of  the  illustrious  family  of  the Alliati,  he,  because  of  his  piety  and  learning, was  appointed  Archbishop  of  Milan.  He  was  of invaluable  assistance  to  Pope  Vigilius  in  the dispute  about  the  "  Three  Chapters."  In  A.D. 551  he  took  part  in  the  Council  of  Constantinople and  in  the  condemnation  of  the  Patriarch  Mennas.  In  consequence  he  was  ill-treated  by  the Emperor  Justinian.  He  died  A.D.  552,  a  few months  after  his  return  to  his  See.  St.  Gregory the  Great  speaks  of  him  in  terms  of  honour and  esteem,  and  many  miracles  are  attributed to  his  intercession.  He  is  said  to  have  ordered to  be  written  the  History  of  the  Church  of Milan  known  as  the  "  Historia  Datiana. DATIUS, REATRIUS (RESTIUS) and OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  27)  
(5th  or  6th  cent.)  African  Martyrs  who suffered  under  the  Vandals.  These  barbarians under  Genseric  invaded  Africa  (A.D.  427),  the Roman  Provinces  having  been  betrayed  to  them by  Count  Boniface,  the  Governor,  who,  afterwards penitent,  vainly  sought  to  stay  their progress.  Hippona,  the  city  of  St.  Augustine, fell  in  the  year  431,  that  next  after  the  death of  the  holy  Doctor  ;  and  Carthage  was  taken A.D.  437.  The  Vandals  professed  Arianism and  persecuted  the  Catholics  cruelly  and persistently.  The  persecution,  begun  in  427, became  more  sanguinary  under  King  Hunneric (477-485)  and  cannot  be  said  to  have  ceased before  a.d.  534,  when  the  famous  leader  Belissarius  recovered  for  the  Emperor  Justinian  the Roman  Provinces  of  Africa  and  extinguished the  Vandal  Kingdom.  Of  the  earlier  phases  of the  persecution  we  have  particulars  from  the pen  of  the  contemporary  historian,  Victor Vitensis.  Procopius  may  also  be  referred  to.  

The  time,  precise  place,  and  circumstances  of the  martyrdom  of  St.  Datius  and  his  fellowsufferers  are  unknown. DATIVUS (DATIUS), JULIAN, VINCENT and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  27)  
(Date  unknown.)  These  holy  men,  thirty in  number,  are  usually  described  as  having suffered  for  Christ  in  Africa  in  the  third  century, but  Surius  believes  that  they  were  victims of  the  Vandal  persecution,  two  hundred  years later.  Another  and  perhaps  very  tenable opinion  holds  that  they  were  martyred  in Galicia  in  the  north-west  of  Spain,  and  as  early as  a.d.  95.  No  particulars  are  known.

♦DAVID  (St.)  Bp.  (March  1)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Wales  and perhaps  the  most  illustrious  of  the  ancient British  Bishops.  His  life  by  Giraldus  Cambrcnsis  is  very  unreliable,  and  the  traditions  concerning him  are  the  subject  of  much  merited criticism.  The  Breviary  approved  lessons describe  him  as  born  of  noble  parents  in  South Wales  and  educated  by  St.  Paulinus,  the  disciple of  St.  Germanus  of  Auxerre.  Later,  he  was  a strenuous  opposer  of  the  Pelagian  heresy,  and the  founder  of  the  See  of  St.  David's  or  Menevia. Thither,  when  appointed  successor  of  St. Dubritius,  he  transferred  the  chief  Welsh Bishopric  from  Caorleon.  He  is  said  to  have been  zealous  for  good  discipline  among  both clergy  and  laity,  and  to  have  presided  over  the Synod  of  Brewi.  The  middle  of  the  sixth  century is  rightly  given  as  the  time  of  his  death, 

that  of  a.d.  601,  adopted  by  Haddan  and Stubbs  from  the  Annales  Cambrenses  being clearly  impossible.  In  art  St.  David  is  often represented  preaching  on  a  hill  with  a  dove resting  on  his  shoulder.  

DAVID  (St.)  Hermit.  (June  26)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Saint  held  in  great  veneration in  the  Patriarchate  of  Constantinople,  whither he  is  reported  to  have  come  from  his  native Mesopotamia.  From  his  youth  upwards  a contemplative,  he  was  raised  by  Almighty  God to  a  high  degree  of  prayer,  and  privileged  to work  miracles.  He  settled  in  a  solitary  place outside  Thessalonica,  where  he  served  God  for seventy  years.  He  flourished  probably  in  the fifth  century,  though  there  is  much  uncertainty as  to  this.  His  relics  were  translated  to  Pavia in  a.d.  1054.  

♦DAVID  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  15)  
(10th  cent.)  An  Englishman  of  noble  birth who  followed  St.  Sigfried  into  Sweden  and  there governed  with  zeal  a  monastery  of  Benedictine monks.  He  died  at  a  great  age,  and  many miracles  have  been  worked  at  his  intercession.  

DAVID  (St.)  King.  Prophet.  (Dec.  29)  
(10th  cent.  B.C.)  In  the  First  and  Second Books  of  Kings,  and  in  Parallepomenon,  or Chronicles,  are  related  all  the  facts  which  God has  been  pleased  to  reveal  to  us  concerning  this man  "  after  His  own  Heart."  The  Book  of Psalms  almost  in  its  entirety  is  by  Holy  Church attributed  to  him,  "  the  sweet  singer  in  Israel." The  tomb  of  David  was  recognised  in  Jerusalem as  late  as  the  second  century  of  our  iEra,  when Hadrian  destroyed,  or  rather  attempted  to destroy  it,  as  it  is  still  pointed  out.  Josephus narrates  the  miracles  worked  thereat,  especially on  the  occasion  of  the  pillage  attempted  by Herod.  Eusebius  refers  to  the  endeavours  of Vespasian  to  uproot  the  House  of  David,  of whom  the  descendants  were  in  his  time  in  great consideration  among  the  Jews.  The  Greeks keep  the  Feast  of  St.  David  together  with  all the  other  Saints,  ancestors  of  Our  Blessed  Lord, on  Dec.  19.  The  reason  of  the  choice  of  Dec.  29 by  the  Latins  lies  probably  in  their  traditional reluctance  to  celebrate  the  Offices  of  Saints during  the  week  preceding  Christmas  Day.  

DAVINUS  (St.)  (June  3)  
(11th  cent.)  A  native  of  Armenia  who  selling all  that  he  had  and  giving  its  price  to  the  poor set  out  on  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome  and  to  St. James  of  Compostella  in  Spain.  On  his  journey he  was  hospitably  entertained  by  a  noble  matron of  Lucca  in  Tuscany.  But,  attacked  there  by a  fatal  malady,  he  succumbed  June  3,  A.D.  1051, and  was  buried  in  a  church  of  that  town.  His spirit  of  prayer  and  penance  earned  him  the honour  and  reputation  of  a  Saint.  His  cultus was  approved  (it  would  seem)  by  Pope  Alexander III.  

DECOROSUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  15)  
(7th  cent.)  For  thirty  years  Bishop  of  Capua in  Southern  Italy,  St.  Decorosus  was  one  of  the Prelates  who  assisted  at  and  signed  the  Acts of  the  Council  of  Rome  under  Pope  St.  Agatho (a.d.  680).  In  high  repute  of  sanctity,  he  died suddenly  before  the  altar  of  his  church  (A.D.  695).

(8th  cent.) A  Welsh  Saint  who  lived  a  holy

murdered  (a.d. 716).  No  reliable  particulars 
concerning  him  have  come  down  to  us.

(7th  cent.)  Irish  by  birth,  he,  with  St. Gallus,  followed  St.  Columbanus  into  Gaul  and took  part  in  the  foundation  of  the  Abbey  of Luxeuil.  But  when  his  master  was  driven  into Switzerland  and  Italy,  Deicola,  remaining behind,  founded  another  monastery  at  Lure in  the  Vosges  mountains,  where  he  died  in  great fame  of  sanctity  at  an  advanced  age  (A.D.  621).

(6th  cent.) A  Welsh  Saint,  founder  of  Bodfari  in  Flintshire.
♦DEINIOL  (St.)  (Sept.  11)  

Welsh  form  of  the  name  St.  DANIEL,  which see. DELPHINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  24)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Bordeaux  in  France, held  in  high  esteem  by  St.  Ambrose  and  other holy  men  of  his  time.  He  baptised  St.  Paulinus of  Nola,  whose  Epistles  addressed  to  St.  Delphinus  are  touching  in  their  expressions  of gratitude  and  veneration.  St.  Delphinus  assisted at  the  Spanish  Council  of  Saragossa (A.D.  380),  against  the  Priscillianist  heretics, whom  later  he  again  condemned  in  a  Synod  of his  own  (A.D.  385).  The  year  403  is  given  as that  of  his  death. DEMETRIA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  21)  
(4th  cent.)  Sister  of  St.  Bibiana  and  daughter of  SS.  Flavian  and  Dafrosa.  She  was  martyred in  Borne  under  Julian  the  Apostate  (a.d.  363), or  rather,  after  having  bravely  confessed  her Faith  in  Christ,  fell  dead  at  the  feet  of  the judge.  However,  as  elsewhere  noted,  there  is much  uncertainty  as  to  dates  and  details  in regard  to  all  the  facts  regarding  St.  Bibiana and  the  Saints  connected  with  her.  The  relics of  SS.  Bibiana  and  Demetria  are  enshrined  in the  church  in  Rome  dedicated  in  honour  of  the former  from  ancient  times.  It  was  restored  by Pope  Urban  VIII  in  the  seventeenth  century. DEMETRIUS,  CONCESSUS,  HILARY  and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  9)  
(Date  unknown.)  Baronius  notes  these Martyrs  as  having  suffered  in  Borne  ;  but  he cannot  support  his  statement  by  any  good  proof. The  older  manuscripts  register  them,  using  the phrase  :  "  Rome  and  elsewhere."  No  particulars concerning  any  of  them  have  come  down to  our  time. DEMETRIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  14)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Roman  and  other Martyrologies  describe  him  as  an  African Martyr,  and  in  support  of  this,  Baronius  appeals to  ancient  manuscripts  ;  but  nothing  is  known with  any  certainty  about  him. DEMETRIUS  (DIMITRI)  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  8)  
(4th  cent.)  Born  and  educated  at  Thessalonica  where  he  exercised  the  profession  of Rhetor  or  Public  Speaker,  he  made  many converts  to  Christianity.  Some  say  that  he became  a  high  Officer  of  State  and  even  a Proconsul ;  but  this  is  hardly  probable.  Arrested as  a  Christian  and  brought  before  Diocletian's colleague,  Galerius  Maximianus,  he appears  to  have  been  stabbed  to  death  without the  formality  attending  a  legal  execution.  This was  in  one  of  the  first  years  of  the  fourth century.  His  relics  are  in  great  veneration  in the  East,  and  a  magnificent  Basilica  was  soon after  his  martyrdom  erected  over  his  tomb at  Thessalonica.  The  Greek  Emperor  Michael IV  obtained a  notable  victory  over  the  Bul
78 

garians  through  his  intercession.  On  account of  the  many  miracles  that  have  taken  place  at his  shrine  St.  Demetrius  has  always  been  in great  honour  in  the  East,  and  his  name  is frequently  given  in  Baptism  to  children.  His Feast  is  there  kept  on  Oct.  26.  The  Acts of  St.  Demetrius  as  published  by  Surius  are manifestly  interpolated  and  cannot  be  relied upon  for  details. DEMETRIUS,  ANIANUS,  EUSTASIUS  and 
OTHERS  (S.S.)  MM.  (Nov.  10)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  band  of  twenty-two Martyrs  registered  as  having  suffered  at  Antioch in  Syria.  St.  Demetrius  is  described  as  a Bishop  and  St.  Anianus  as  his  deacon.  Nothing whatever  is  now  known  of  their  date  or  lives. DEMETRIUS  and  HONORIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  21)

describe  these  Saints  as  Christians,  who  were 
put  to  death  at  Ostia  at  the  mouth  of  the  Tiber.  

Nothing  more  has  come  down  to  us  about  them.

See  SS.  BLASIUS  and  DEMETRIUS. DEMETRIUS, HONORATUS and  FLORUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  22)  
(Date  unknown.)  They  are  stated  to  have suffered  at  Ostia  at  the  mouth  of  the  Tiber ; but  all  dates  and  particulars  have  been  long since  lost.  It  is  possible  that  these  SS.  Demetrius and  Honoratus  (though  the  names  are very  common)  may  be  identical  with  the  Saints of  the  same  names  venerated  on  Nov.  21.

(SS.)  MM.  (July  31)  
(Date  unknown.)  Baronius  describes  these Martyrs  as  having  suffered  at  Synnada  in Phrygia ;  but  the  Bollandists  think  it  more likely  that  they  were  African  Martyrs,  which was  also  the  judgment  of  Venerable  Bede. Nothing  beyond  their  names  has  come  down to  us. DEODATUS  (DIEUDONNE)  (St.)  Bp. (June  19)  
(7th  cent.) A  Bishop  of  Nevers  in  France 
who  resigned  his  See  and  embraced  the  life  of 
a  hermit.  He  passed  away  A.D.  679,  leaving 
his  name  to  the  town  of  St.  Di6.  

♦DENTLIN  (DENAIN)  (St.)  (March  16)  
(7th  cent.)  The  little  son  of  St.  Vincent  of Soignies  and  St.  Waltrude,  brother  of  SS. Landric,  Aldetrude  and  Madelberta.  Though only  seven  years  old  when  he  died,  he  is  in Belgium  with  them  venerated  as  a  Saint.  A church  in  the  Duchy  of  Cleves  is  dedicated  in his  honour.
♦DERFEL-GADARN  (St.)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Saint,  a  soldier,  and afterwards  a  hermit  at  Llanderfel  in  Merionethshire. He  was  greatly  venerated  by  the  Catholic Welsh. DEOGRATIAS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  12)  
(5th  cent.)  Consecrated  to  the  See  of  Carthage, A.D.  456,  after  it  had  remained  vacant for  fourteen  years  on  account  of  the  devastating persecution  of  the  Vandal  Arians  who  had  driven his  predecessor  St.  Quodvultdeus  into  exile. Genseric,  the  Vandal  King,  from  the  plunder of  Rome  and  Italy,  having  brought  many Romans  of  every  condition  of  life  prisoners to  Carthage,  St.  Deogratias  sold  all  that  he  or his  Church  possessed,  even  the  Sacred  Vessels of  the  Altar,  to  buy  them  back  to  liberty.  He moreover  fed  them  and  housed  them,  day  and night  visiting  the  sick  among  them.  But  being already  very  old  he  did  not  resist  long  the  many calls  on  his  endurance,  and  after  only  one  year of  such  strenuous  pastoral  labours,  died  a.d.  457. Victor  Vitensis,  the  historian,  writing  a  century later,  enlarges  on  his  merits  and  holiness. DERPHUTA  (St.)  M.  (March  20)

DIDACUS 

DESIDERIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  11)  
(7th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  born  at  Autun and  educated  at  Vienne,  who  became  successively Archdeacon  and  Bishop  of  the  latter city.  The  powerful  Queen  Brunehaut,  mother of  the  weak  Thierry  III,  had  him  exiled  and deposed  by  a  Synod,  but  four  years  afterwards, fearing  his  sanctity  and  popularity,  allowed him  to  return.  On  his  continuing  to  urge  the reform  of  the  morals  of  the  depraved  Court, Brunehaut  hired  three  assassins,  who  put  the holy  Bishop  to  death,  while  he  was  visiting  his Diocese  in  the  twelfth  year  of  his  Episcopate (May  23,  A.D.  608,  or,  according  to  some  historians, a.d.  612),  at  a  place  since  called  St. Didier  (the  French  form  of  the  name  Desiderius) de  Chalarone.  His  relics  were  enshrined  at Vienne  (a.d.  620).  St.  Desiderius  was  for  his age  a  distinguished  classical  scholar.  He  is one  of  the  Bishops  to  whose  protection  St. Gregory  the  Great  recommended  St.  Augustine and  his  companions  journeying  on  their  mission to  preach  Christianity  to  the  Anglo-Saxons of  Britain.  

DESIDERIUS  (St.)  M.  (March  25)  

See  SS.  BARONTIUS  and  DESIDERIUS.  

♦DERWA  (St.)  M.  

(Date  uncertain.)  The  Patron  Saint  of Menadarva  (Merthyr-Dava — The  Martyr  Derwa) in  Cornwall,  near  Camborne.  Nothing  is  now known  about  this  Saint.  Possibly  he  is  no other  than  St.  Dyfan  (Damian  or  Deruvianus), one  of  the  Missionaries  sent  to  Britain  in  the second  century  by  Pope  St.  Eleutherius.  

DESIDERIUS (DIDIER, DIZIER) of LANGRES (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (May  23)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  traditions  concerning this  Saint,  who  was  Bishop  of  Langres  in  France, are  so  conflicting  that  it  is  now  believed  that there  were  two  or  more  of  the  same  name connected  with  Langres.  Surius  assigns  to St.  Desiderius  a  date  in  the  third  century ; and  the  compilers  of  the  Gallia  Christiana  one in  the  fourth  ;  while  the  common  opinion  fixes his  Martyrdom  on  May  23,  A.D.  411.  All  agree that,  being  Bishop  of  Langres  in  NorthEastern Gaul,  during  a  raid  of  Teutonic  barbarians,  he boldly  sought  out  their  chieftain  to  beg  mercy for  his  flock,  but  was  forthwith  himself  struck down,  his  blood  staining  the  Book  of  the  Gospels he  held  in  his  hand.  With  him  perished  very many  of  his  faithful  people.  Numerous churches  are  dedicated  in  his  honour,  and  from him  the  town  of  St.  Dizier  takes  its  name.

See  SS.  JANUARIUS,  FESTUS, &c.  

♦DEUSDEDIT  (St.)  Bp.  (July  14)  
(7th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Honorius in  the  See  of  Canterbury,  over  which  he  presided with  zeal  and  charity  for  over  ten  years,  passing away  a  victim  of  the  great  Pestilence  of  a.d. 664.  

DEUSDEDIT  (St.)  (Aug.  10)  
(6th  cent.)  A  poor  shoemaker  in  Rome, contemporary  of  St.  Gregory  the  Great  (in  the latter  half  of  the  sixth  century),  of  whom  the holy  Pope  relates  that  he  worked  hard  all  the week  at  his  trade  and  on  each  Saturday  gave to  the  poor  all  his  earnings  beyond  what  was necessary  for  bare  sustenance  for  himself.  

DEUSDEDIT  (St.)  Abbot,  M.  (Oct.  9)  
(9th  cent.)  The  fifteenth  Abbot  of  the  great monastery  of  Monte  Cassino,  conspicuous  for learning  and  holiness  of  life.  He  was  especially liberal  as  an  almsgiver.  While  on  a  journey he  was  seized  and  held  to  ransom  by  a  robber baron,  but  so  maltreated  that  he  died  in  his prison  (a.d.  834).  Many  miracles  were  wrought at  his  tomb.  

DEUSDEDIT  (ADEODATUS)  (St.)  Pope.  (Nov.  8) (7th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Boniface  IV (a.d.  615).  He  ruled  the  Church  for  three years.  Though  little  is  known  of  the  details of  his  Pontificate,  his  self-sacrificing  devotedness to  his  flock  during  a  year  of  pestilence  endeared 

him  to  his  people  and  ensured  the  veneration of  his  memory.  He  is  said  to  have  been  the first  Pope  to  append  to  his  Decrees  the  leaden seals  or  Bullae  from  which  the  word  Bull, describing  them,  has  been  derived.  

DEUSDEDIT  of  BRESCIA  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  10)  
(7th  cent.)  The  last  of  the  canonised  Bishops of  Brescia  in  Lombardy.  He  was  a  strenuous opposer  of  the  Monothelite  heretics  (those  who denied  to  Christ  a  Human  Will),  and  took  part in  the  Councils  summoned  in  his  time  in  Italy to  deal  with  them.  He  died  some  time  between A.D.  679  and  A.D.  700.

♦DEVOTA  (St.)  V.M.  (Jan.  27)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  in  Corsica who  expired  on  the  rack  during  the  persecution under  the  Emperor  Diocletian  (a.d.  303).  Her remains  were  brought  by  a  priest  who  knew her  to  Monaco  on  the  Riviera,  of  which  town she  is  venerated  as  the  Patron  Saint.  

♦DEWI  (St.)  Bp.  (March  1)  

Otherwise  St.  DAVID  of  WALES,  which  see.  

DIACONUS  (St.)  M.  (March  14)  
(6th  cent.)  So  described  on  account  of  the office  (that  of  deacon)  he  held  in  the  Church  of the  Marsi  in  Central  Italy.  St.  Gregory  relates of  him  that  together  with  two  monks  he  was put  to  death  by  the  Lombards  what  time  they were  ravaging  Italy  in  the  sixth  century.  

♦DIARMIS  (DIERMIT,  DERMOT)  (St.)  (Jan.  18) Abbot.  

(6th  cent.)  Remarkable  from  his  earliest years  for  sanctity,  Diarmaid  became  spiritual director  and  teacher  to  St.  Kiernan  of  Clonmacnois,  and  later  founded  a  monastery  on Innis-Clotran  Island.  

♦DEYNIOLEN  (St.)  (Nov.  22)  
(7th  cent.)  He  is  also  known  as  St.  Deyniol the  Younger,  and  was  Abbot  of  Bangor  at  the time  of  the  slaughter  of  his  monks  and  destruction of  their  monastery  by  King  Ethelfrid  of Northumbria  after  the  Battle  of  Chester  (a.d. 616).  The  Saint  appears  to  have  escaped  the massacre  and  to  have  lived  on  till  about  A.d. 621.  

♦DICHU  (St.)  (April  29)  
(5th  cent.)  The  first  convert  made  by  St. Patrick  in  Ulster.  He  was  originally  a  swineherd. After  his  conversion  it  is  written  that he  continued  faithful  to  the  end  to  Christ  and St.  Patrick.  The  year  of  his  death  is  unknown.

(17th  cent.) A  Jesuit  Martyr  in  Japan,  who 
was  exposed  naked  on  a  frozen  lake  by  order  of

♦DIGAIN  (St.)  (Nov.  21)  
(5th  cent.)  A  son  of  Constantine,  king  or chieftain  of  Cornwall.  Llangernw  (Denbighshire), perpetuates  his  memory.  

DIDACUS  (DIEGO)  (St.)  (Nov.  12)  
(15th  cent.)  A  native  of  Seville  in  Spain, a  Franciscan  lay-brother,  who  attended  missionaries of  his  Order  to  the  Canary  Islands and  aided  them  effectually  in  their  Apostolate. Later  he  was  recalled  to  Spain,  where  he  died in  the  Convent  of  Alcala  in  Castile,  A.D.  1463. He  was  a  miracle  of  penance  and  contemplative prayer,  his  chief  devotion  being  to  Our  Lord in  the  Blessed  Sacrament,  and  to  the  Holy Mother  of  God.  The  many  miracles  worked  at his  tomb  led  to  his  canonisation  by  Pope Sixtus  V  in  the  year  1588.

(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  of  Todi  in Umbria  (Central  Italy),  who  during  the  persecution under  Diocletian  in  the  beginning  of  the fourth  century  lived  a  life  of  penance  and prayer  in  the  surrounding  mountains,  and acquired  a  great  reputation  for  holiness.

(3rd  cent.)  Roman  Martyrs  under  Uumcrian (A.D.  283).  They  are  mentioned  in  the  Acts  of SS.  Chrysanthus  and  Darias  ;  but  these  cannot be  trusted  for  accuracy  of  detail.  The  tradition is  that  they  were  walled  up  in  the  Catacombs  and 80 

there  left  to  die.  A  Feast  is  also  kept  on  Jan.  17 in  memory  of  the  finding  of  their  remains (A.D.  886).  These  Martyrs  are  described  as being  very  numerous.  In  fact,  it  appears  to have  been  a  case  of  a  Christian  Congregation surprised  while  assembled  for  prayer,  and disposed  of  by  having  the  entrance  to  their subterranean  Oratory  blocked  up.

Victor  of Utica,  in  his  History  of  the  Persecution,  gives  a graphic  account  of  the  fearful  ordeal  these  holy men  and  women  went  through.  Dionysia,  a widow,  perished  at  the  stake  with  her  little child  and  her  sister  Dativa.  iEmilian  (or Emilius),  a  physician,  and  Tertius,  a  monk, were  flayed  alive.

(Date  unknown.)  The  Roman  Martyrology describes  them  as  Armenian  monks  ;  but  there have  been  disputes  among  the  learned  as  to  the nationality  of  some  of  them.  In  reality  we  are no  longer  in  possession  of  anything  like  adequate evidence  bearing  on  their  date,  lives  or  martyrdom. DIONYSIUS  and  AMMONIUS  (SS.)  MM. (Feb.  14)  
(Date  unknown.)  Beyond  the  fact  that  the ancient  Martyrologies  commemorate  these Saints  as  having  been  beheaded  on  a  Feb.  14, and  seem  to  indicate  Alexandria  of  Egypt  as the  place  of  their  martyrdom,  nothing  whatever is  now  known  about  them.

Bp.  

(2nd  cent.)  A  famous  and  learned  Bishop of  Corinth  who  flourished  in  the  second  century of  our  Mia,  and  of  whose  letters  some  fragments have  been  preserved  to  us.  One  in  which  he bears  testimonv  to  the  martyrdom  on  the same  day  of  SS.  Peter  and  Paul  in  Rome  is

very  noteworthy.  St.  Dionysius  was  in  regular communication  with  St.  Soter  and  other  Popes of  his  age.  He  zealously  repressed  the  Marcionites  and  other  philosophising  heretics  of  his time.  The  Greeks  honour  him  as  a  Martyr (Nov.  20) ;  the  Latins  as  a  Confessor.  He died  before  A.d.  198,  when  we  find  his  successor at  Corinth  attending  a  Council.

DIONYSIUS  (DENIS)  (St.)  Bp.  (May  8)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  sixth  of  the  Bishops  of Vienne  in  Dauphine  (France).  He,  like  his  Ave predecessors,  has  been  commemorated  in  all  the Western  Martyrologies.  Ado,  himself  a  Martyrologist  and  Bishop  of  Vienne  in  the  ninth century,  tells  us  that  St.  Dionysius,  successor of  St.  Justus,  lived  till  the  reign  of  Pertinax (A.D.  193).  He  is  said  to  have  been  one  of  the ten  missioners  sent  into  Gaul  by  Pope  St.  Sixtus I,  early  in  the  century  with  St.  Peregrin  us. Some  have  erroneously  described  him  as  a Martyr.  

♦DIONYSIUS  of  AUGSBURG  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  26) (4th  cent.)  Venerated  as  the  first  Bishop  of Augsburg  in  Germany.  He  is  said  to  have  been converted  to  Christianity,  baptised  and  later consecrated  Bishop  by  St.  Narcissus.  He suffered  martyrdom  under  Diocletian  about A.D.  303.  

DIONYSIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  12)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Asiatic  by  birth  and  uncle  of the  youthful  Martyr,  S.  Pancras,  to  whom  he acted  as  guardian.  Coming  to  Home,  St. Dionysius  charitably  gave  shelter  to  the  Pope (either  St.  Marcellus  or  St.  Melchiades),  sought after  by  the  agents  of  the  persecuting  Emperor Diocletian.  With  his  nephew  he  was  rewarded by  the  grace  of  conversion  to  Christianity. Having  publicly  declared  themselves  servants of  Christ,  they  were  cast  into  prison,  where  we read  that  after  some  days  St.  Dionysius  rendered up  his  soul  to  God  (A.D.  304).

(4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Protasius  in the  See  of  Milan.  With  St.  Eusebius  of Vercelli  and  St.  Lucifer  of  Cagliari  he  was banished  into  Cappadocia  (A.D.  355)  by  the Arian  Emperor  Constantius.  Two  years  later, when  his  fellow-exiles  were  returning  to  their Churches  under  the  Emperor  J  ulian,  St.  Dionysius died  in  Asia,  where  he  had  acquired  a  high reputation  for  sanctity.  St.  Aurelius  the  local Bishop,  and  St.  Basil  the  Great,  enabled  St. Ambrose  to  effect  (A.D.  375)  the  Translation to  Milan  of  the  remains  of  his  holy  predecessor

DIONYSIUS  and  PRIVATUS  (SS.)  MM. (Sept.  20)  
(Date  unknown.) Beyond  the  Martyrology 
note  that  they  suffered  in  Phrygia  (Asia  Minor), 
nothing  has  reached  our  times  regarding  these 
holy  men.  

DIONYSIUS,  FAUSTUS,  CAIUS  (GAIUS),  PETER, PAUL  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  To  the  above  should  be  added the  names  of  St.  Eusebius,  Bishop  of  Laodicea, and  of  St.  Maximus,  successor  at  Alexandria  of St.  Dionysius.  By  some  error  these  Saints  are twice  commemorated  in  the  Roman  Martyrology, or  rather,  there  is  allotted  to  them  taken together  this  special  Feast  in  addition  to  that of  St.  Dionysius  (one  and  the  same  with  the famous  Bishop  of  Alexandria)  on  Nov.  17,  and to  that  of  St.  Faustus,  his  deacon,  on  Nov.  19. Banished  in  the  persecution  of  Decius  (A.D.  250) into  Libya,  all  these  Christians  were  again  in  a body  brought  to  trial  at  Alexandria,  under Valerian  (a.d.  257),  on  account  of  their  religion. Some  of  them  were,  it  would  seem,  stoned  to 

death,  and  others  died  in  prison.  In  one  of  his genuine  Epistles,  still  extant,  St.  Dionysius mentions  all  the  above  by  name  as  fellowsufferers  with  himself.  Venerable  Bode  by mistake  confuses  this  St.  Dionysius  or  Denis of  Alexandria  with  Denis  the  Areopagite  (Acts xvii.  34). DIONYSIUS,  RUSTICUS  and  ELEUTHERIUS (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  9)  
(1st  or  3rd  cent.)  It  has  been  the  fashion in  modern  times  to  date  the  martyrdom  of St.  Denis,  first  Bishop  of  Paris,  of  St.  Eleutherius,  his  priest  or  deacon,  and  of  St.  Rusticus, a  cleric,  his  companions,  as  having  come  to  pass in  the  course  of  the  third  century  in  the  persecution of  the  Emperor  Decius.  This  view  is based  on  the  authority  of  the  sixth  century historian,  St.  Gregory  of  Tours.  For  the arguments  in  its  favour,  Smith  and  Wace (besides  the  Bollandist  Acta  Sanctorum)  may be  consulted.  The  traditional  belief  that St.  Denis  was  sent  into  Gaul  to  evangelise  the country  by  Pope  St.  Clement  I  in  the  first century,  and  suffered  martyrdom  under  Domitian  or  Trajan,  especially  if  one  takes  into account  the  frequent  inaccuracies  of  St.  Gregory of  Tours,  seems  nevertheless  to  be  fairly  well authenticated.  Of  the  arguments  supporting it,  Abp.  Darboy's  work  and  Darras's  History of  the  Church,  have  excellent  summaries.  

As  to  the  facts  of  the  martyrdom  of  the Saint  and  his  fellow-sufferers,  we  know  little  or nothing  save  that  they  were  put  to  the  torture and  decapitated  near  Paris,  after  having  converted many  pagans  to  belief  in  Christ,  and  that their  bodies  cast  into  the  Seine  were  recovered by  their  disciples  and  buried  on  the  spot  where, several  centuries  later,  the  Merovingian  King Dagobert,  at  the  prayer  of  St.  Genevieve,  built the  famous  Abbey  of  St.  Denis. DIONYSIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  9)  
(1st  cent.)  This  is  Denis  the  Aeropagite, converted  by  St.  Paul  (Acts  xvii.  34),  and afterwards  first  Bishop  of  Athens.  A  Greek tradition  maintains  that  he  was  burned  alive under  Domitian  (a.d.  95).  But  an  opinion strongly  held  in  the  Middle  Ages,  and  still  ably defended,  identifies  him  with  the  St.  Denis asserted  to  have  been  sent  by  Pope  St.  Clement to  evangelise  Gaul,  and  martyred  at  Paris. His  authorship  of  the  wonderful  works  passing under  his  name,  which  have  laid  the  foundation in  the  West  of  both  Mystical  and  Scholastic Theology,  is  equally  or  even  more  controverted. It  has  become  usual  in  modern  times  to  attribute them  to  an  unknown  genius  of  the  fourth or  fifth  century.  And  doubtless,  as  we  have them,  they  are  seriously  interpolated.  Whoever be  their  author,  it  is  scarcely  possible (says  Baring-Gould)  to  speak  too  highly  of  their value  and  importance.  A  confusion  of  this St.  Denis  with  his  homonym  of  Alexandria  has led  Butler,  following  certain  ancient  Martyrologies, to  assign  his  festival  to  Oct.  3. DIONYSIUS  of  ALEXANDRIA  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  17)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  celebrated  Father  of  the Church  and  pupil  of  Origen,  who  became Patriarch  of  Alexandria  a.d.  248,  and  two  years afterwards  was  arrested  as  a  leader  of  Christians during  the  fierce  persecution  under  the  Emperor Decius.  He  escaped  into  hiding  in  the Libyan  Desert,  and  returned  to  Alexandria A.D.  251.  Under  Valerian  he  was  again  arrested and  again  banished ;  but  was  recalled  and restored  under  Gallienus.  He  died  at  Alexandria A.D.  265.  St.  Athanasius  styles  him "  the  Doctor  of  the  Catholic  Church."  He  was ever  zealous  for  the  Catholic  Faith,  and  easily justified  himself  when  accused  at  Rome  to  his namesake  Pope  St.  Dionysius.  The  fragments of  his  letters  still  extant  are  doctrinally  very valuable,  and  bear  abundant  evidence  to  his pastoral  zeal. DIONYSIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  20)

DIONYSIUS 
DIONYSIUS  (St.)  Pope.  (Dec.  26)  
(3rd  cent.) Perhaps  a  native  of  Calabria.  

In  early  life  he  embraced  the  monastic  state, 
but  later  was  enrolled  in  the  Roman  clergy, 
and  by  them  elected  Pope  (a.d.  259)  in  the  room 
of  the  Martyr,  St.  Sixtus  II.  St.  Basil  greatly 
extols  his  charity  to  the  poor,  and  St.  Denis  of 
Alexandria  (of  whom  he  had  had  occasion  to 
require  an  explanation  of  some  writings)  praises 
his  learning. He  denounced  Sabellianism  and, 
when  later  called  upon  by  the  Emperor  Aurelian 
to  judge  the  Rationalistic  Paul  of  Samosata, 
condemned  and  deposed  the  latter.  He  is  said 
to  have  rearranged  the  boundaries  of  the  Roman 
city  parishes. He  died  A.D.  269.  

DIOSCORIDES  (St.)  M.  (May  10)

See  SS.  VICTORINUS  and  DIOSCURUS. DIOSCURUS  (St.)  M.  (May  18)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Lector  or  Reader  in  one of  the  churches  of  Egypt,  who  in  one  of  the early  persecutions  was  arrested  and  subjected as  a  Christian  to  exceptionally  savage  tortures, such  as  the  tearing  out  of  his  nails  and  the burning  of  his  sides  with  torches.  A  miraculous intervention — a  dazzling  beam  of  light  from  a quarter  of  the  Heavens  opposite  to  that  in which  was  the  sun — is  said  to  have  startled  his executioners,  and  to  have  procured  him  a brief  respite  in  his  agony.  In  the  end  he  was burned  to  death  by  the  pressing  of  his  body between  red-hot  metal  plates.  This  is  all  that has  cone  down  to  our  time  respecting  St. Dioscurus.  Death  by  laminae,  or  sheets  of hot  metal,  was  an  accepted  form  of  execution in  Roman  times. DIOSCURUS  (St).  M.  (Dec.  14)

But  there  is  much  uncertainty  about  the  name.  

He  may  be  St.  Cadoc,  sometimes  called  Dockoe,

♦DOMANGARD  (DONARD)  (St.)  (March  24)

some  time  before  A.D.  500,  perhaps  even  in  the lifetime  of  St.  Patrick,  who  died  A.D.  464.

DOMINATOR  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  5)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Nothing  with  reference  to the  history  or  writings  of  this  Saint  has  been handed  down  to  us,  nor  is  it  known  for  certain in  what  century  he  lived.  Surius  puts  the  date of  his  death  a.d.  495.  He  was  the  fourteenth Bishop  of  Brescia  in  Lombardy,  and  succeeded St.  Rustician  in  that  See.  

DOMINIC  of  SORA  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  22)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Benedictine  Abbot  of  Sora in  the  old  Kingdom  of  Naples,  and  the  founder of  nine  monasteries.  He  was  famous  for  his sanctity  and  for  the  many  miracles  worked  by his  intercession  both  in  life  and  after  his  death (A.D.  1031).  

DOMINIC  DELLA  CALZADA  (St.)  (May  12)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Spanish  hermit  who  fixed his  abode  at  a  lonely  spot  in  Old  Castile,  which, from  his  having  constructed  there  a  hospice and  pilgrim's  road  to  Compostella,  acquired  the name  of  the  "  Calzada."  He  built  there  also a  chapel  to  Our  Blessed  Lady.  He  became  so famous  for  sanctity  and  miraculous  powers  that after  his  death  (a.d.  1109  or  perhaps  as  early as  a.d.  1060)  his  own  shrine  became  a  noted place  of  pilgrimage.  The  Bishopric  afterwards founded  at  Calzada  has  since  been  transferred to  Calahorra.  

DOMINIC  GUZMAN  (St.)  (Aug.  4)  
(13th  cent.)  The  mother  of  St.  Dominic, a  scion  of  the  illustrious  Guzman  family,  dreamt, before  his  birth  (A.D.  1170)  at  Calaruega  (Old Castile),  that  she  had  given  life  to  a  dog  bearing a  lighted  torch  which  was  setting  the  world  on fire.  Professed  as  a  Canon  Regular  in  the Reformed  Chapter  of  Osma,  he  helped  many Spanish  Bishops  to  restore  Ecclesiastical discipline  among  their  clergy.  In  attendance on  his  own  Bishop,  he  stayed  two  years  at Montpellier  in  the  South  of  France,  where  the immoral  heresy  of  the  Albigenses  was  then  at its  height  and  causing  tremendous  havoc. They  were  indefatigable  in  preaching  against  it, a  mission  which  St.  Dominic  continued  for eight  more  years,  after  the  return  of  the  Bishop to  Osma.  Many  were  the  miracles  he  worked  ; numberless  the  souls  he  converted  ;  far-reaching the  fruit  of  the  Rosary  devotion  he  established. In  the  end  he  began  his  great  Order  of  Preaching Friars,  which  with  that  of  the  Friars  Minor, founded  by  his  friend  and  contemporary,  St. Francis  of  Assisi,  was  the  chief  means  employed by  Almighty  God  to  renew  the  fervour  of Christians  during  the  later  Middle  Ages.  Popes Innocent  III  (a.d.  1215)  and  Honorius  III approved  and  confirmed  the  new  Institutes. To  St.  Dominic  was  allotted  in  Rome  the  ancient church  of  St.  Sixtus  for  his  first  convent.  He afterwards  ceded  it  to  his  nuns,  the  Friars passing  to  St.  Sabina's  on  the  Aventine.  The Saint  next  established  them  at  St.  James's  in Paris,  returning  to  Italy  in  a.d.  1218,  and fixing  his  residence  in  Bologna,  where  he  died (a.d.  1121),  and  where  his  relics  are  enslirined. In  his  lifetime  he  sent  missionary  Friars  to Morocco,  Portugal,  Sweden,  Norway,  Ireland, England  (where  the  convents  of  Canterbury, London  and  Oxford  date  from  then)  and  other countries.  Chief  among  the  miracles  bearing witness  to  his  sanctity  are  his  having  raised more  than  once  the  dead  to  life.  

DOMINIC  LORICATUS  (St.)  (Oct.  14)  
(11th  cent.)  An  Italian  Saint,  born  a.d.  995, and  from  the  outset  destined  by  his  parents for  the  clerical  state.  To  get  him  ordained  they wrongfully  made  a  present  to  a  Bishop  and  the young  priest  on  becoming  aware  of  this  crime of  simonv  (at  that  time  rife  in  Italy)  devoted himself  in  atonement  to  a  life  of  penance.  From the  circumstance  of  an  iron  cuirass  worn  constantly next  his  skin  having  been his chief 
DOMNINA 

instrument  of  self-torture,  he  acquired  the  name of  Loricatus.  He  first  retired  to  the  solitude  of Luceolo,  thence  passing  to  Montefeltro  in  the Apennines,  where  a  certain  Abbot  John,  with eighteen  disciples,  was  leading  a  terribly  austere life.  Finally,  he  entered  the  monastery  of Fonte  Avellano,  then  ruled  by  the  celebrated St.  Peter  Damian,  where  he  died  A.d.  1060. DOMINIC  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  20)  
(7th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Anastasius in  the  See  of  Brescia  in  Lombardy,  where, after  a  zealous  Pastorate,  he  passed  away  about a.d.  612.  St.  Charles  Borromeo  translated  and enshrined  his  relics. DOMINIC  of  SILOS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Dec.  20)  
(11th  cent.)  He  was  born  of  poor  parents  in Cantabria  (north-west  of  Spain).  He  was  at first  a  shepherd  ;  but  having  shown  great  piety and  aptitude  for  learning,  he  became  a  priest, and  embraced  a  hermit's  life  under  the  Rule of  St.  Benedict.  Elected  Prior  of  St.  Millan in  Aragon,  he  refused  to  surrender  certain  goods of  the  monastery  to  the  King  of  Navarre  and, banished  from  that  country  but  welcomed  by the  King  of  Castile,  was  appointed  by  him  Abbot of  St.  Sebastian's  at  Silos.  This  monastery  he thoroughly  reformed.  His  fame  spread  far  and wide  on  account  of  the  many  miracles  he wrought  in  his  lifetime.  After  his  holy  death (a.d.  1073)  he  miraculously  delivered  more  than three  hundred  prisoners  taken  by  the  Moors, and  his  shrine  is  still  decorated  with  many chains  brought  as  "  ex  votos.  

The  Countess  Guzman  having  recommended herself  to  his  intercession,  in  answer  to  his prayers,  gave  birth  (a.d.  1170)  to  the  great St.  Dominic,  founder  of  the  Order  of  Friars Preachers.  Even  to  our  day  the  Abbot  of  Silo brings  to  the  Queens  of  Spain,  when  in  labour, the  staff  of  St.  Dominic  which  remains  by  her bedside  till  the  birth  has  taken  place. DOMINIC,  VICTOR,  PRIMIANUS,  LYBOSUS, 
SATURNINUS, CRESCENTIUS, SECUNDUS 
and  HONORATUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  29)  
(Date unknown.) African Martyrs whose Acts  have  been  lost. DOMINICA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  6)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  probably  of Grecian  parentage,  who  for  having  destroyed idols  was  condemned  to  be  devoured  by  wild beasts,  but  being  uninjured  by  them  was beheaded.  There  is  much  uncertainty  about her  and  about  her  name,  winch  is  not  found in  the  older  Martyrologies,  but  it  is  generally agreed  that  she  suffered  under  Diocletian  at the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century.  The Roman  Martyrology  now  locates  her  martyrdom in  Campania ;  but  her  Breviary  legend  has  it that  it  took  place  at  Nicomedia,  and  that  her body  was  carried  by  Angels  to  Tropea  in Calabria,  where  from  time  immemorial  it  has been  venerated. DOMINICA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  21)  

Ordinarily and more properly written St. CYRIACA.  Similarly  CYRIACUS  is  not unfrequently  Latinised  DOMINICUS. DOMITIAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  1)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  in  Rome  about  a.d.  347, and  left  an  orphan  at  an  early  age,  he  gave  up his  possessions  to  the  poor  and  retired  to  one of  the  monasteries  in  the  city.  Thence  he passed  into  Gaul  and  received  the  priesthood in  the  famous  Abbey  of  Lerins.  Later,  we  find him  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Lyons,  where  he built  a  little  Oratory  dedicated  to  St.  Christopher, and  lived  some  time  as  a  hermit.  Finally, he  founded  the  monastery  of  Bebron,  now St.  Rambert  de  Joux,  where  he  died  in  extreme old  age  towards  the  middle  of  the  fifth  century. Extant  sources  of  information  concerning St.  Domitian  are  very  unsatisfactory.  Such particulars  as  we  have  come  mainly  through Trithemius,  a  comparatively  modern  author, who  avers  that  he  had  seen  the  Acts  of  the Saint. 

DOMITIAN  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  1)  

See  SS.  CYRIL,  AQUILA, &c. DOMITIAN  of  CHALONS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  9)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  third  Bishop  of Chalons-sur-Marne  in  France,  remarkable  for his  zeal  and  success  in  the  conversion  of  the heathen.  He  entered  into  his  rest  towards  the close  of  the  fourth  century  and  was  buried  in the  same  grave  as  his  predecessors,  St.  Memmius (Menge)  and  St.  Donatian,  of  the  latter  of  whom he  was  a  disciple  in  Rome.  But  Baronius  and the  old  traditions  antedate  all  three  Saints  by two  centuries  and  probably  with  good  reason. DOMITIAN  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  28)  

See  SS.  EUTYCHIUS  and  DOMITIAN. DOMITILLA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  7)  

More  correctly  ivritten  St.  FLA  VIA  DOMITILLA, which  see. DOMITIUS, PELAGIA, AQUILA, EPARCHIUS 
and  THEODOSIA  (SS.)  MM.  (March  23)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Domitius  was  a  Phrygian, and  died  by  the  sword  under  J  ulian  the  Apostate (a.d.  361),  probably  at  Caesarea  in  Palestine.  St. Domitius  is  said  to  have  provoked  his  own  arrest by  publicly  attacking  the  errors  of  heathenism in  the  Circus  where  the  people  were  gathered for  the  festival  games  held  in  honour  of  the  gods. With  him  several  other  Christians  suffered. DOMITIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  5)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Persian  or,  as  some  say,  a Phrygian,  converted  at  Nisibi  in  Mesopotamia, who  embraced  the  monastic  life  and  later retired  into  a  cave,  somewhere  in  Asia  Minor, where  he  converted  to  Christianity  many  of the  neighbouring  country  people.  Julian  the Apostate,  irritated,  it  is  alleged,  by  the  reproaches Domitius  ventured  to  address  to  him, had  him  stoned  to  death  (a.d.  362).  Two  of  his disciples  suffered  with  him.  St.  Gregory  of Tours  mentions  a  St.  Domitius  of  Syria ;  but it  is  not  clear  that  he  is  identical  with  the  St. Domitius  of  July  5.  The  latter,  however,  may be  very  well  one  and  the  same  with  the  St. Dometius  or  Domitius  commemorated  in  the Roman  Martyrology  on  Aug.  7. DOMITIUS  (DOMETIUS)  and  OTHERS  (Aug.  7)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  The  entry  in  the  Roman  Martyrology is :  "At  Nisibis  in  Mesopotamia  St. Domitius,  a  Persian  monk  who  with  two  of  his disciples  was  stoned  to  death  under  Julian  the Apostate."  But  modern  criticism  has  great difficulty  in  accepting  this  St.  Domitius  or Dometius  as  other  than  the  Martyr  of  the  same name  commemorated  on  July  5.  Julian  the Apostate  was  never  at  Nisibi.  On  the  other hand,  it  is  fairly  clear  that  this  Saint  Domitius the  Hermit  is  not  the  Phrygian  soldier-saint venerated  on  March  23. DOMITIUS  (St.)  (Oct.  23)  
(8th  cent.)  A  priest  of  the  Diocese  of  Amiens, who  retired  into  a  solitude  where  he  practised austere  penance.  He  flourished  either  in  the seventh  or  in  the  eighth  century  of  our  Era. But  the  Lives  we  have  of  him  are  of  late  date and  little  reliance  is  to  be  placed  upon  them. Surius  maintains  and,  it  would  seem,  with  good reason,  that  St.  Domitius  was  not  a  priest  but only  a  deacon,  and  as  such  he  is  described  in the  Proper  Lections  of  his  Office.

VV.MM.  

(Date  uncertain.)  Virgin  Martyrs  who  suffered at  Teramo  or  perhaps  at  Terni  in  Umbria, probably  about  the  middle  of  the  third  century, at  the  same  time  as  their  Bishop  St.  Valentine. All  the  Martyrologies  commemorate  them,  but whether  there  were  not  in  the  same  locality two  or  more  Virgin-Martyrs  by  name  Domnina

DOMNINA 
is  altogether  uncertain.  Jacobilli  contends  for a  Domnina  Martyr  under  Totila  at  Teramo  in the  sixth  century.  

DOMNINA  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  12)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  woman  who,  after cruel  torments,  died  in  prison  at  Anazarbus  in Cilicia,  Lysias  being  Prefect,  A.D.  303.  The Roman  Martyrologist  must  have  used  a  corrupt manuscript  in  which  Lycia  was  substituted  for Lysias,  as  he  places  St.  Domnina's  martyrdom in  the  Province  of  that  name.  

DOMNINUS  (St.)  M.  (March  21)  

See  SS.  PHILEMON  and  DOMNINUS.  

DOMNINUS,  VICTOR  and  OTHERS  (March  30) (SS.)  MM.  

(Date  uncertain.)  St.  Domninus  suffered various  torments  under  Maximian  Herculeus, the  colleague  of  Diocletian  in  A.D.  300,  and gave  his  life  for  Christ  at  Thessalonica,  together with  Philocalus,  Achaicus  and  Palotinus.  The Greeks  keep  their  Feast  on  Oct.  1 ;  and  the St.  Domninus  commemorated  on  that  day  in  the Roman  Martyrology  is  probably  one  and  the same  with  the  Martyr  of  March  30,  inserted there  by  mistake.  St.  Victor  and  his  companions (in  all  about  ten  in  number)  suffered elsewhere,  but  the  place  and  the  date  are  alike unknown,  though  the  Greek  manuscripts  specify the  names  of  several  among  them  and  give particulars  about  them.  

DOMNINUS  (St.)  (April  20)  

See  SS.  MARCELLINUS  AND  DOMNINUS.  

DOMNINUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  1)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  who  suffered  at Thessalonica  about  A.D.  300  under  Maximinian or  Diocletian.  He  is  in  all  probability  the same  as  the  St.  Domninus  commemorated  with others  on  March  30.  

DOMNINUS  (DONNINO)  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Parma  in  Italy who,  while  trying  to  escape  a  band  of  soldiers sent  to  arrest  him,  was  overtaken  and  beheaded on  the  Via  Claudia  or  iEmilia,  a  few  miles  out of  Parma  at  a  place  now  called  after  him  Borgo San  Donnino,  where  his  relics  are  venerated  to this  day.  His  martyrdom  is  alleged  to  have taken  place  A.D.  304 ;  but  the  narration  accepted in  the  Middle  Ages  as  the  Acts  of  St.  Domninus is  altogether  untrustworthy.  

DOMNINUS,  THEOTIMUS.  PHILOTHEUS,  SYLVANUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  5) (Date  uncertain.)  This  St.  Domninus  was  a young  man  said  to  have  been  a  physician,  at first  condemned  to  work  in  the  mines,  but afterwards  burned  to  death  somewhere  in Palestine.  SS.  Theotinvus  and  Philotheus appear  to  have  suffered  elsewhere  and  at another  time.  St.  Sylvanus,  a  Syrian  Bishop, was  condemned  to  the  mines  together  with St.  Domninus,  but  wa3  martyred  much  later. A  St.  Sylvanus  is  commemorated  as  having suffered  at  Rome  on  May  5,  and  it  may  possibly be  he.  All  these  holy  men  are  said  to  have confessed  Christ  under  the  Emperor  Maximian. Most  authors  understand  Maximin  Daza  and date  this  martyrdom  A.D.  310.  Surius,  however, thinks  Maximin  the  Thracian  to  be  referred  to, and  dates  it  A.D.  237  or  A.D.  238.  

DOMNIO  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  11)  
(1st  cent.)  Tradition  has  it  that  St.  Domnio, a  Syrian,  was  one  of  the  seventy-two  disciples chosen  by  Christ  to  go  before  His  Pace  (Luke  x. 1),  and  that  he  came  to  Rome  with  St.  Peter ; that  he  was  afterwards  sent  by  the  Apostle into  Dalmatia,  where  he  evangelised  the  country on  the  Eastern  shores  of  the  Adriatic,  and  in  the end  was  beheaded  by  order  of  the  Imperial Prefect,  Maurelius,  together  with  eight  soldiers, converts  made  by  him.  His  relics  are  still honoured  at  Salona,  though  the  Church  of  St. John  Lateran  in  Rome  has  claimed  to  possess a  large  portion  of  them  since  the  time  of  Pope John  IV  (A.D.  641).  It  appears  historically certain  that  this  Pontiff  did  cause  to  be  brought to  Rome  the  body  of  a  Martyr,  Domnio  by  name.

DOMNIO  (St.)  M.  (Julv  16)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Domnio,  a  zealous  Christian, was  beheaded  at  Bergamo  in  Lombardy  under Maximian  Herculeus,  the  colleague  of  Diocletian, towards  the  end  of  tbe  third  century.  Thus, the  local  historians  ;  but  it  must  be  "confessed that  no  ancient  Martyrology  so  much  as  mentions his  name.  Of  his  niece,  St.  Eusebia, Virgin-Martyr,  the  Feast  is  similarly  kept  at Bergamo  (Oct.  29). DOMNIO  (St.)  (Dec.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  A  saintly  priest,  member  of  the Roman  clergy  in  the  latter  half  of  the  fourth century.  St.  Jerome,  who  dedicated  to  him some  of  his  works,  styles  him  "  a  most  holy man,  the  Lot  of  our  times,"  and  St.  Augustine speaks  of  him  as  "  truly,  a  most  holy  Father." Popular  veneration  no  doubt  canonised  him immediately  after  his  passing  to  a  better  life,  and secured  him  a  place  in  the  Roman  Martyrolocv. *DOMNOC  (St.)  (Feb.  13)

(6th  cent.)  A  holy  Religious  who  from  having been  Abbot  of  a  monastery  near  Paris,  was called  (A.D.  543)  to  be  Bishop  of  Le  Mans (Cenomanensis)  in  the  West  of  France.  His life  of  prayer  and  penance,  his  zeal  for  the  good of  his  people  and  his  great  love  of  the  poor  made him  conspicuous  for  sanctity  among  the  prelates who  with  him  assisted  at  the  celebrated  Council of  Tours  (A.D.  566).  He  died  A.D.  581,  having founded  many  monasteries,  hospitals  and chinches. DOMNUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  13)  

See  SS.  DANIEL  and  FRANCISCAN  MARTYRS. DOMNUS  of  VIENNE  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  3)  
(6th  cent.)  St.  Ado,  one  of  the  successors of  St.  Domnus,  relates  in  his  Chronicle  that St.  Domnus  succeeded  St.  Desidexius  the Martyr,  in  the  Bishopric  of  Vienne  in  France ; and  that  he  was  a  prelate  of  surpassingly  holy life,  distinguished  by  his  charity  to  the'  poor, and  zealous  in  the  redeeming  of  the  captives taken  in  the  incessant  wars  of  the  period.  He died  A.D.  527.  We  know  nothing  more  about him.  His  Feast  is  not  kept  in  the  Liturgy, not  even  locally. *DONALD  (DONIVALD)  (St.)  (July  15)  
(8th  cent.)  A  holy  man  in  Scotland  who with  his  nine  daughters  led  the  life  of  a  Religious at  Ogilvy  in  Forfarshire.  Various  memorials of  the  nine  maidens  remain  to  this  day  in Scotland. DONARD  (St.)  (March  24)

(Date  unknown.) A  band  of  Christian  women put  to  death  for  the  Faith  in  Rome  in  one  of the  early  persecutions,  and  whose  relics  were enshrined  with  those  of  other  Martyrs  in  the Catacombs  of  the  Via  Salaria.  Beyond  their names  duly  registered  in  the  official  Martyrologies  nothing  is  known  about  them. DONATIAN  and  ROGATIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (May  24) (3rd  cent.)  Two  brothers  of  Nantes  in  Brittany, put  to  death,  by  Rictius  Varus,  Governor of Gaul, for the crime of being Christians (a.d.  299)  during  the  great  persecution  under Diocletian. DONATIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  7)  
(Date uncertain.) The second Bishop of 
DOROTHEUS 

Chalons-sur-Marne,  disciple  and  successor  of St.  Memmius  (Menge),  the  founder  of  the  See, whose  deacon  he  was.  Baronius  and  the  old tradition  holds  that  St.  Memmius  was  sent  into Gaul  by  St.  Peter  (a.d.  46)  and  consequently that  St.  Donatian  flourished  in  the  first  and second  centuries  of  our  era.  Surius  and  the moderns  substitute  Pope  St.  Fabian  for  St. Peter.  Consequently  St.  Donatian  would  have lived  in  the  third  century.  A  Donatian,  Bishop of  Chalons,  assisted  at  a  Council  of  Cologne A.D.  346.  All  agree  that  he  was  a  zealous  and able  Bishop,  but  evidently  he  is  other  than  the Saint  of  August  7. DONATIAN,  PRiESIDIUS, MANSUETUS,  GER
MANUS,  FUSCULUS and  L^ETUS  (SS.)  MM.  

(Sept.  6)  
(5th  cent.)  Some  of  the  more  conspicuous among  the  Catholics  driven  from  Africa  into exile  by  Hunneric,  the  Arian  King  of  the Vandals  (A.D.  484),  of  whom  a  particular  account is  given  by  Victor  of  Utica  in  his  History of  that  Persecution.  It  is  said  that  they numbered  in  all  nearly  five  thousand  in  a  single year.  Lsetus,  a  Bishop  and  a  most  zealous Prelate,  was,  however,  burned  to  death  at  the stake  ;  the  others,  part  priests,  part  laymen, scourged  and  banished. DONATIAN  (DONAS)  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  14)  
(4th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Bruges  in Belgium,  whither  his  relics  were  translated  in the  ninth  century.  He  was  a  Roman  by  birth, and  Bishop  of  Reims  from  A.D.  360  to  A.D.  390, between  SS.  Maternus  and  Viventius,  and appears  in  life  as  after  death  to  have  been  in high  repute  of  sanctity.  But  no  trustworthy account  of  him  has  come  down  to  our  age.

See  SS.  POLYEUCTE,  VICTORIUS,  <vx. DONATUS  and  HILARY  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Donatus,  Bishop  of  Arczzo in  Tuscany,  is  commemorated  liturgically  on Aug.  7.  He,  with  Hilary  (or  Hilarimis),  a monk,  uas  put  to  death  for  the  Faith  under Julian  tin apostate  (a. it.  :>(;i).  Hilary  was scourged  to  death ;  Donatus  was  beheaded. St.  Gregory  and  others  relate  the  many  miracles wrought  by  these  holy  men,  among  wliich  the

DONATUS  (St.)  (Aug.  19)  
(6th  cent.)  A  deacon,  native  of  Orleans  in France,  who  lived  the  life  of  a  hermit  on  Mount Jura  near  Sisteron  in  Provence,  and  was renowned  for  his  sanctity  and  for  the  miracles worked  by  his  prayers.  He  died  towards  the year  535.

(9th  cent.)  By  birth  an  Irishman,  who,  on his  return  from  a  pilgrimage  he  had  made  to Rome,  while  passing  through  Tuscany,  was  on account  of  his  virtues  and  learning  made Bishop  of  Fiesole  near  Florence.  He  died about  A.D.  874  after  nearly  half  a  century  of Episcopate.  He  is  said  to  have  left  some poems,  besides  prose  writings  ;  but  nothing  of them  now  remains.  

DONATUS  of  CORFU  (St.)  (Oct.  29)  
(Date  unknown.)  All  we  know  of  this  Saint is  that  about  A.D.  600  St.  Gregory  the  Great directed  that  his  relics,  brought  to  Corfu  by some  refugee  priest  from  Asia  Minor,  should  be reverently  enshrined  in  one  of  the  churches  of the  island.

DOROTHEA  (DOROTHY)  (St.)  V.M.  (Feb.  6)  
(4th  cent.)  The  famous  Virgin-Martyr  of Csesarea  in  Cappadocia,  who  was  racked, scourged  and  beheaded  under  Diocletian,  about a.d.  300,  and  whose  relics  are  now  venerated in  Rome.  She  converted  to  the  Christian  Faith the  very  persons  sent  to  persuade  her  to  renounce it.  She  is  represented  with  fruit  and  flowers, in  allusion  to  a  lawyer  having  mockingly  asked her  to  send  him  "  roses  and  apples  "  from  the garden  of  her  Heavenly  Bridegroom,  and  to  his having  mysteriously  received  them  on  the  day of  her  martyrdom  amid  the  snows  of  a  Cappadocian  winter.  The  cultus  of  St.  Dorothy appears  to  have  been  curiously  neglected  in  the East.

DOROTHEUS  of  TYRE  (St.)  M.  (June  5)  
(4th  cent.)  There  is  much  uncertainty  as  to the  true  history  of  this  Saint.  The  Roman Martyrology  adopts  the  view  that  he  was  a priest  of  Tyre,  imprisoned  and  otherwise  made to  suffer  for  the  Faith  in  the  great  persecution at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century,  and  who survived  to  undergo  banishment  under  Julian the  Apostate  (A.D.  362)  dying  at  Verya  on  the Black  Sea  at  the  age  of  107.  The  Bollandists (probably  with  reason)  make  him  Bishop  of Tyre,  and  one  of  the  Fathers  of  the  Council of  Nicaea  (A.D.  325).  He  is  said  to  have  written in  Greek  and  in  Latin  and  on  several  subjects  ; but  it  is  curious  that  neither  Eusebius  nor St.  Jerome,  his  contemporaries,  make  any mention  of  him.

Diocletian  and  officials  of  his  Court  of  Nicomedia  in  Asia  Minor,  whom  he  sacrificed  to  his hatred  for  the  Christian  religion,  causing  them to  be  put  to  the  torture  and  eventually  hanged (a.d.  303).  Eusebius  of  Csesarea,  a  contemporary, has  left  us  a  detailed  and  trustworthy account  of  their  sufferings.  The  body  of St.  Gorgonius  was  translated  to  Rome  under Pope  St.  Gregory  IV  (827-844).  Hence  it  has come  about  that  he  is  not  only  registered  in the  Roman  Martyrology,  but  liturgically  commemorated each  year. DOSITHEUS  (St.)  (Feb.  23)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  solitary,  a  simple and  unlearned  man,  whose  weak  health  hindered him  from  practising  the  austerities  of  his fellow-monks,  but  who  nevertheless  by  prayer and  self-denial  attained  to  great  sanctity. The  Lives  of  the  Fathers  of  the  Desert  give interesting  particulars  concerning  him.  
♦DOTTO  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  9)  
(6th  cent.) A  Saint  who  has  left  his  name  to 
one  of  the  Orkney  Islands,  where  he  is  said  to 
have been head of a monastery.  Nothing 
certain  is  known  about  him.  

♦DONNAN  (DOUNAN)  and  OTHERS  (April  17)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(7th  cent.)  St.  Donnan,  an  Irish  Saint, following  the  example  of  St.  Columba,  settled with  his  disciples  on  Egg  Island,  off  the  Western coast  of  Scotland.  He  and  fifty-two  of  his companions  were  done  to  death  by  the  heathen Picts.  From  the  traditional  connection  between St.  Donnan  and  St.  Columba  the  date  of  the Passion  of  these  holy  Martyrs  may  safely  be put  at  the  end  of  the  sixth  or  beginning  of  the seventh  century.

(6th  cent.)  Patron  Saint  at  Llandrillo (Denbigh)  and  at  Llandrillo  (Merioneth).  He appears  to  have  been  a  sixth  century  Saint, son  of  an  Armorican  chief  in  Brittany,  and  to have  lived  as  a  monk  at  Bardsey. *DRITHELM  (St.)  (Aug.  17)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Northumbrian,  who  after leading  a  reprehensibly  worldly  life,  was  terrified by  a  vision  of  the  Judgment  to  come  and of  Hell.  In  consequence  of  this  he  embraced a  career  of  severe  penance  as  a  monk  of  Melrose, persevering  therein  to  the  day  of  his  holy  death, about  A.d.  700. DROCTOVEUS  (DROCTONIUS)  (St.) (March  10)  

Abbot.  

(6th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Germanus  of Paris,  who  became  Abbot  of  the  monastery  of St.  Symphorian  at  Autun,  a  Religious  House in  which  a  Rule  was  followed  modelled  upon that  of  the  Solitaries  of  Egypt.  When  St. Germanus  had  become  Bishop  of  Paris  and King  Childebert  had  founded  the  Abbey  of St.  Vincent  (since  called  St.  Germain  des  Pres) St.  Germanus  set  St.  Droctoveus  over  it.  He ruled  the  monastery  till  his  death  at  the  age  of forty-five  (about  A.D.  580),  "  the  embodiment (so  the  chroniclers  describe  him)  of  Christian and  monastic  perfection."  Venantius  Fortunatus  has  left  us  some  lines  of  verse  in  praise of  St.  Droctoveus. *DRAUSINUS  (DRAUSIUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  5)  
(7th cent.)  A native of Soissons and a Bishop  of  that  city.  He  died  A.D.  675,  and  is locally  venerated  as  a  Saint. DROGO  (DREUX,  DRUON)  (St.)  (April  16)  
(12th  cent.)  One  of  the  Patron  Saints  of shepherds.  He  lost  both  parents  at  birth, and  when  twenty  years  of  age  disposed  of  all his  property  to  embrace  a  life  of  utter  poverty. For  more  than  twenty  years  he  tended  the cattle  of  a  rich  and  pious  lady,  busying  himself at  the  same  time  with  practices  of  prayer  and penance.  He  is  said  to  have  made  nine  times the  pilgrimage  to  Rome.  Finally,  he  built himself  a  hut  against  the  church  of  Sebourg  in

Bp.  (Nov.  14)  
(6th  cent.)  A  famous  Welsh  Saint,  of  the race  of  Brychan  and  the  founder  of  monachism in  Wales.  He  was  Bishop  of  Llandaff  and Archbishop  of  Caerleon,  which  latter  See  he resigned  to  the  yet  more  celebrated  St.  David. St.  Dubritius  is  said  to  have  been  consecrated Bishop  of  St.  Germanus  of  Auxerre.  He  died probably  about  the  middle  of  the  sixth  century, and,  as  it  would  appear,  in  the  Isle  of  Bardsey, to  which  he  had  retired  in  his  old  age.  His relics  were  solemnly  translated  A.d.  1120.  

DULA  (St.)  V.M.  (March  25)

DULAS  (TATIAN)  (St.)  M.  (June  15)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Zephyrinum  in Cilicia  (Asia  Minor),  put  to  death  in  the  great persecution  under  Diocletian  about  A.d.  300. His  Acts  and  the  relation  of  Metaplirastes  give a  graphic  description  of  the  frightful  tortures to  which  St.  Dulas  was  put,  a  sample  of  what also  many  other  Christians  endured  in  that terrible  age  of  trial.  He  was  savagely  scourged back  and  front,  then  half-roasted  on  a  gridiron and  so  dismissed  to  his  dungeon.  Next  day, the  proceedings  began  by  the  piling  of  burning charcoal  on  his  head ;  after  which  he  was hung  up  by  his  wrists  and  his  body  was  torn with  iron  rakes,  so  that  his  flesh  hung  down in  ribbons  and  his  bowels  were  exposed.  Then the  dying  man  was  ordered  to  be  dragged  to Tarsus,  the  chief  city  of  Cilicia  for  the  continuing of  his  execution.  Happier  in  this  than  some  of his  fellow-Christians,  Dulas  expired  on  the  way. Over  his  body  thrown  into  a  ditch,  a  sheepdog is  said  to  have  stood  guardian,  until  eventually the  Christians  found  and  reverently  interred his  remains.  As  we  find  stated  in  the  report of  the  Interrogatory  through  which  he  was  put by  the  judges,  Dulas  was  only  a  sort  of  nickname given  him  ;  his  real  name  was  Tatian.

He  was  a  man  of  singular piety  and  was  highly  favoured  with  supernatural gifts.  In  his  time  the  Roman  tonsure and  the  Roman  date  of  Easter  were  finally adopted  by  the  Celtic  monks  in  Scotland. a.d.  717  is  given  as  the  year  of  his  death.

In  his  monastery he  lived  in  great  fervour,  dividing  his  time between  prayer,  study  and  manual  labour. Under  King  Edmund,  he  was  appointed  Abbot ; but,  having  rebuked  the  unworthy  King  Edwy for  his  shameless  life,  was  afterwards  forced into  a  year's  exile  in  Flanders.  Of  Edgar  the Peaceful  he  was  a  favourite  and  a  chief  adviser, and  during  his  reign  was  made  successively Bishop  of  Worcester  (A.D.  957)  and  Archbishop of  Canterbury  (A.D.  961).  Moreover,  Pope John  XII  appointed  Dunstan  his  Legate  in England.  The  Saint  never  faltered  in  the execution  of  his  duty,  and  did  not  spare  even his  Royal  Patron,  guilty  at  least  on  one  occasion of  flagrant  immorality.  By  his  "  Canons " St.  Dunstan  did  much  to  restore  Ecclesiastical discipline  in  England,  where  his  influence worked  immense  good.  He  expired  calmly, May  19,  A.D.  988,  and  was  buried  at  Canterbury.

His  name  has  been  Latinised  into  Deruvianus or  Daraian ;  or  rather  it  is  some  such  Latin appellation  which  has  been  rendered  into  the Celtic  Dyfan.  His  church  of  Merthyr  Dyfan shows  the  popular  tradition  that  he  ended  his days  by  martyrdom.

She  settled  at  Gheel,  a  village  in  the present  Province  of  Brabant,  and  devoted herself  to  works  of  charity.  Her  father  pursued her  and  murdered  both  the  Saint  and  the  old priest  who  had  advised  and  accompanied  her. At  her  shrine  lunatics  and  those  possessed  by devils  were  often  miraculously  cured  ;  and  in art  she  is  frequently  represented  as  dragging away  a  devil.  She  is  the  Patron  Saint  of  the insane  ;  and  Gheel  to-day  is  famous  for  asylums for  lunatics,  which  arc  among  the  best  managed establishments  of  the  sort.

Towards  the  close  of  his  life he  enshrined  afresh  the  incorrupt  body  of  his holy  predecessor,  directing  that  his  own  remains should  be  laid  underneath  it.  This  was  duly done  when  St.  Eadbert  passed  away  on  May  6 of  that  same  year,  698.  St.  Eadbert  was remarkable  for  his  profound  knowledge  of  the Holy  Scriptures  and  for  his  exceeding  charity to  the  poor.

He  became  successively Canon  of  Salisbury  and  Archbishop  of Canterbury,  governing  the  Church  in  England with  gentleness,  but  with  all  Apostolic  vigour. He  corrected  many  abuses  and  bravely  upheld the  rights  of  the  Church  against  the  usurpation of  Henry  III.  and  his  advisers.  Driven  into exile  to  Pontigny  in  France  (where  his  body yet  rests;,  he  died  at  Soissy,  Nov.  16,  A.D.  1242, and  four  years  later  was  canonised  by  Pope Innocent  IV.

He  expired  with  the  name  of  Jesus  on  his  lips and  has  always  been  venerated  as  a  Martyr. His  shrine  at  Bury  St.  Edmunds  was  one  of  the most  frequented  in  England.

Born  in  London  and educated  at  Christ's  Hospital,  he  distinguished himself  at  Oxford,  passing  thence  to  Douai  and eventually  entering  the  Society  of  Jesus. Returning  to  England,  he  preached  with  boldness, and  became  known  as  the  "  Pope's Champion."  After  a  mock  trial  for  treason  and terrible  torturing,  Queen  Elizabeth,  though  not believing  him  guilty,  had  him  hanged  at  Tyburn A.D.  1581.  

EDWARD  (St.)  King,  M.  (March  18)  
(10th  cent.)  The  son  of  Edgar  the  Peaceful and  King  of  England  at  the  age  of  thirteen on  his  father's  death  (A.D.  975).  He  reigned for  only  a  little  over  three  years  and  a  half ; but,  guided  by  St.  Dunstan.  the  great  prelate of  the  time,  won  for  himself  by  his  piety  and virtuous  life,  the  love  and  reverence  of  his subjects.  He  was  murdered  at  Wareham  in Dorsetshire  by  emissaries,  hired  by  his  jealous and  ambitious  stepmother,  March  18,  A.D.  978  ; and  was  forthwith  popularly  acclaimed  as  a Martyr.  His  remains  were  translated  to Shaftesbury  three  years  after  his  death.  

♦EDWARD  POWEL  (Bl.)  M.  (July  30)  
(16th  cent.)  A  learned  Professor  of  Oxford University,  author  of  various  Treatises  in defence  of  the  Faith  against  Luther,  and  one  of the  three  defenders  of  Queen  Catharine  in  the divorce  proceedings.

ELEAZAR 

on  account  of  the  Danish  occupation  of  England. He  was  crowned  King  of  England  on  the restoration  of  the  Anglo-Saxon  line  (A.D.  1042). A  just  ruler  and  in  all  things  considerate  of  the interests  of  his  subjects,  he  yet,  by  the  continuous proofs  of  affection  he  gave  to  the Normans,  who  had  befriended  him  in  his youth,  stirred  up  a  feeling  against  him  among the  high  nobles.  Foremost  among  these  was the  powerful  Earl  Godwin,  whose  daughter, Edith,  he  had  espoused.  But  the  Commoners were  for  "  Good  King  Edward,"  and  for  centuries idolised  his  memory.  His  armies  were successful  in  wars  with  the  Scots  and  Welsh, while  peace  was  maintained  within  his  own dominions.  His  remission  of  the  odious  tax called  the  Dane-Gelt,  and  the  wise  laws  he enacted,  endeared  him  to  his  people,  and  his care  for  the  interests  of  religion  was  of  lasting good  to  them.  He  died  Jan.  5,  A.D.  1060, and  his  body  was  enslirined  in  Westminster Abbey,  built  or  rather  restored  by  him,  where it  yet  remains.  His  festival  is  kept  by  the Church  on  Oct.  13,  the  anniversary  of  the Translation  at  Westminster  of  his  relics.  

♦EDWEN  (St.)  V.  (Nov.  6)  
(7th cent.)  The alleged Patron Saint of 
Llanedwen (Anglesey).  She is described as 
having been a daughter of King Edwin of 
Northumbria.  

♦EDWIN  (St.)  King,  M.  (Oct.  12)  
(7th  cent.)  The  powerful  King  of  Northumbria, who  after  his  marriage  with  St.  Ethelburga, daughter  of  St.  Ethelbert  of  Kent,  embraced the  Christian  religion  preached  to  him  by St.  Paulinus,  his  Queen's  chaplain,  and  zealously promoted  the  conversion  of  his  subjects.  He fell  at  Hatfield  Chase,  A.D.  633,  fighting  against Cadwallon  of  Wales  and  the  Pagan  tyrant  of Mercia,  Penda.  Hence  popular  piety  has numbered  him  among  the  Martyrs  to  Christianity.  

♦EDWOLD  (St.)  (Nov.  27)  
(9th  cent.)  The  brother  of  St.  Edmund  the Martyr,  King  of  East  Anglia.  He  lived  an austere  life  as  a  hermit  at  Cerne  in  Dorsetshire in  the  latter  half  of  the  ninth  century,  and after  his  death  was  venerated  as  a  Saint.  

♦EFFLAM  (St.)  (Nov.  6)  
(6th  cent.)  Son of  a  British Prince who, 
crossing  to  France,  became  Abbot  of  a  monastery 
he  had  founded  in  Brittany. He  died  before 
A.D.  700.  

EGBERT  (St.)  (April  24)  
(8th  cent.)  A  native  of  England  who,  like many  of  his  countrymen  in  the  seventh  century, passed  over  to  Ireland  to  frequent  its  renowned schools  of  piety  and  learning.  He  meditated, consecrating  himself  to  the  A  postdate  of  Germany, but  was  forced  to  be  content  with  being instrumental  in  inducing  SS.  Willibrord, Wigbert  and  others  to  undertake  the  mission. He  himself  repaired  to  St.  Columba's  monastery in  the  Isle  of  Iona,  where  he  lived  a  life  of prayer  and  penance  till  his  death,  a.d.  729, on  the  Festival  of  Easter,  which  he  had  succeeded in  causing  the  Celtic  monks  to  celebrate on  the  day  appointed  by  the  Universal  Church.  

EGDUNUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  12) (4th  cent.)  Victims  of  the  persecution  under Diocletian  at  Nicomedia  in  Asia  Minor  (A.D.  303). Egdunus,  with  seven  other  Christians,  was  hung up  by  his  feet  over  a  lire  and  suffocated  with its  smoke.  

♦EGELNOTH  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  30)  
(11th  cent.) An  Archbishop  of  Canterbury 
who  died  A.D.  1038  and  was  venerated  as  a  Saint.

(9tli  cent.)  One  of  the  Croyland  Abbey Martyrs,  killed  with  his  Abbot  and  many  others by  the  heathen  Danes  (A.D.  870).  

♦EGELWINE  (St.)  (Nov.  29)  
(7th  cent.)  A  prince  of  the  House  of  Wessex, who  lived  a  life  of  great  holiness  in  the  seventh century  at  Athelney  in  Somersetshire. 

♦EGWIN  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  30)  
(8th  cent.)  The  third  Bishop  of  Worcester and  founder  of  the  great  Abbey  of  Evesham, where  at  an  advanced  age  he  ended  his  days, A.D.  717.  Zealous  in  the  interests  of  his  flock and  a  father  to  the  poor,  he  yet  had  to  undergo persecution ;  but  driven  from  his  See  he  was reinstated  with  honour  by  the  Pope  to  whom he  had  made  appeal,  journeying  for  that purpose  to  Borne.  His  tomb  became  illustrious for  the  many  miracles  wrought  at  his  intercession.  

EGYPT  (MARTYRS  OF).  

Egypt  having  its  centre  at  Alexandria,  gave to  the  Catholic  Church,  besides  SS.  Athanasius, Cyril  and  other  illustrious  Doctors*  numerous holy  Anchorites,  known  as  the  Fathers  of  the Desert,  and  a  glorious  array  of  Martyrs,  who suffered  either  in  the  persecutions  under  the Roman  heathen  Emperors,  or  in  defence  of the  Catholic  Faith  against  the  Arian  and  later against  the  Eutychian  heretics,  or  in  the  cause of  religion  after  the  Mohammedan  conquest of  the  country.  Of  Martyrs  not  associated  with the  names  of  any  specially  registered  holy leader,  a  few  groups  are  commemorated  in  the Martyrologies.  

EGYPT  (MARTYRS  OF).  (Jan.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  In  the  great  persecution  under Diocletian,  Upper  Egypt  was  fertile  in  Saints and  Martyrs.  Eusebius,  an  eye-witness,  describes how  the  executioners  themselves  were worn  out  with  their  work.  As  a  rule  after torture,  believers  in  Christ  were  either  beheaded or  burned  alive  (A.D.  303).  

EGYPT  (MARTYRS  OF).  (May  21)  
(4th  cent.)  Numerous  Christians  (among them  many  Bishops  and  Priests),  banished  by the  Arian  Emperor  Constantius  (A.D.  357) when  St.  Athanasius,  having  also  been  sent into  exile,  the  Arian  Archbishop  George  usurped the  See  of  Alexandria.  Of  these  Catholic Confessors  who  took  refuge  in  the  desert,  many, being  old  and  infirm,  died  on  the  journey, others  perished  in  the  wilderness,  leaving  but few  to  return  to  their  homes  on  the  accession of  Julian  (A.D.  361),  whose  aim  it  was  to  recall Christians  of  all  denominations,  in  order  later to  persecute  all  alike.  

♦EIGRAD  (St.)  (Jan.  6)  
(6th  cent.)  A  brother  of  St.  Sampson  of York,  trained  by  St.  llltyd,  and  founder  of  a church  in  Anglesea.  

♦EILAN  (St.)  (Jan.  12)  

Otherwise  St.  ELIAN  or  ALLAN,  which  see.  

♦EINGAN  (ENEON,  ANIANUS)  (St.)  (April  21) (6th  cent.)  A  British  prince  who  came  from Cumberland  into  North  Wales  and  finished  his days  in  religious  retirement  at  Llanengan  near Bangor.  He  died  about  A.D.  590.  He  appears to  have  been  one  of  the  sons  of  the  famous chieftain  Cunedda,  whose  family  is  said  to  have produced  no  less  than  fifty  Saints.  

♦EL^ETH  THE  KING  (St.)  (Nov.  10)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Briton  from  the  North  driven 
into  Wales  by  the  Picts.  He  became  a  monk 
under  St.  Sciriol  in  Anglesea.  Some  poems  of 
his  are  still  extant.

ELEAZAR  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  1)  

One  of  the  MACHABEES,  which  see.  

ELEAZAR  (St.)  (Sept.  27)  
(14th  cent.)  A  nobleman  of  the  Diocese  of Avignon,  Count  of  Ariano  in  the  Kingdom  of Naples,  and  married  to  Delphina,  who  like  him is  honoured  as  a  Saint.  lie  was  distinguished, in  the  trying  and  difficult  circumstances  of  the turbulent  age  in  which  he  lived,  lor  his  scrupulous obsi  rvance  of  God's  Law,  ;i^  well  as  for  his practice  of  constant  penance  and  prayer.  To advance  themselves  yet  more  in  the  way  of perfection, he and his wife became fervent

ELERIUS 
Tertiaries  of  St.  Francis,  tending  the  poor  and especially  the  lepers.  He  was  engaged  at Paris  as  Ambassador  from  the  King  of  Naples to  the  French  monarch,  when  death  overtook him  (a.d.  1325)  at  the  age  of  forty.  Together with  St.  Delphina  he  was  buried  at  Apt  in Provence.  Urban  V.  canonised  St.  Eleazar  in 1369. *ELERIUS  (St.)  (Nov.  3)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Saint  who  lived  in  the sixth  century,  and  who  is  mentioned  in  the traditions  concerning  St.  Winifred.  He  is supposed  to  have  presided  over  a  monastery in  North  Wales. ELESBAAN  (St.)  King.  (Oct.  27)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Christian  King  of  Ethiopia (Abyssinia)  in  the  first  half  of  the  sixth  century, who  distinguished  himself  by  his  warlike  and successful  expeditions  in  Arabia,  where  a Jewish  usurper  had  almost  exterminated  the Christianity  of  the  Southern  part  of  the  Peninsula. In  these  wars  he  was  supported  by  the Byzantine  Emperors,  Justin  I.  and  Justinian. At  the  close  of  a  long  and  memorable  reign  St. Elesbaan  abdicated  and  ended  his  life  as  a  hermit in  the  exercises  of  prayer  and  penance.  He died  about  a.d.  555.  His  real  name  seems  to have  been  Caleb.  Hence,  the  Abyssinians style  him  Calam-Negus. *ELESMES  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  30)  

Otherwise  St.  ADELELMUS,  which  see. *ELETH  (St.)  (Nov.  10)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Llaneleth in  Anglesea.  He  was  of  the  Cunedda  family, brother  of  SS.  Seriol  and  Meirion.  He  was surnamed  "  Frenluuin  "  (the  King),  and  lived in  the  sixth  century.  Two  hymns  of  his  composition are  extant. ELEUCHADIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  14)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  learned  man  of  Greek  origin who  was  converted  and  ordained  deacon  by St.  Apollinaris,  and  who  governed  the  Church of  Ravenna,  together  with  other  deacons  and priests,  during  that  Saint's  four  years'  absence. Elected  a.d.  100,  on  account  of  the  miraculous apparition  of  a  dove  resting  over  his  head,  to succeed  St.  Aderitus,  who  had  followed  St. Apollinaris,  he  was  for  twelve  years  Bishop  of Ravenna.  He  died  Feb.  14,  A.D.  112,  and  was at  once  honoured  as  a  Saint.  His  relics  were subsequently  translated  to  Pa  via  in  Lornbardy. ELEUSIPPUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  17)  

See  SS.  SPEUSIPPUS,  ELEUSIPPUS,  &c. ELEUTHERIUS  of  TOURNAI  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  20)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Tournai,  chosen Bishop  of  that  city  (A.D.  486)  ten  years  before the  conversion  of  King  Clovis  and  his  Franks. His  great  work  was  the  evangelising  those  of that  nation  who  had  settled  in  and  near  Tournai. In  this  he  was  successful,  as  also  in  battling with  Arianism  at  that  time  rife  in  the  West  of Europe.  But  his  zeal  led  to  his  being  persecuted and  in  the  end  his  enemies  attacked  and  murdered him  at  his  church  door,  a.d.  532.  Some of  his  writings  are  still  extant. ELEUTHERIUS  of  CONSTANTINOPLE  (St.)  

Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  20)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Saint,  concerning  whose identity  there  is  much  dispute.  The  Bollandists believe  him  one  and  the  same  with  the  Byzantine Martyr  Eleutherius,  commemorated  with  others on  Aug.  4.  Others  will  have  him  to  have  been the  fifth  or  perhaps  the  eighth  Bishop  of  Byzantium, and  to  have  flourished  and  suffered  martyrdom in  the  third  century. ELEUTHERIUS  and  ANTHIA  (SS.)  MM.  (April  18)  
(2nd  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Rome  under  Hadrian (A.D.  117-138).  St.  Eleutherius,  son  of  Eugeuius the  Consul,  a  cleric,  had  been  consecrated  by the  then  Pope  as  Bishop  of  Illyricum  ;  but while  preparing  to  repair  to  his  field  of  work  he was  arrested  as  a  Christian,  together  with St.  Anthia,  his  mother.  They  were  put  to  the torture and beheaded.  Part of their relics 
90 

were  afterwards  transported  to  Constantinople, where  a  church  was  built  in  their  honour.  

ELEUTHERIUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (May  26)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  successor  in  St.  Peter's Chair  of  Pope  St.  Soter,  whose  deacon  he  had been.  During  his  Pontificate,  the  Fourth General  Persecution,  that  under  Marcus  Aurelius, took  place,  raging  chiefly  in  Gaul,  though  there were  Martyrs  also  in  Rome.  St.  Eleutherius had  likewise  to  deal  with  the  Montanist  heretics whom  he  exposed  and  condemned,  and  with some  forms  of  Gnosticism  then  rife  even  in Rome.  A  remarkable  event  of  the  Pontificate of  St.  Eleutherius  (variously  dated  A.d.  170-185, or  182-193)  was  his  sending  missionaries  to  the Pagans  of  Britain,  for  the  trustworthiness  of  the tradition  concerning  which  there  is  very  satisfying evidence.  The  circumstances  of  the death  of  St  Eleutherius  are  not  known.  

ELEUTHERIUS  (St.)  (May  29)  
(12th  cent.)  He  is  said  to  have  been  a brother  of  SS.  Grimwald  and  Fulk,  and  to  have been  born  in  England.  He  died,  whilst  on  a pilgrimage,  at  Rocca  d'Arce,  near  Aquino  in the  Kingdom  of  Naples.  He  is  usually  set down  as  a  Saint  of  the  twelfth  century,  but  there is  great  uncertainty  both  as  to  his  date  and  to the  particulars  of  his  life.  

ELEUTHERIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  4)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Senator  and  Chamberlain  to the  Emperor  Maximian  Galerius  at  Constantinople. On  becoming  a  Christian  he  left  the Court  and  retired  to  a  country  estate  he  owned in  Bithynia.  There  he  was  arrested,  tortured and  beheaded  (before  A.D.  310).  His  body  was buried  near  the  place  of  his  martyrdom,  and  a church  afterwards  erected  there.  {See  the notice  of  St.  Eleutherius  of  Constantinople, Feb.  20).  

ELEUTHERIUS  and  LEONIDAS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.8) (Date  unknown.) Martyrs  at  Constantinople, where  they  were  burned  to  death  for  the  Faith, but  in  which  of  the  early  persecutions  is  uncertain.  

ELEUTHERIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  16)  
(6th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Droctoald in  the  See  of  Auxerre  (a.d.  532).  His  Episcopate lasted  for  twenty-eight  years,  during  which  he assisted  at  the  four  Councils  of  Orleans.  Nothing further  is  now  known  concerning  him.  

ELEUTHERIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  6)  
(6th  cent.)  The  head  of  a  monastery  near Spoleto  (Central  Italy)  in  the  time  of  Pope St.  Gregory  the  Great,  who  personally  experienced the  efficacy  of  his  prayers  and  supernatural gifts.  St.  Eleutherius  died  in  the monastery  of  St.  Andrew  (now  San  Gregorio), Rome,  about  a.d.  585,  and  his  relics  were  later translated  to  Spoleto.  

ELEUTHERIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  2) (4th  cent.)  A  group  of  Christians,  to  be counted  by  hundreds,  who  falsely  accused  of having  set  fire  to  Diocletian's  palace  at  Nicomedia,  were  savagely  tortured  and  put  to  death in  that  city  (a.d.  303,  as  is  commonly  believed). But  there  were  two  great  fires  in  the  same  pile of  buildings,  with  an  interval  of  two  years between  them,  which  makes  the  precise  date of  the  martyrdom  uncertain.  Nor  is  it  clear how  far  the  company  who  suffered  with  the Bishop  St.  Anthimus  (April  27)  are  to  be distinguished  from  the  fellow-sufferers  with St.  Eleutherius.  Again,  this  St.  Eleutherius is  by  some  thought  to  be  identical  with  the Martyr  of  the  same  name  who  is  honoured  on Aug.  4,  and  may  possibly  be  also  the  BishopMartyr  of  Feb.  20.  The  whole  history  is  very hard  to  unravel.

See  SS.  DIONYSIUS,  ELEUTHERIUS,  &c 
♦ELEVATHA  (St.)  V.M.  (Aug.  1)  

Otherwise  St.  ALMEDHA,  which  see.  

♦ELFLEDA  (EDILFREDA,  ETHELFREDA)  
(St.)  (Feb.  14)  
(8th cent.)  A Saxon princess consecrated 
ELISABETH 

to  God  from  her  infancy  by  her  father  Oswy of  Northumbria.  She  was  by  him  committed to  the  care  of  St.  Hilda  at  Whitby,  whom  she eventually  succeeded  as  Abbess.  St.  Elfleda died  a.d.  713.  

♦ELFLEDA  (St.)  Widow.  (Oct.  23)  
(10th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  princess  who lived  as  a  Recluse  at  Glastonbury,  held  in  great veneration  by  St.  Dunstan,  to  whom  she  foretold the  year  and  day  of  her  own  death.  This  took place  about  the  middle  of  the  tenth  century. This  holy  widow  must  not  be  confused  with  her contemporary  and  namesake  the  Abbess  of Romsey,  though  their  festivals  were  kept  on the  same  dav.  

♦ELFLEDA  (ETHELFLEDA)  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  23)  
(10th  cent.) One  of  the  nuns  of  St.  Modwenna 
at  Romsey,  to  the  government  of  which  Abbey 
she eventually succeeded.  She lived in the 
first  half  of  the  tenth  century.

Otherwise  St.  ALFRIC,  which  see.  

♦ELGAR  (St.)  (June  14)  
(11th  cent.)  Born  in  Devonshire,  after  some years  of  captivity  in  Ireland,  he  settled  in  the Isle  of  Bardsey  off  the  coast  of  Carnarvon, where  he  lived  as  a  hermit  until  his  holy  death towards  the  year  1100.  

♦ELGIVA  (St.)  Queen,  Widow.  (May  18)  
(10th  cent.)  The  mother  of  Kings  Edwy  and Edgar,  and  wife  of  King  Edmund,  the  brother of  Athelstan.  On  the  death  of  her  husband she  retired  to  King  Alfred's  monastery  at Shaftesbury,  and  there  closed  (a.d.  971)  a  life wholly  spent  in  the  discharge  of  her  duties  as wife  and  mother,  and  in  works  of  piety  and charity.  

♦ELIAN  (EILAN,  ALLAN)  (St.)  (Jan.  12)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Cornish  or  Breton  Saint  of the  princely  family  to  which  belonged  SS. Ismael,  Oudoceus,  Melorius,  Tugdual,  Judictel, and  other  holy  men.  He  has  given  his  name to  Llanelian  in  Anglesea,  and  was  Titular  of St.  Allan's  Church  in  Powder.  He  may  have followed  his  friend  St.  Cybi  into  Cornwall. Baring-Gould  calls  attention  to  the  not  infrequent confusing  of  his  name  with  that  of  St. Hilary.  

♦ELIAN  AP  ERBIN  (St.)  (Jan.  12)  
(5th  cent.)  The  name  of  this  holy  man appears  in  some  Welsh  Calendars,  and  on  that account  is  given  in  the  English  Menology. He  is  possibly  identical  with  the  St.  Eloan, son  of  St.  Erbin,  Prince  of  Devon,  a  fifth  century Saint,  whose  Feast  is  also  kept  on  Jan.  12. He  would  therefore  be  other  than  the  St.  Elian or  Allan,  styled  "  the  pilgrim,"  who  lived perhaps  a  half  century  later.  

ELIAS,  JEREMIAS,  ISAIAS,  SAMUEL  and DANIEL  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  Five  brothers,  who  on  their return  from  visiting  some  of  their  fellowChristians  condemned  to  toil  in  the  mines  of Cilicia,  were  arrested  at  the  gates  of  Cpesarea in  Palestine,  and  after  being  put  to  the  torture, beheaded  (a.d.  309)  under  Galerius  Maximianus and  Maximin  Daza.  

ELIAS,  PAUL  and  ISIDORE  (SS.)  MM.  (April  17) (9th  cent.)  St.  Elias  was  a  priest  venerable for  age  and  virtue,  who  together  with  Paul  and Isidore,  two  young  Christians,  his  spiritual children,  suffered  for  Christ  (A.D.  856)  at  Cordova in  Spain  in  the  persecution  under  the  Caliph Mohammed.  St.  Eulogius  makes  special  mention of  them  in  his  History  of  the  Times.  

ELIAS  of  JERUSALEM  (St.)  Bp.  (July  4)  

See  SS.  FLAVIAN  and  ELIAS.  

ELIAS  (ELIJAH)  (St.)  Prophet.  (July  20)  
(8th  cent.  B.C.)  The  great  Prophet  raised  up in  the  Kingdom  of  Israel  to  reprove  the  Ten Fallen  Tribes,  and  whose  works  are  set  forth in  the  Third  and  Fourth  r.ook  of  Kings.  The tradition  is  that,  carried  away  from  this  world 

in  a  chariot  of  fire  (4  Kings,  ii.),  he  has  to reappear  upon  earth,  and  to  die  for  Christ  at the  end  of  time  (Apoc.  xi.).  The  Carmelite Order,  tracing  its  origin  to  the  "  sons  of  the prophets  "  (4  Kings,  i.  13),  venerates  St.  Elias as  its  founder.  His  Festival  is  kept  annually in  many  churches,  especially  in  the  East. ELIAS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.  19)  

See  SS.  PELEUS,  NILUS, &c.
♦ELIER  (St.)  (July  16)  

Otherwise  St.  HELIER,  which  see. ELIGIUS  (ELOY)  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  1)  
(7th  cent.)  Born  near  Limoges  (a.d.  588), he  was  a  man  of  remarkable  piety  and  ability. By  his  skill  in  the  art  of  working  in  precious metals — he  is  the  Patron  Saint  of  metal-workers — he  acquired  a  place  and  influence  at  the Courts  of  Clotaire  II.  and  Dagobert  I.,  Kings of  the  Franks.  His  prospects  of  advancement he  relinquished  in  a.d.  640,  in  order  to  become a  priest,  distributing  the  wealth  which  he  had acquired  to  the  poor.  Consecrated  Bishop  of Noyon,  he  evangelised  a  great  part  of  Flanders, and  more  particularly  the  districts  round Antwerp,  Ghent  and  Courtray.  His  death probably  took  place  A.D.  658  or  659  ;  but  by some  authors  it  is  post-dated  to  a.d.  665. *ELINED  (St.)  V.M.  (Aug.  1)  

Otherwise  St.  ALMEDHA,  which  see.  

The  name  is  also  written  ELLYW,  and  the Saint is probably the one ivhose memory is perpetuated  in  the  Welsh  place-name  Llanelly. ELIPHIUS  (ELOFF)  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian,  some  say  by  birth an  Irishman  or  a  Scot,  who  suffered  at  Toul  in France  under  Julian  the  Apostate  (a.d.  362). His  relics  were  translated  in  the  tenth  century to  Cologne. ELISABETH  of  SCHONAUGE  (St.)  V. (June  18)  
(12th  cent.)  A  Benedictine  nun  of  the  Abbey of  Schonauge,  near  Bingen  on  the  Rhine,  of which  monastery  she  was  for  many  years  Abbess. Her  sufferings  from  ill-health  were  lifelong, but  borne  with  marvellous  cheerfulness. The  friend  of  St.  Hildegarde,  she,  like  that  great contemplative,  was  favoured  with  heavenly visions,  and  wrote  valuable  books  on  Mystical Theology.  She  died  a.d.  1165  at  the  age  of thirty-six.  Her  name  was  inserted  in  the Roman  Martyrology,  though  she  does  not appear  ever  to  have  been  formally  canonised. ELISABETH,  QUEEN  OF  PORTUGAL  (St.)  

Widow.  (July  8)  
(14th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  Peter  II., King  of  Aragon,  born  in  1271.  Educated  with great  care  from  her  earliest  years,  she  gave constant  proofs  of  her  spirit  of  self-denial  and prayer.  At  the  age  of  twelve  she  was  married to  Dionysius,  King  of  Portugal,  becoming  for the  King  and  Court  a  striking  pattern  of  every virtue.  Her  charity  to  the  poor  and  her continuous  endeavours  to  prevent  hostilities breaking  out  between  her  relatives  the  Kings of  Portugal  and  Castile,  were  characteristic of  her  sanctity.  After  the  death  of  her  husband (A.D.  1325)  she  took  the  habit  of  the  Third Order  of  St.  Francis,  and  devoted  herself  to good  works.  She  died  at  Estremos  (A.D.  1336), and  was  canonised  (A.D.  1625)  by  Pope  Urban VIII. ELISABETH  (St.)  Widow.  (Nov.  5)  

The  mother  o>f  St.  John  the  Baptist.  There are  legends  and  traditions  extant  concerning her ;  but  our  knowledge  is  really  limited  to what  we  gather  from  the  first  chapter  of  St. Luke's  Gospel.  In  their  commentaries  upon this  Gospel,  however,  the  Holy  Fathers  often dwell  at  length  upon  the  sanctity  of  her  life. ELISABETH  of  HUNGARY  (St.)  Widow.  (Nov.  19)  
(13th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  Alexander  II., King  of  Hungary,  born  A.D.  1207,  and  when  only four  years  of  age,  promised  in  marriage  to Louis,  son  of  the  Landgrave  of  Thuringia. She  was  educated  at  the  Thuringian  Court, where  she  suffered  much  from  the  jealousy  of  her

future  relatives.  Louis,  however,  to  whom  she was  married  in  1221 ,  proved  himself  a  husband worthy  of  her.  With  his  permission,  and  to his  secret  delight,  she  multiplied  her  works  of mercy  ;  for  her  love  of  the  poor  was  boundless. Even  in  her  dress  she  sought  to  be  like  them. On  her  husband's  death  at  Otranto  in  1227, while  on  his  way  with  the  Emperor  Frederick Barbarossa  to  take  part  in  the  defence  of  the Holy  Land,  she  with  her  children  was  stripped of  everything  and  reduced  to  the  direst  straits by  an  opposing  faction,  headed  by  her  brotherin-law.  Befriended  at  length,  and  having  seen her  son  Herman  reinstated  in  his  inheritance, she  took  the  habit  of  the  Third  Order  of  St. Francis  (of  which  she  is  the  Patron  Saint), and  remaining  in  the  world,  busied  herself  to the  day  of  her  death  (Nov.  19,  1231)  in  works of  charity  and  piety.  Her  relics  are  enshrined at  Marpurg,  the  place  of  her  decease,  in  Thuringia.  She  was  canonised  only  four  years  after her  death  by  Pope  Gregory  IX.  

ELISEUS  (ELISHA)  (St.)  Prophet.  (June  14)  
(8th  cent.  B.C.)  The  holy  man  on  whom  fell the  mantle  of  Elias,  and  who  continued  the  work of  that  great  Prophet,  as  is  described  in  the Fourth  Book  of  Kings.  In  the  age  of  St. Jerome,  his  grave  in  Samaria  was  shown  as containing  also  the  body  of  St.  Abdias  the Prophet.  The  Feast  of  St.  Eliseus  is  kept by  the  Carmelite  Order  and  also  generally  in the  East.  

♦ELLIDIUS  (ILLOD)  (St.)  (Aug.  8)  
(7th  cent.)  Patron  Saint,  as  would  appear, 
of  Hirnant  (Montgomery),  and  of  a  church  in 
the Scilly Islands.  The name "  St. Helen's 
Isle  "  is  a  corrupt  variant  of  St.  Ellidius's  Isle.

♦ELPHAGE  (ALPHAGE)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  12) (10th  cent.)  Called  the  Elder  to  distinguish him  from  his  more  famous  namesake,  the Martyr  of  Canterbury  and  Greenwich.  St. Elphege  the  Elder,  a  monk  of  singularly  holy life,  succeeded  St.  Birstan  in  the  See  of  Winchester, where  he  died,  and  his  relics  were enshrined  (a.d.  951).  

ELPHEGE  (ALPHAGE)  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  19) (11th  cent.)  Born  A.D.  954,  of  a  noble  Saxon family,  he  became  a  monk,  and  afterwards Abbot  of  the  monastery  he  had  founded  near Bath.  In  the  year  984  he  was  chosen  Bishop of  Winchester,  and  in  1000  Archbishop  of Canterbury.  The  following  year  the  Danes sacked  Canterbury,  carrying  off  the  holy Archbishop,  for  whom  they  expected  a  large ransom  ;  but  he  refused  to  allow  his  Church to  put  itself  to  such  expense  for  him.  He  was therefore  kept  in  prison  at  Greenwich  for  seven months,  and,  because  he  still  refused  to  charge his  Church  with  his  ransom,  was  stoned  and finally  done  to  death  by  a  swordstroke  (A.D. 1002).  He  fell  asleep  in  Christ,  truly  a Martyr,  with  his  last  breath  praying  for  his murderers.

he  passed  away  (a.d.  422),  and  was  buried in 
92 

the  church  of  St.  Justus  in  his  Episcopal  city, 
and  honoured  as  a  Saint.  The  particulars  of 
his  life  are  lost.  

ELPIDIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  2)  
(4th cent.)  A hermit in Cappadoeia who 
in the fourth century lived for twenty-five 
years  in  a  cave  on  a  mountain  side,  and  gathered 
round  him  numerous  disciples.  His  relics  were 
brought  to  a  village  in  the  Marches  of  Ancona 
(Central  Italy),  now  called  Sant'  Elpidio,  where 
they  attract  many  pilgrims.  A  late  tradition 
avers  that  he  preached  and  died  in  that  very 
place,  indicating,  it  is  likely,  some  confusion 
between  two  Saints  of  the  same  name.  

ELPIDIUS,  MARCELLUS,  EUSTOCHIUS  and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  10)  
(4th cent.)  Elpidius, a dignitary at the 
Court  of  the  Emperor  Constantius, degraded 
by Julian the Apostate, having generously 
confessed the Faith in the presence of the 
latter,  is  said  to  have  been,  with  his  companions,

(2nd cent.)  The two Britons alleged by 
tradition  to  have  been  sent  by  King  St.  Lucius 
to  Pope  St.  Eleutherius  to  beg  for  missionaries 
to  Britain,  as  a  result  of  which  petition  SS.  

Fugatius  and  Damian  came  to  South  Wales.  

St.  Elvan  is  alleged  to  have  become  a  Bishop  ;

(Gth  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  one  of  the 
holy  men  who  accompanied  St.  Breaca  from 
Ireland  to  Cornwall,  and  perhaps  the  title  Saint 
of St. Allen's Church in that county.  But

EMERIC  (St.)  (Nov.  4)  
(11th  cent.)  The  son  of  St.  Stephen,  the first  Christian  King  of  Hungary.  He  was remarkable  for  his  piety  and  for  his  austere virtue,  and  was  favoured  by  Almighty  God with  many  supernatural  gifts.  He  died  still a  youth  (A.D.  1031),  and  the  many  miracles which  took  place  at  his  tomb,  together  with the  insistency  of  the  Hungarian  people,  led  to his  canonisation  (A.D.  1083).

(7th  cent.)  A  native  of  Poitiers  in  France, where  he  was  raised  to  the  Episcopate  on account  of  his  learning  and  holiness  of  life. In  the  year  648  he  set  out  to  preach  Christianity in  Germany,  and  fixed  his  See  at  Ratisbon  in Bavaria,  induced  thereto  by  King  Sigebert  III. In  653,  while  on  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome,  he  was set  upon  at  a  place  called  Helffendorff  by  the emissaries  of  Lauthbert,  a  young  noble  of dissolute  life,  and  put  to  death.  The  shrine  of St.  Emmeramus  is  at  Ratisbon. EMYGDIUS  (EMIDIUS)  (St.)  Bp.,  M. (Aug.  5)  
(4th  cent.)

(4th  cent.) A  Christian  maiden  of  Saragossa in  Spain,  one  of  the  numerous  victims  of  the  fury of  the  persecution  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  306). *ENDEUS  (EDNA,  ENNA)  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  21)  
(6th  cent.)  The  brother  of  St.  Fanchea  and founder  of  many  monasteries  of  which  the principal  one  was  at  Killeany  in  the  Arran Islands  (Ireland).  St.  Endeus  counted  SS. Kyran  of  Clonmacnoise  and  Brendan  among his  disciples.  He  died  early  in  the  sixth centurv. ENGELBERT  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  7)  
(13th  cent.)  A  German  of  noble  birth  who (a.d.  1215)  succeeded  a  troublesome  and  unworthy Bishop  in  the  important  See  of  Cologne, in  which  he  soon  re-established  peace  and  good order,  while  himself  becoming  conspicuous  on account  of  his  wise  and  considerate  administration and  of  his  virtuous  life.  The  Emperor Frederick  II  made  him  tutor  of  the  prince  his son  ;  also  for  a  time  his  chief  minister  for  the government  of  the  Imperial  dominions  north of  the  Alps.  Many  were  the  abuses  and injustices  he  corrected.  An  evildoer  forced  by the  Saint  to  restore  certain  ill-gotten  goods, plotted  his  death,  and  while  travelling  in  his company  bad  him  murdered  by  hired  assassins (Nov.  7,  1225).  Numerous  miracles  wrought  at liis  tomb  speedily  attested  the  sanctity  of St.  Engelbert.
♦ENGELMUND  (St.)  (June  21)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  Saint,  fellowmissionary with St. Willibrord in Holland, where  he  died  late  in  the  eighth  century.  His relics  arc  enshrined  at  Utrecht. *ENGELMUND  (St.)  (June  21)

♦ENGHENEDL.  (Sept.  30)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Saint,  to  whom  a  church in Anglesey is dedicated.  Nothing is now known  about  his  life.
♦ENGLACIUS  (ENGLAT)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  3)  
(10th  cent.)  a.d.  966  is  given  as  the  date  of the  death  of  this  Scottish  Saint,  who  by  some is  said  to  have  been  a  Bishop.  He  lived  at Tarves  in  Aberdeenshire,  where  he  is  known as  St.  Tanglan.
♦ENGLAND  (MARTYRS  OF)  (BI.)  (May  4)  
(16th  cent.)  By  these  are  meant  not  all  who in  various  ages  have  laid  down  their  lives  for Christ  in  England,  but  only  the  holy  men  and women  put  to  death  for  professing  the  Catholic Religion,  the  Faith  of  their  Fathers,  in  the persecution  consequent  on  the  so-called  Reformation between  the  years  1535  and  1681.  They 

are  about  six  hundred  in  number.  Of  these, fifty-four  were  beatified  bv  Pope  Leo  XIII  on Dec.  9,  1886,  and  nine  others  on  May  15,  1895. It  is  a  festival  in  their  honour  which  is  in England  kept  annually  on  May  4,  and  a  brief notice  of  each  one  will  be  found  in  the  present volume.  Prominent  among  them  are  Blessed John  Fisher,  Bishop  of  Rochester,  Blessed Thomas  More,  the  Martyrs  of  the  London Charterhouse,  &c.  The  cases  of  253  others  of these  Servants  of  God  are  now  being  officially enquired  into  in  Rome,  and  pending  the  investigation they  are  styled  "  Venerable,"  a  prima facie  case  having  been  already  made  out.  It  is proved  that  they  all  suffered  death  at  the hands  of  the  public  executioner,  after  having been  in  the  majority  of  cases  put  to  the  torture. But  in  not  a  few  instances,  proofs  have  still to  be  brought  that  they  suffered  on  account  of their  religion,  and  not  merely  on  charges,  true or  false,  of  treason  or  other  crimes.  There still  remain  284  sufferers  of  whose  claim  to  be regarded  as  Martyrs  the  Church  has  not  as  yet taken  cognisance.  

♦ENGLAT  (TANGLEN)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  3)  
(10th  cent.)  A  Saint  with  an  Office  in  the Aberdeen  Breviary.  He  may  have  been  a Bishop,  but  the  particulars  of  his  life  have not  been  preserved.  He  died  at  Tarves, Aberdeen,  probably  about  a.d.  966.

ENNECO  (INIGO)  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  1)  
(11th  cent.)  The  second  Abbot  of  Onia, a  Spanish  monastery  founded  by  King  Sancho the  Great  of  Navarre  and  transferred  to  Benedictine monks  of  the  Cluniac  Observance. St.  Inigo  governed  this  Abbey  from  A.D.  1038 to  a.d.  1057,  in  which  year  he  passed  away, famous  for  sanctity  and  austerity  of  life,  and also  for  numerous  miracles.  

ENNODIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  17)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  in  Cisalpine  Gaul  (Northern Italy),  or  perhaps  at  Aries  (a.d.  473),  and  well versed  in  Rhetoric  and  in  the  science  of  his time,  he  married  a  rich  and  noble  lady.  But after  recovering  from  a  dangerous  illness,  he consecrated  himself  to  God  (taking  deacon's orders),  and  his  wife  retired  into  a  convent. Consecrated  Bishop  of  Pavia  (Lombardy) A.D.  510,  he  was  twice  sent  by  Pope  Hormisdas as  his  Legate  to  the  Eastern  Emperor  Anastasius,  to  try  to  induce  the  latter  to  cease from  favouring  Eutychianism  (the  heresy  of those  who  denied  to  Christ  a  real  human nature  like  our  own).  On  the  last  occasion  he endured  much  ill-treatment  at  Constantinople, and  barely  escaped  thence  with  his  life.  Returning to  Pavia  he  laboured  with  much  zeal  for  the temporal  and  spiritual  welfare  of  his  flock. He  died  four  years  later  (A.D.  521).  The  poems and  ascetical  tracts  of  St.  Ennodius  are  interesting, though  as  literature  they  suffer  greatly from  the  defective  taste  of  the  age  in  which  he lived.  

♦ENOCH  (St.)  V.  (March  25)  

Otherwise  St.  KENNOCHA,  which  see.  

♦ENODER  (CYNIDR)  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  27)  
(6th  cent.)  A  grandson  of  the  Welsh  chieftain Brychan  of  Brecknock.  Llanginydr  in  Herefordshire perpetuates  his  memory,  as  also  possibly St.  Enoder  or  Enodoc  in  Cornwall.  He  is the  Breton  St.  Quidic.  His  contemporary  in the  sixth  century,  St.  Wenedoc  or  Enodoc, can  with  difficulty  be  discriminated  from  him.  

♦ENODOCH  (WENEDOC)  (St.)  V.  (March  7)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Spirit  of  the  great Brychan  race,  possibly  identical  with  St. Gwendydd,  daughter  of  the  famous  chieftain Brychan  of  Brecknock.  She  cannot  have flourished  later  than  A.D.  520.

(8th  cent.)  A  fellow-labourer  in  Germany with  St.  Boniface  and  a  sharer  in  his  martyrdom (A.d.  754).  He  is  claimed  as  of  Irish  descent. and  is  also  asserted  to  have  been  consecrated Assistant  Bishop  of  Utrecht,  where  his  remains were  venerated  until  enshrined  at  Erfurth,  the scene  of  many  miracles  worked  by  his  intercession 
♦EOCHOD  (St.)  (Jan.  25)  
(7th  cent.)  One  of  St.  Columbkille's  twelve companions,  and  chosen  by  him  to  Christianise the  people  of  North  Britain.  He  is  called  the Apostle  of  the  Picts  of  Galloway.  He  appears to  have  survived  St.  Columba,  who  died  a.d. 597.

EPAPHRAS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (July  19)  
(1st  cent.)  "  The  most  beloved  fellowservant  "  of  St.  Paul  (Col.  i.  7).  He  is  traditionally said  to  have  been  Bishop  of  Colosse  and  to have  suffered  there  for  Christ.  But  beyond what  we  read  of  him  in  Scripture  (Coloss.  i.  7  ; iv.  12 ;  Philem.  23)  we  know  nothing  of  his life.  

EPAPHRODITUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  22)  
(First  cent.)  The  name  occurs  (Phil.  ii.  25) as  that  of  an  Apostle  sent  to  the  Philippians by  St.  Paul.  Hence,  St.  Epaphroditus  is reputed  first  Bishop  of  Philippi  (Macedonia). Again,  we  have  Epaphroditus,  first  Bishop  of Andriacia  (Lycia),  and  lastly  Epaphroditus, sent  as  its  first  Bishop  to  Terracina  in  the  south of  Italy.  All  are  of  the  Apostolic  Age,  and  all are  said  to  have  been  of  the  seventy-two disciples  chosen  by  Christ  (Luke  x.  1).  There are  no  data  for  elucidating  the  problems involved.  

EPARCHIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  23)  

See  SS.  DOMITIUS,  PELAGIA,  &c.  

EPARCHIUS  (CYBAR)  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  1)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  in  Perigord  (France) a.d.  504,  and  heir  to  the  Dukedom  of  that Province.  He  preferred,  however,  to  become a  monk  at  Sessac.  Later,  desirous  of  a  still more  retired  and  more  austere  life,  he  came  to Angouleme  (a.d.  542),  and  with  the  help  of St.  Aphtonius,  Bishop  of  the  city,  was  solemnly enclosed  in  a  cavern  close  by.  He  had  already received  the  priesthood,  and  his  sanctity  and the  numerous  miracles  he  wrought  drew  great crowds  to  listen  to  his  preaching.  From  his retreat  he  also  directed  certain  monks,  who eventually  founded  a  monastery  in  the  neighbourhood. He  died  a.d.  581,  and  was  chosen to  be  the  Patron  Saint  of  the  Diocese  of  Angouleme. His  relics,  reverenced  for  a  thousand years,  were  destroyed  by  the  Huguenots  in  the sixteenth  century.  

EPHEBUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  14)  

See  SS.  PROCULUS,  EPHEBUS, &c.  

EPHESUS  (MARTYRS  OF).  (Jan.  12)  
(8th  cent.)  Forty-two  monks  of  blameless lives,  zealous  opponents  of  the  Iconoclasts,  on which  account  their  monastery  at  Ephesus  was burned  down,  and  they  themselves  put  to torture  and  death  by  the  persecuting  Emperor Constantine  Copronymus,  about  A.D.  762.  

EPHRvEM  THE  SYRIAN  (St.)  (Feb.  1)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Father  of  the  Church,  a  great orator  and  a  true  poet,  who  has  left  us  a  considerable body  of  writings  of  which  his  Exposition of  the  Scriptures  is  the  most  notable. Born  in  Mesopotamia  of  Christian  parents, he  became  a  monk  while  still  young,  and appears  to  have  been  present  at  the  Council of  Nicsea  (a.d.  325)  as  deacon  or  attendant upon  one  of  the  Bishops.  The  chief  scene  of his  labours  was  Edessa  (Orfa),  where  he  taught in  the  schools  and  became  famous  for  his  skill 94 

and  success  in  controversy.  The  last  years  of his  life  he  passed  in  solitude,  dying  at  an advanced  age,  a.d.  378.  

EPHREM  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (March  4)  

See  SS.  BASILIUS,  EUGENIUS, &c.  

EPHYSIUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Palestinian  who,  coming  to Borne,  gained  the  favour  of  the  Emperor Diocletian,  and  was  by  him  made  Governor  of the  Island  of  Sardinia,  where  he  was  converted to  Christianity,  and  in  consequence  degraded from  his  office,  tortured  and  beheaded  about A.D.  303.  

EPICHARIS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  27)  
(4th  cent.)  A  holy  Christian  woman,  martyred at  Borne,  or,  as  some  say,  at  Constantinople, in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian  at the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century.  

EPICTETUS,  JUCUNDUS,  SECUNDUS,  VITALIS, FELIX  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  9)  
(3rd  cent.)  Twelve  African  Martyrs,  probably of  the  Decian  persecution  (a.d.  250).  One of  the  Epistles  of  St.  Cyprian  is  addressed  to  a Bishop  Epictetus,  conjectured  to  be  the  Epictetus  commemorated  on  this  day.  

EPICTETUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  

See  SS.  MABTIAL,  SATURNINUS, &c.  

EPIGMENIUS  (St.)  M.  (March  24)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  mentioned  as  having baptised  St.  Crescentius,  a  child-martyr  of  the persecution  under  Diocletian.  It  is  nowhere stated  that  he  himself  perished  by  the  sword. Hence,  probably  he  is  really  to  be  numbered only  among  Confessors.  

EPIMACHUS  (St.)  M.  (May  10)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Alexandria  in Egypt,  burned  there  at  the  stake  in  the  Decian persecution  (A.d.  250),  and  commemorated  by the  Church  together  with  St.  Gordian  on May  10,  and  likewise  with  St.  Alexander,  his fellow-sufferer,  on  Dec.  12.  

EPIPHANA  (St.)  M.  (July  12)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Mentioned  in  the  very untrustworthy  Acts  of  St.  Alphius  and  his fellow-sufferers,  and  consequently  dated  in  the Roman  Martyrology  as  a  Martyr  under  Diocletian. It  is  more  likely  that  she  suffered under  Licinius  after  A.d.  307,  and  more  probable still  that  she  was  one  of  the  Sicilian  Martyrs  of the  Decian  persecution  (a.d.  250).  

EPIPHANIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  21)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  at  Pavia  in  Lombardy (a.d.  439),  and  elected  Bishop  of  that  city  in 467.  His  sanctity  and  his  gift  of  miracles  won him  great  credit  with  the  rulers  of  his  time — a credit  which  he  used  for  the  good  of  his  flock and  for  securing  peace  to  his  Church.  He rebuilt  Pavia  after  its  destruction  by  Odoacer. He  died  A.D.  497,  and  his  relics  were  translated (a.d.  963)  to  Hildesheim  in  Lower  Saxony. His  Life  (still  extant)  was  written  by  St. Ennodius,  his  successor.  

EPIPHANIUS,  DONATUS,  RUFINUS  and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  7)  
(Date  unknown.)  St.  Epiphanius  was  an African  Bishop  of  unknown  date  and  See. The  Martyrologies  commemorate  him  as  having suffered  for  Christ,  together  with  fifteen  of  his flock.  

EPIPHANIUS  of  SALAMIS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  12) (5th  cent.)  A  famous  Eastern  Father,  a native  of  Palestine  and  a  monk  from  his  earliest youth.  He  was  an  intimate  friend  of  St. Hilarion  and  later  of  St.  Jerome.  He  was called  to  Borne  for  his  counsel  by  Pope  St. Damasus,  and  was  in  so  great  repute  for  holiness of  life  and  for  learning  that  the  Arians  did  not dare  to  banish  him  from  his  See  of  Salamis (Costanza)  in  Cyprus,  though  they  had  driven almost  every  other  prominent  Catholic  Bishop into  exile.  He  preached  and  wrote  unceasingly against  the  heresies  of  his  own  and  preceding centuries  (the  confuting  in  detail  of  each  of which  is  the  subject-matter  of  his  best-known work),  and  was  a  pillar  of  the  Faith  against  the 
ERKENWALD 

(Jan.  24)  
(Sept.  15)  
(Aug.  11) Religious 

Arians,  as  also  against  the  errors  of  certain followers  of  Origen.  He  died  at  an  advanced age  a.d.  403.  

EPIPODIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  22)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  young  Christian  of  Lyons, who  with  his  friend  Alexander  was  discovered in  the  hiding-place  in  which  they  had  concealed themselves,  put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded on  account  of  their  religion  under  the  Emperor Marcus  Aurelius,  a.d.  178.  

EPISTEMIS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  5)  

See  SS.  GALATION  and  EPISTEMIS.  

EPITACIUS  and  BASILEUS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  23) (1st  cent.)  Epitacius  (variously  written Epictetus,  Epictritus,  &c.)  and  Basileus,  both looked  upon  as  Bishops  of  the  Apostolic  Age, have  been  in  veneration  in  Spain  from  time immemorial,  but  there  has  not  come  down  to us  any  reliable  account  of  their  lives  and asserted  martyrdom.  

EPOLONIUS  (St.)  M.  

See  SS.  BABYLAS,  URBAN, &c.  

EPVRE  (EVRE)  (St.)  Bp.  

Otherwise  St.  APRUS,  which  see.  

EQUITIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  

(6th  cent.)  The  Superior  of  a House  in  the  Province  of  Valeria  (a  district  to the  East  of  Rome).  Though  not  a  priest,  he preached  with  assiduity  and  success,  bringing many  sinners  back  to  God,  from  whom  he  had received  the  gift  of  the  working  of  miracles. His  life  of  prayer  and  penance  ended  March  7, A.D.  540  ;  but  his  Festival  is  kept  on  August  11, anniversary  of  the  Translation  of  his  relics  to Aquila.  St.  Gregory  the  Great  devotes  a considerable  portion  of  the  First  Book  of  his Dialogues  to  the  giving  an  account  of  the virtues  and  wonderful  works  of  St.  Equitius.  

ERARD  (EBERHARD,  EVERARD)  (Jan.  8) (St.)  Bp.  

(7th  cent.)  One  of  the  Irish  Apostles  of Bavaria,  who  is  said  to  have  been  Bishop  of Ardagh  before  setting  out  on  his  mission  to Germany.  He  flourished  in  the  seventh  century and  for  some  time  shared  the  solitude  of  St. Hidulphus  in  the  Vosges  mountains.  Ratisbon was  the  chief  centre  of  his  Apostolic  labours, and  it  was  there  that  he  died  (probably  A.d. 671)  and  that  his  relics  were  enshrined.  He is  said  to  have  been  canonised  by  Pope  St.  Leo IX.  Alban  Butler  states  St.  Erard  to  have been  a  Scotchman,  and  dates  him  considerably later,  giving  a.d.  753  as  the  year  of  his  death.  

ERASMA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  3)  

See  SS.  EUPHEMIA,  DOROTHEA, &c.  

ERASMUS  (ELMO)  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  2)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  some  town  in  Syria who,  after  resigning  his  See  and  living  seven years  as  a  solitary,  came  to  Antioch  during  the persecution  under  Diocletian.  Put  to  the torture  and  remanded  to  his  prison,  he,  like St.  Peter,  was  miraculously  freed  by  an  Angel. Later,  in  Illyricum  under  Maximian,  the  same experiences  befell  him.  He  died  peacefully  at Formiae  near  Gseta  (to  which  latter  town  his relics  were  translated  A.D.  842).  He  was  the object  of  great  and  widespread  popular  devotion throughout  the  Middle  Ages,  and  is  still  yearly commemorated  in  the  Liturgy.  

ERASMUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  25), 
(Date  unknown.)  A  Syrian  Christian  who suffered  for  the  Faith  at  Antioch  in  one  of  the early  persecutions.  He  may  possibly  be  one and  the  same  with  the  fourth  century  Martyr, Erasmus  of  June  2  ;  but  there  is  not  lacking evidence  that  he  was  a  distinct  personage. There  can  be  no  doubt  that  some  details  in  the traditional  story  of  St.  Erasmus  (June  2)  point to  a  confusion  between  him  and  some  other Martyr  of  the  same  name.  

ERASTUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (July  26)  
(First  cent.) The  Treasurer  of  the  city  of 
Corinth  (Rom.  xvi.  23),  converted  by  St.  Paul 
and  one  of  his  helpers  in  the  Apostolate  (Acts.  

xix.  22),  especially  at  Corinth  (2  Tim.  iv.  20). 

The  Greek  tradition  is  that  he  became  Bishop of  Philippi  Paneas  in  Palestine.  That  of  the Latins  that  his  See  was  Philippi  in  Macedonia, and  that  he  in  the  end  was  put  to  death  for  the Faith.  

♦ERBIN  (St.)  (May  29)  
(5th  cent.)  His  name  is  sometimes  written Erbyn  or  Ervan.  A  Cornish  Saint,  probably of  the  fifth  century.  Churches  are  dedicated to  him  and  his  name  appears  in  several  Calendars. He  seems  to  have  been  related  to  one  of the  Cornish  or  Devonian  chieftains  of  his  age. By  error,  his  name  has  sometimes  been  spelled Hermes,  confusing  him  with  the  ancient  Martyr of  that  name.  

♦ERC  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  2)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  Bishop  of  Slane, a  disciple  of  St.  Patrick,  who  died  at  the  age of  ninety  a.d.  513.  

ERCONGOTHA  (St.)  V.  (July  7)  
(7th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  King  Ercombert of  Kent  and  of  his  Queen  Sexburga.  With her  aunt,  St.  Ethelburga,  St.  Ercongotha embraced  the  Religious  life  at  Faremoutier  in France,  under  St.  Fara  or  Burgondophora, where  she  persevered  in  holiness  until  her death,  a.d.  660.  

ERCONWALD  (St.)  Bp.  (April  30)  

Otherwise  St.  ERKENWALD,  which  see.  

♦ERENTRUDE  (ARNDRUDA)  (St.)  V.  (June  30) (7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  sister  of  St. Rupert,  who  accompanied  him  to  his  Apostolate in  South  Germany,  and  for  whom  he  built  the monastery  of  Nimberg  near  Salzburg.  In  the eleventh  century  the  Emperor  St.  Henry  rebuilt her  church  and  shrine.  

♦ERFYL  (EUERFYL)  (St.)  V.  (July  5)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  British  maiden,  foundress and  title  Saint  of  the  church  of  Llanerfyl (Montgomery).  

♦ERGNAD  (ERCNACTA)  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  8)  
(5th  cent.)  This  holy  woman,  born  in  the present  county  Antrim,  is  said  to  have  received the  veil  from  St.  Patrick.  She  led  a  life  of  great penance,  and  her  closing  years  were  marked  by many  miracles.  

ERIC  (St.)  King,  M.  (May  18)  
(12th  cent.)  Eric  (a  name  identical  with Henry),  son-in-law  of  Smercher,  King  of  Sweden, was  elected  to  succeed  him  in  1141,  and  is described  as  both  the  father  and  the  servant of  his  people.  Having  in  battle  subdued  the Finns,  he  laboured  to  convert  them  to  Christianity, and  is  reckoned  the  Apostle  of  their country.  A  man  of  prayer,  he  built  many churches,  but  always  out  of  the  proceeds  of  his own  patrimony.  A  Pagan  faction,  headed  by Magnus,  son  of  the  King  of  Denmark,  compassed his  death,  a.d.  1151,  when  he  was  struck down  from  his  horse  and  beheaded  as  he  was leaving  the  church  after  hearing  Mass,  his  last thought  being  to  save  his  followers.  His  memory is  yet  held  in  benediction  among  the  Swedes.  

♦ERKEMBODON  (St.)  Bp.  (April  12)  
(8th  cent.)  Leaving  Ireland  in  company with  two  missionaries  who  were  murdered  on  the way,  St.  Erkembodon  entered  the  monastery of  St.  Omer,  where  he  was  elected  Abbot,  becoming afterwards  Bishop  of  St.  Omer  and  Terouanne.  He  died  a.d.  734.  Many  miracles  were wrought  at  his  shrine,  and  the  offerings  of pilgrims  were  soon  so  considerable  that  they sufficed  to  defray  the  cost  of  the  reconstruction of  the  Cathedral.  

ERKENWALD  (ERCONWALD)  (St.) (April  30) Bp.  

(7th  cent.)  A  Prince  of  East  Anglia  who, retiring  among  the  East  Saxons,  founded  out of  his  patrimony  the  two  famous  Abbeys  of Chertsey  for  monks  and  of  Barking  for  nuns. Consecrated  Bishop  of  London  (a.d.  675)  by  the Archbishop  St. Theodore,  he  governed  that See  for  eleven  years  until  his  death  in  a.d.  686. His  tomb  in  Old  St.  Paul's  was  famous  fat; miracles. His  Feast  is  also  kept  on  Nov.  

95

♦ERLULPH  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  10)  
(9th  cent.) A  Scottish  missionary  in  Germany 
who  later  became  Bishop  of  Werden,  and  in  the 
end  suffered  death  at  the  hands  of  the  Pagans 
(A.D.  830).  

♦ERMEL  (ERME)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  16)  

Otherwise  St.  ARMAGILLUS  (ARMEL) which  see.  

♦ERMELINDA  (St.)  V.  (Oct,  29)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Belgian  Saint  who  lived  a  life 
of  penance  in  a  little  cell  in  Brebant.  She  died 
about  A.D.  594,  and  her  relics  are  enshrined  at 
Meldert.  

♦EflMENBURGA  (St.)  Widow  (Nov.  19)  
(7th  cent.)  She  is  otherwise  known  as  Domna Ebba  (Lady  Ebba)  abbreviated  into  Domneva, She  was  a  Kentish  princess  married  to  Merewald, son  of  King  Penda  of  Mercia,  and  the  mother  of the  three  holy  virgins  SS.  Milburga,  Mildred  and Mildgith.  In  her  old  age  she  founded  the  Abbey of  Minster  in  Thanet,  where  the  place-name Ebb's  Fleet  still  perpetuates  her  memory.  The date  of  her  death  some  time  after  A.D.  650  is uncertain.  

♦ERMENGYTHA  (St.)  V.  (July  30)  
(7th cent.)  A sister of St. Ermenburga 
(Domneva)  who  lived  in  great  fervour  in  her 
sister's monastery at Minster in Thanet,

♦ERMENILDA  (St.)  Queen.  (Feb.  13)  
(7th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  King  Erconbert of  Kent  and  his  wife,  St.  Sexburga.  She married  Wulfhere  of  Mercia  and  became  the mother  of  St.  Wereberga.  On  the  death  of her  husband  she  joined  her  mother  in  the Abbey  of  Minster  in  Sheppey,  embracing  like her  the  Religious  life,  and  eventually  succeeding her  as  Abbess.  Later,  mother  and  daughter are  found  together  again  at  St.  Etheldreda's monastery  at  Ely,  where  both  finished  their earthly  pilgrimage.  The  death  of  St.  Ermenilda may  have  taken  place  about  A.D.  700.  

♦ERMINOLD  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  6)  
(12th  cent.)  A  monk  and  Abbot  in  South 
Germany.  A  man  of  very  holy  life.  He  was

ERMINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  25)  
(8th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Laon  in  France,  who at  the  invitation  of  St.  Ursmar,  Abbot-Bishop of  Lobbes  (near  Liege),  fixed  his  abode  in  that monastery  and  followed  so  carefully  the  example of  his  holy  Abbot  that  he  was  chosen  by  him to  be  his  successor  (A.D.  713).  St.  Erminus  was conspicuous  for  his  gift  of  prophecy.  He  died at  an  advanced  age  A.D.  737.  

♦ERNAN  (St.)  (Aug.  18)  
(7th  cent.)  A  nephew  of  St.  Columba  and sometime  missionary  to  the  Picts.  He  later returned  to  Ireland  and  founded  a  monastery in  Donegal,  and  possibly  another  in  Wicklow.

♦ERNEST  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  7)  
(12th  cent.)  An  Abbot  in  the  South  of Germany  who  joined  one  of  the  Crusades  and after  his  arrival  in  Asia  devoted  himself  to  the work  of  preaching  the  Gospels  to  the  Infidels. He  suffered  martyrdom,  it  is  said,  at  Mecca, A.D.  1148.  

"ERNEST  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  7)  
(12th  cent.)  A  Benedictine  Abbot  in  the South  of  Germany,  who  joined  in  one  of  the Crusades  and  strove  to  propagate  Christianity in  Palestine.  Thence  he  penetrated  into  Persia, and  finally  made  his  way  into  Arabia,  where  he was  put  to  death  by  the  Infidels  (a.d.  1148).  

♦ERNEY  (St.).  

(Date unknown.) The Patron Saint of a 96 

church  in  Cornwall,  whose  history  has  not  been traced.  He  may  be  identical  with  St.  Ernan. It  appears  that  there  were  several  Celtic  Saints of  this  or  of  a  verv  similar  name. EROTHEIDES  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  27)  

See  SS.  CAPITOLINA  and  EROTHEIDES. EROTIS  (EROTEIS)  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  6)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  of  the  fourth  century who  perished  at  the  stake  (it  would  seem)  in Greece,  though  by  some  she  is  identified  with St.  Eroteides  of  Cappadocia,  who  suffered  with St.  Capitolina. *ERTH  (HERYGH,  URITH).  (Oct,  31)  
(6th  cent.)  Brother  to  St.  Uny  and  St.  la (Ives).  He  crossed  from  Ireland  into  Cornwall, and  was  held  in  such  veneration  that  a  church was  dedicated  in  his  honour.  He  has  given  his name  to  the  village  of  St.  Erth. *ERVAN  (St.)  (May  29)  

Otherwi.se  St.  ERBYN  (ERBIN),  which  see. *ERVAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  16)  

Otherwise  St.  ARMAGILLUS,  which  see. ESDRAS  (EZRA)  (St.)  Prophet.  (July  13)  
(6th  cent.  B.C.)  Two  canonical  Books  of Holy  Scripture  bear  his  superscription,  and  two others,  rejected  by  the  Catholic  Church  and Apocryphal,  were  formerly  attributed  to  him. He  collected  the  inspired  works  of  those  who had  preceded  him,  and  is  by  many  thought  to have  written  the  Books  of  Parallelipomenon or  Chronicles.  The  tradition  is  that  he  lived to  a  great  age  in  Jerusalem  after  the  return from  the  Captivity  of  Babylon.  The  ancient hypothesis  that  he  was  one  and  the  same  with the  Prophet  Malachi  must  be  rejected.  Esdras is  said  to  have  introduced  the  practice  of  writing Hebrew  uniformly  from  right  to  left  instead  of, as  was  done  before  his  time,  alternately  from right  to  left  and  from  left  to  right. *ESKILL  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  13)  
(11th  cent.)  A  fellow-missionary  to  Sweden with  St.  Sigfrid,  who  consecrated  him  as  Bishop. His  zeal  for  justice  led  to  his  being  cruelly done  to  death  by  unbelievers  about  the  middle of  the  eleventh  century. *ESTERWINE  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  7)

His  humbleness and  gentleness,  ensured  by  constant  prayer, earned  him  his  place  among  the  Saints.

about  him  is  that  he  was  at  that  period  a  strenuous upholder  of  the  Catholic  Faith  against  the Arians.  He  ended  his  holy  life  by  martyrdom, but  whether  at  the  hands  of  heretics  or  of Pagans  is  unknown. EUGENIUS  (EUGENE)  (St.)  P.  (Jan.  4)

(7th  cent.)  While  Pope  St.  Martin  I  was  in banishment  in  the  Chersonesus,  whither  he  had been  exiled  by  the  Emperor  Constans,  Eugenius, a  Roman  by  birth,  acted  as  his  Vicar  in  the West.  And  when  it  became  known  that  St. Martin  had  died  from  the  ill-usage  he  had received  (a.d.  654),  St.  Eugenius  was  chosen to  succeed  him.  Affable  to  all,  his  great characteristic  was  his  care  of  the  poor.  He maintained  that  the  revenues  of  the  Church were  their  patrimony.  He  bravely  and  skilfully combated  the  subtle  Monothelite  heresy  (that which  denied  to  Christ  a  human  will),  and  after a  short  Pontificate,  passed  away  a.d.  657,  and was  buried  in  St.  Peter's. EUGENIUS,  SALUTARIS,  MURITTA  and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  13)  
(6th  cent.)  The  entry  in  the  Roman  Martyrology  regarding  these  Saints  is  as  follows : "  In  Africa,  the  holy  confessors,  Eugenius, Bishop  of  Carthage,  renowned  for  his  Faith and  his  virtues,  and  all  the  clergy  of  that  Church to  the  number  of  five  hundred  or  more  (among them  being  many  young  boys  who  ministered as  Lectors  or  Readers).  In  the  persecution under  the  Arian  Hunneric,  King  of  the  Vandals, they  were  scourged  and  starved,  and  at  last (rejoicing  always  in  the  Lord)  driven  into banishment.  Conspicuous  among  them  was the  Archdeacon  Salutaris  and  the  Dignitary next  in  rank  to  him,  Muritta,  who  had  each twice  previously  suffered  for  Christ."  a.d.  505 is  the  probable  date  of  the  sentence  passed  on St.  Eugene  and  Ms  holy  companions.

The  first  presided  over  that  See  from  a.d.  636 to  a.d.  647,  and  subscribed  the  Acts  of  the fifth  Council  of  Toledo.  He  was  eminent  not only  for  piety  and  sacred  learning,  but  also  for proficiency  in  the  science  of  his  age.  His successor,  also  a  monk  by  name  Eugene,  was Bishop  from  A.D.  647  to  a.d.  657.  He  too  took part  in  various  Councils,  and  to  other  accomplishments added  that  of  being  a  poet.  Some of  his  writings  are  still  extant. EUGENIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  15)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  fellowv/orker  with St.  Denis  of  Paris,  whose  date  consequently depends  on  that  of  the  first  evangelisation  of Central  and  Northern  France,  whether  it  be placed  in  the  first  or  in  the  third  century  of  the Christian  era.  St.  Eugene  while  engaged  in missionary  work  near  Paris,  was  seized  and put  to  death  by  the  Pagans.

EUGENIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  30)  
(Date  unknown.)  Beyond  the  fact  that  a Saint  of  this  name  has  from  the  earliest  times been  honoured  in  the  Liturgy  of  the  Church  of Milan  on  this  day,  as  Bishop  of  that  See,  no record  of  him  remains. EUGRAPHUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  10)  

See  SS.  MENNAS,  HERMOGENES,  &c. EULALIA  of  BARCELONA  (St.)  V.M. (Sspk  12)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  of  Barcelona who  suffered  many  tortures,  and  in  the  end was  crucified  or  (as  others  say)  burned  to  death at  the  stake  in  that  city  under  Diocletian A.D.  304.  She  is  the  Patron  Saint  of  Barcelona, and  is  also  much  venerated  in  the  South  of France,  where  her  name  is  variously  written, Aulausie,  Aulaire,  Otaille,  <fec. EULALIA  of  MERIDA  (St.)  V.M.  (Dec.  10)  
(4th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Merida  and Oviedo  in  Spain,  in  which  latter  city  her  relics are  venerated.  Like  St.  Eulalia  of  Barcelona, she  was  a  Christian  maiden  put  to  death  for  the Faith  in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian a.d.  304.  After  undergoing  many  tortures  she perished  at  the  stake.  At  the  moment  of  her death  a  white  dove  was  seen  issuing  from  her mouth,  and  over  her  ashes,  cast  into  a  field, the  Heavens  forthwith  spread  a  pall  of  snow. The  modern  theory  that  she  is  one  and  the same  with  her  namesake  and  contemporary  of Barcelona  is  unconvincing. EULAMPIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  10)

They  were  thereupon beheaded  ;  but  their  courage  led  to  the  conversion of  two  hundred  soldiers,  witnesses  of their  martyrdom,  and  who  themselves  were likewise  put  to  death  as  Christians.

He was  seized  and  bravely  gave  his  life  for  the Faith  (probably  A.D.  859).  Some  of  his  writings, notably  his  Memoriale  Sanctorum,  are  still extant.  He  had  been  for  his  great  merits elected  Archbishop  of  Toledo,  but  was  taken from  this  world  before  being  consecrated. EULOGIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  5)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Edessa,  who  when the  Emperor  Valens  intruded  an  Arian  Bishop and  exiled  all  those  of  the  clergy  who  refused him  Communion,  was  banished  to  the  Thebaid (Egypt),  where  he  devoted  himself  successfully to  the  conversion  of  the  still  Pagan  people  of the  district.  At  the  death  of  Valens  (A.D.  375) he  returned  to  Edessa,  became  Bishop  of  that city,  and  as  such  attended  the  Ecumenical Council  of  Constantinople  (a.d.  381). EULOGIUS  of  ALEXANDRIA  (St.)  Bp. (Sept.  13)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Syrian  by  birth  and  a  monk from  early youth, who laboured with great 

fruit  for  the  reform  of  morals  and  the  strengthening of  orthodox  belief  among  his  compatriots, many  of  whom  had  been  seduced  by  the  Eutychians  or  Monophysites.  Eulogius  was  Patriarch of  Alexandria  from  A.D.  579  to  A.D.  607. Photius  gives  an  account  of  his  writings  in  terms of  high  praise.  His  correspondence  with  his friend  St.  Gregory  the  Great  (whose  letters to  him  are  extant)  is  interesting.  One  of  the Epistles  contains  St.  Gregory's  account  of  his having  sent  St.  Augustine  to  England.  

EULOGIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  3)  
(4th cent.) Martyrs at Constantinople in 
the  time  of  the  Arian  Emperor  Valens  (a.d.  

364-376) ;  but  of  whom  particulars  are  lacking.  

EUMENIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  18)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  saintly  Bishop  of  Gortyna  in Crete,  conspicuous  for  his  charity.  He  died  in exile  in  the  Thebaid  in  Upper  Egypt,  or  perhaps at  Thebes  in  Bceotia  (Greece).  He  flourished in  the  latter  half  of  the  third  century.  For the  many  miracles  he  wrought  in  life  and after  death,  he  has  become  known  as  the Thaumaturgus  or  Wonder-worker.  His  relics were  translated  to  Crete  in  the  seventh  century.  

♦EUNAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  23)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Saint  whose  zeal  and  good works  were  so  eminent  that  he  has  come  to  be venerated  as  the  Patron  Saint  of  his  Diocese of  Raphoe  in  Ulster.  By  many  he  is  supposed to  be  the  St.  Adamnan  of  Iona  who  wrote  the Life  of  St.  Columba.  In  that  case,  he,  after establishing  Raphoe,  must  have  retired,  as  was not  uncommon  in  his  time,  to  the  Scottish monastery  to  end  his  days  in  the  cloister.

have  come  down  to  us.  

EUPHEMIA  (St.)  M.  (March  20)  

See  SS.  ALEXANDRA,  CLAUDIA, &c.  

EUPHEMIA,  DOROTHEA,  THECLA  and 
ERASMA  (SS.)  VV.MM.  (Sept.  3)  
(1st  cent.)  The  two  first  were  daughters  of Valentius,  a  Pagan  nobleman  of  Aquileia,  and the  two  others,  daughters  of  his  brother  Valentinianus,  a  Christian.  The  Pagan  Valentius having  heard  of  their  Baptism  had  them  all arrested.  After  having  been  put  to  the  torture they  were  beheaded  (it  is  alleged  by  Valentius's own  hand)  and  their  bodies  cast  into  a  river near  Aquileia.  Their  martyrdom  took  place in  the  first  century  of  the  Christian  era.  They are  venerated  at  Venice  and  also  at  Ravenna.  

EUPHEMIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  A  youthful  Christian  maiden, burned  at  the  stake  for  the  Faith  of  Christ, in  the  city  of  Chalcedon,  under  the  Emperor Galerius,  about  a.d.  307.  She  had  long  before taken  a  vow  of  virginity,  and  by  her  sober attire  made  known  to  all  men  that  she  had forsaken  the  world.  Unheard-of  tortures appear  to  have  preceded  her  gaining  of  the  crown of  martyrdom,  for  which  she  had  always proclaimed  that  she  longed.  A  realistic  picture in  the  great  church  of  the  Council  of  Chalcedon (celebrated  a  century  and  a  half  later  under her  patronage)  portrays  her  sufferings.  She is  honoured  as  one  of  the  chief  Martyrs  of  the Greek  Church,  and  her  festival  is  a  holiday over  almost  all  the  East.  Her  relics,  rescued from  the  destructive  fury  of  the  Iconoclasts, were  translated  (a.d.  750)  to  the  church  of St.  Sophia  in  Constantinople,  and  were  in  great veneration  until  their  destruction  (A.D.  1452) by  the  Turks.

EUPHRASIA 
EUPHRASIA  (St.)  V.  (March  13)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Virgin  of  Constantinople, nearly  allied  in  blood  to  the  Emperors,  Theodosius  the  Great,  and  Areadius.  A  year  after her  birth  (A.D.  380)  her  father  died,  and  her  pious mother  withdrew  with  her  daughter  to  Egypt, where  she  had  large  estates,  and  fixed  her  abode near  a  great  monastery  of  one  hundred  and thirty  nuns.  When  of  age  to  judge  for  herself Euphrasia  elected  to  join  the  community. The  nuns  received  the  novice  but  refused  to accept  the  wealth  offered  with  her ;  and Euphrasia  thenceforth  lived  in  poverty,  as required  by  their  severe  rule,  until  her  death (A.D.  410).  To  the  Emperor  Theodosius  the Younger,  who  had  had  designs  to  give  her  in marriage  to  a  Senator  of  distinction,  Euphrasia had  at  the  outset  written  a  touching  letter beseeching  him  to  distribute  her  rich  patrimony to  the  poor,  which  he  faithfully  did.

EUPHRASIUS  (St.)  Pp.,  M.  (Jan.  14)  
(Date  unknown. )  Perhaps  identical  with Eucrathius,  a  correspondent  of  St.  Cyprian, and  therefore  a  Saint  of  the  third  century. Others  hold  that  he  was  a  Saint  and  Martyr in  Africa  of  the  time  of  the  Vandal  persecution in  the  fifth  century.

EUPHROMIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  3)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Autun  in  France, friend  of  St.  Lupus  of  Troyes,  and  zealous  like him  for  orthodoxy  and  discipline.  He  assisted at  the  Council  of  Aries  in  A.D.  475,  but  the precise  date  of  his  death  is  unknown.  

EUPHRONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  4)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  A.D.  530  of  senatorial  family and  dedicated  to  God  from  his  youth,  he illustrated  by  his  virtues  the  See  of  St.  Martin, being  the  eighteenth  Bishop  of  Tours.  When this  city  was  burned  down  during  his  Episcopate, besides  comforting  and  aiding  his  flock,  he re-erected  several  churches.  He  died  A.D.  573, having  been  seventeen  years  a  Bishop,  and  was succeeded  by  the  famous  Saint  Gregory  the Historian.  

EUPHROSYNA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  1)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  maiden,  born  at Alexandria  of  pious  Christian  parents.  When she  was  to  be  married,  despite  her  resolve  to consecrate  her  virginity  to  God,  she  (it  is  said) entered  in  male  attire  a  monastery  of  monks whose  Abbot  was  her  father's  friend.  She  took this  extraordinary  step  because  she  knew  that her  father  would  search  all  convents  of  nuns and  drag  her  out.  For  thirty-eight  years  she lived  unknown  in  a  retired  cell  and  utterly  alone, and  was  looked  upon  by  all  as  a  singularly  holy man.  Even  her  father,  wanting  spiritual  advice, was  introduced  to  her,  and  greatly  appreciated her  wise  counsels.  He  assisted  at  her  last moments,  and  only  then  did  she  disclose  her identity.  After  her  death,  about  A.D.  470,  her father  himself  took  possession  of  her  cell,  where he  passed  the  rest  of  his  days  in  penance  and praver.

EUPLIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  12)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  at  Catania  in  Sicily (A.D.  304).  He  was  in  deacon's  orders  and openly  proclaimed  himself  a  Christian,  carrying about  with  him  a  Book  of  the  Gospels,  a  proceeding directly  contrary  to  the  Edicts  of  the Emperor  Diocletian.  Put  on  the  rack  and bidden  to  worship  Apollo,  Mars  and  iEsculapius, he  replied  that  he  adored  only  the  Father,  the Son  and  the  Holy  Ghost.  After  his  execution  the Christians  carried  off  his  body  and  embalmed  it.

that  he  was  sent  thither  as  a  missionary  by  the 
Apostle  St.  Peter  himself.

EUPSYCHIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  9)  
(4th  cent.)  A  young  patrician  of  Caesarea in  Cappadocia.  Julian  the  Apostate,  learning that  the  Temple  of  Fortune  in  that  city  had been  destroyed,  ordered  a  special  persecution of  Christiana  to  appease  the  gods.  Eupsychius, accused  of  the  crime,  was  cruelly  tortured  and beheaded  (a.d.  362).  

EUPSYCHIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  7)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Csesarea  in Cappadocia  who,  arrested  under  the  Emperor Hadrian,  after  having  distributed  all  his  goods to  the  poor,  was  savagely  tortured  and  beheaded (a.d.  130,  about).  

♦EURFYL  (St.)  V.  (July  5)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Patron  Saint  of Llanerfyl  (Montgomery).  Nothing  concerning her  has  come  down  to  our  times.  

♦EURGAIN  (St.)  V.  (June  30)  
(6th  cent.)  A  daughter  of  the  chieftain Caradog  in  Glamorgan,  foundress  of  CorEurgain,  afterwards  Llantwit. — Another  St. Eurgain,  wife  of  a  princeling  in  North  Wales, founded  Llan-Eurgain  in  Flintshire.  

EUSEBIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  29)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  of  Bergamo in  Lombardy,  niece  of  St.  Domnio,  who  like  him was  beheaded  under  Maximian  Herculeus, towards  the  close  of  the  third  century.  As about  St.  Domnio,  the  ancient  Martyrologies are  silent  concerning  St.  Eusebia.  Such  details as  we  have  come  from  local  traditions.  Their bodies  were  found  and  enshrined  A.D.  1401.  

♦EUSEBIUS  (St.)  (Jan.  30)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Saint  who,  leaving  Ireland, repaired  to  the  monastery  of  St.  Gall  (Switzerland), where  he  practised  great  mortification, was  gifted  with  prophecy  and  miracles,  and  by his  sanctity  attracted  the  veneration  even  of the  princes  and  nobles  of  his  time. — Another St.  Eusebius  of  the  same  or  earlier  date  is  also in  honour  as  a  monk  of  St.  Gall,  and  is  said  to have  suffered  martyrdom.  But  particulars are  lacking  and  dates  quite  uncertain.  

EUSEBIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  5) (Date  unknown.)  Ten  Martyrs  supposed  to have  suffered  in  Africa,  but  at  what  period  or under  what  circumstances  is  unknown.  The word  Eusebius  in  the  manuscript  Martyrologies is  followed  by  the  word  Palatinus  ;  but  whether the  word  Palatinus  expresses  the  qualification of  St.  Eusebius  as  an  official,  or  is  the  name  of one  of  his  fellow-martyrs,  is  uncertain.  

EUSEBIUS,  NEON,  LEONTIUS,  LONGINUS  and OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  24)  
(Date  uncertain.)  According  to  the  Greek Menologies,  bystanders  eight  in  number,  who, converted  to  Christianity  on  witnessing  the martyrdom  of  St.  George,  were  themselves  put to  death  on  the  morrow.  

EUSEBIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  28)  

See  SS.  APHRODISIUS,  CARALIPPUS,  Ac 
♦EUSEBIUS  (St.)  Hermit.  (Feb.  15)  
(5th  cent.)  A  holy  recluse  of  Asehia  in  Syria, venerated  in  the  East.  

♦EUSEBIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Martyr  in  Palestine  under Maximian  Herculeus  the  colleague  of  Diocletian, towards  the  close  of  the  third  century. He  is  commemorated  in  the  ancient  Martyrologies.  

EUSEBIUS  of  SAMOSATA  (St.)  Bp. (June  21)  
(4th  cent.)  The  "  Light-bearer  to  the  world," 
as he is styled by St. Gregory Nazianzen. 
EUSTACHIUS 

Bishop  of  Samosata  from  A.D.  361,  this Syrian  Saint  was  loved  and  venerated  throughout the  East.  Especially  devoted  to  him  was the  great  St.  Basil.  Not  only  zealous  but skilful  in  doing  his  part  in  the  struggle  against the  Arians,  it  was  not  until  A.D.  374  that  they succeeded  in  driving  St.  Eusebius  into  exile. He  was  banished  into  Thrace,  but  recalled  four years  later  by  the  Emperor  Gratian.  He  had always  longed  to  give  his  life  for  Christ  as  a Martyr  ;  and  in  fact  his  death  came  about, A.D.  379  (or  perhaps  A.D.  380)  by  the  act  of  an Arian  woman  who  threw  down  a  heavy  tile from  the  roof  of  a  house  on  his  head.  His  last word  was  to  beg  that  she  might  be  pardoned both  by  God  and  by  man. EUSEBIUS  of  MILAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  12)  
(5th  cent.)  Probably  a  Greek  by  birth,  the successor  of  St.  Lazarus  in  the  See  of  Milan. He  was  of  great  assistance  to  Pope  St.  Leo  the Great  in  that  Pontiff's  efforts  to  repress  the Eutychian  heresy.  He  restored  the  churches of  Milan,  rebuilt  the  city  walls,  replaced  the books  burned  by  the  barbarians  in  their  inroads, and  reformed  Church  discipline  in  the  North of  Italy.  He  died  A.D.  465,  after  sixteen  years of  Episcopate. EUSEBIUS  (St.)  (Aug.  14)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  priest,  sometimes honoured  as  a  Martyr,  he  having  ended  his  days in  a  prison  (A.D.  357)  during  the  Arian  troubles fostered  even  in  Home  by  the  Emperor  Constantius.  Into  the  controversy  among  the learned  regarding  the  attitude  of  St.  Eusebius towards  the  Pontiffs,  Liberius  and  St.  Felix  II, it  is  not  necessary  to  enter.  That  Liberius never  swerved  from  orthodoxy  is  clear.  It  is perhaps  equally  so  that  St.  Eusebius  did  not endorse  his  policy  in  the  difficult  circumstances of  the  times,  and  thereby  forfeited  the  Pontiff's favour.  After  the  death  of  St.  Eusebius, Pope  and  people  joined  in  venerating  his memory  ;  and  eight  years  later  St.  Damasus, who  shared  his  views,  was  elected  to  the  Supreme Pontificate. EUSEBIUS,  PONTIANUS,  VINCENT  and 
PEREGRINUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  25)  
(2nd  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Home  under  Coinmodus  (a.d.  192).  Their  relics  were  translated to  France  in  the  ninth  century. EUSEBIUS,  NESTULUS  and  ZENO  (Sept.  8)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Three  brothers  of  Gaza  in  Palestine who  were  set  upon  as  Christians  by  a  Pagan mob,  frenzied  with  delight  at  the  news  of  the apostasy  of  the  Emperor  Julian  (A.D.  362). The  Martyrs  were  dragged  about  the  streets  of the  city,  maltreated  with  savage  ferocity, and  at  last  cast  into  a  lire  kindled  for  the purpose  on  the  town  refuse-heap. EUSEBIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept,  21)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Martyr  in  Phenicia  of unknown  date,  who  appears  to  have  given himself  up  voluntarily  as  a  Christian  and  to have  gone  through  excruciating  torture  before being  executed.  The  Greek  Martyrologies which  celebrate  his  fortitude  are  silent  as  to the  place  and  particulars  of  his  Passion. EUSEBIUS  (St.)  Pope.  (Sept.  26)  
(4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Marcellus in  the  Chair  of  St.  Peter  (A.D.  310).  He strenuously  upheld  the  discipline  of  the  Church and  opposed  any  undue  laxity  in  applying the  so-called  Penitential  Canons,  enforced  on Christians  who  had  failed  in  courage  during  the persecutions.  He  himself  was  at  once  called upon  to  suffer  for  Christ,  being  banished  to Sicily,  where  he  died  after  a  short  Pontificate of  less  than  five  months.  Fragments  of  his epitaph  written  by  Pope  St.  Damasus  have been  found  in  the  Roman  Catacombs  whither his  remains  were  brought  for  interment. EUSEBIUS  of  BOLOGNA  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  26)  
(4th  cent.)  A  friend  of  St.  Ambrose  of  Milan, who  became  Bishop  of  Bologna  about  A.D.  370. 

He  was  a  prudent  and  learned  Prelate.  He assisted  at  the  Council  of  Aquileia  (A.D.  380) against  the  Arians.  Warned  in  a  vision,  he discovered  the  concealed  relics  of  the  Holy Martyrs  Vitalis  and  Agricola,  and  reverently enshrined  them.  At  his  death  (A.D.  400)  he was  succeeded  by  St.  Felix. EUSEBIUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  4)

MUS,  ADRIAS, PAULINA, NEON, MARY, 
MARTANA  and  AURELIA  (SS.)MM.  (Dec.  2)  
(3rd  cent.)  Christians  arrested  as  such  in Rome  in  the  time  of  the  Emperor  Valerian (A.D.  254-259),  and  after  torture  put  to  death. Eusebius,  a  priest,  and  Marcellus  his  deacon, were  beheaded  ;  Adrias  and  Hippolytus  were scourged  to  death  ;  Paulina  died  in  the  torturechamber  ;  Neon  and  Mary  were  beheaded,  and Maximus  was  thrown  into  the  Tiber. EUSEBIUS  of  VERCELLI  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Dec.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  He  was  by  birth  a  native  of Sardinia ;  and  after  passing  some  years  in Rome  as  a  priest,  he  was  consecrated  Bishop of  Vercelli  in  the  present  Province  of  Piedmont (A.D.  340).  A  great  and  active  champion  of the  Catholic  Faith  against  the  Arians,  he  was banished  by  their  machinations  to  Syria,  where he  underwent  many  hardships.  Before  returning to  Vercelli  under  Julian  he  visited  St. Athanasius  at  Alexandria.  In  the  words  of St.  Jerome :  "  On  the  return  of  Eusebius, Italy  put  off  her  mourning."  Thenceforth  to the  year  of  his  death  (a.d.  370)  he  devoted himself,  in  concert  with  St.  Hilary  of  Poitiers, to  the  extirpation  of  Arianism.  By  exception, on  account  of  the  much  that  he  went  through in  the  cause  of  religion,  he  is  honoured  liturgically  as  a  Martyr. EUSIGNIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  An  old  soldier  of  the  army  of Constantius  Chlorus  who,  surviving  to  the  age of  one  hundred  and  ten  years,  refused  to  sacrifice to  idols  at  the  bidding  of  Julian  the  Apostate, and  was  scourged  and  beheaded  as  a  Christian at  Antioch  in  Syria  (a.d.  362). EUSTACE.  

Saints  of  this  name  will  be  found  described under  the  name  EUSTACHIUS,  the  Latin  and Ecclesiastical  equivalent. EUSTACHIUS, THEOPISTES, AGAPITUS 
and  THEOPISTUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  20)  
(2nd  cent.)  According  to  traditional  accounts, a  Roman  family  of  distinction — Eustace,  an  officer,  his  wife,  Thcopista,  and  his sons  Agapius  and  Theopistus — were  put  to death  as  Christians  under  Hadrian  (A.D.  118). Their  Acts,  as  we  have  them,  are  untrustworthy, but  their  cultus  is  universal  in  the  East  as  in the  West.  Their  relics  are  asserted  to  have been  conveyed  to  Paris  from  their  church  in Rome  in  the  twelfth  century.  They  were destroyed  (A.D.  1567)  by  the  Huguenots.  A curious  theory  makes  St.  Eustachius  (otherwise Placidus)  identical  with  a  personage  mentioned by  Joscphus,  and  thus  a  Saint  of  the  Apostolic Ace. EUSTACHIUS  (St.)  (Oct.  12)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  authorities  are  in complete  disagreement  as  to  who  this  St. Eustachius  was.  His  date  is  quite  unknown. Some  with  the  Roman  Martyrology  describe him  as  a  priest  and  Confessor  in  Syria  ;  others with  the  Bollandists  make  of  him  an  Egyptian Martyr. EUSTACHIUS,  THESPESIUS  and  ANATOLIUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  20)  
(3rd  cent.)  Christians  who  gained  the crown  of  martyrdom  at  Nieaja  in  Asia  Minor in  the  persecution  under  the  Emperor  Maximums the  Thracian  (a.d.  235).

EUSTACHIUS 
EUSTACHIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  28)  

See  SS.  VALERIAN,  URBAN, Ac. EUSTASIUS  (EUSTATHIUS,  EUSTOCHIUS)  
(St.)  Abbot.  (March  29)  
(7th cent.) The successor of his master 
St.  Columbanus  as  Abbot  of  Luxeuil  in  a.d.  611.  

He sanctified himself by continual prayer, 
watchings  and  fasting.  He  ruled  over  about 
six hundred monks, and was the spiritual 
father  of  many  holy  Bishops  and  Saints. He 
died  a.d.  C26,  having  been  Abbot  for  fifteen 
vears.  

EUSTATHIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  16)  
(4th  cent.) A  native  of  Sida  in  Pamphylia 
who,  as  St.  Athanasius  assures  us,  had  confessed 
the  Faith  of  Christ  before  the  Pagan  persecutors, 
and  was  a  man  of  eloquence,  learning  and  virtue.  

He  was  made  Bishop  of  Berea  in  Syria,  and 
thence  reluctantly  translated  to  the  Patriarchal 
See  of  Antioch.  He  assisted  at  the  General 
Council  of  Nice,  where  he  opposed  the  practice 
of  translating  Bishops  from  one  See  to  another.  

He  contended  against  the  Arians,  being  the 
first,  according  to  St.  Jerome,  to  do  so  with 
the pen.  Eusebius of Nicomedia sought to 
have him removed from Antioch and by 
calumnies  succeeded  in  deceiving  the  Emperor 
Constantine  and  in  procuring  his  banishment, 
first  to  Treves  then  to Illyricum,  where his 
virtues  shone  with  the  brightest  lustre.  He 
died  at  Philippi  in  Macedonia,  about  a.d.  337.  

EUSTATHIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  28)  
(Date  unknown.) A  Martyr  in  Galatia  who 
after  torture  appears  to  have  been  cast  into  a 
river.  The  Greek  Menology  has  much  amplified 
the  little  genuine  tradition  records  of  him.  

EUSTERIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  19)  
(5th cent.)  The fourth Bishop  of Salerno 
near Naples, who seems to have flourished 
about  the  middle  of  the  fifth  century,  but  all 
particulars  concerning  him  have  been  lost.  

EUSTOCHIA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  28)  

Otherwise  St.  EUSTOCHIUM,  which  sec.
♦EUSTOCHIUM  (Bl.)  V.  (Feb.  13)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Benedictine  nun  of  Padua  in Italy,  wonderful  for  her  patience  in  the  many fearful  trials  and  sufferings  with  which  Almighty God  was  pleased  to  allow  the  devil  to  afflict  her during  the  whole  course  of  her  short  life.  She died  at  the  age  of  twenty-four  (a.d.  1469). EUSTOCHIUM  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  28)  
(5th  cent.)  The  third  and  best-loved  daughter of  St.  Paula,  the  Roman  matron  who  followed St.  Jerome  to  Palestine.  She  joined  her  mother at  Bethlehem  and  lived  a  saintly  life  with  her  in the  nunnery  founded  by  the  latter  under  the guidance  of  St.  Jerome.  Eventually  she  succeeded (A.D.  404)  to  the  government  of  the community,  and  died  A.D.  419.  One  of  the finest  treatises  of  St.  Jerome  is  addressed  to  her. She  spoke  Greek  and  Latin  with  equal  fluency, and  learned  Hebrew  so  as  to  be  able  to  chant the  Psalms  in  the  original  tongue. EUSTOCHIUM  (St.)  V.M.  (Nov.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  Julian  the  Apostate  having ordered  public  sacrifices  in  honour  of  Venus, Eustochium,  a  fervent  Christian  of  Tarsus  in Cilicia,  refused  to  comply  with  the  Edict. She  was  in  consequence  tried  and  barbarously tortured,  but  afterwards,  while  engaged  in prayer,  peacefully  gave  up  her  soul  to  God (A.D.  362). EUSTOCHIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  19)  
(5th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Brictius  in the  See  of  St.  Martin  of  Tours  in  the  fifth century,  and,  according  to  St.  Gregory  of Tours,  "  a  prelate  of  resplendent  holiness." He  died  a.d.  461,  having  been  seventeen  years a  Bishop.  He  attended  the  Council  of  Angers, a.d. 453,  and  some  of  his  writings  are  still 
EUSTOCHIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  16)  

See  SS.  ELPIDIUS,  MARCELLUS, &c.  

EUSTOLIA  and  SOPATRA  (SS.)  VV.  (Nov.  9) (7th  cent.)  One  or  both  of  these  holy 102 

virgins  was  a  daughter  of  the  Emperor  Maurice of  Constantinople  (A.D.  582-602).  They  were from  the  beginning  revered  as  Saints  in  the East,  and  at  a  very  early  date  their  names  were inserted  in  the  Roman  Martyrology. EUSTORGIUS  (St.)  (April  11)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Nicomedia  in  Asia Minor  who  suffered  for  the  Faith  in  one  of  the persecutions,  perhaps  that  of  Diocletian,  about the  year  300 ;  but  it  is  not  proved  that  he  was actually  put  to  death. EUSTORGIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  6)  
(6th  cent.)  The  second  Bishop  of  Milan  of that  name  who,  after  living  for  a  long  time in  Rome,  became  Bishop  of  Milan  (a.d.  512). He  converted  the  Hungarian  Laurianus,  afterwards Bishop  of  Seville  in  Spain  and  Martyr. He  was  conspicuous  for  his  self-sacrificing charity  to  the  poor,  and  ransomed  many  of  his flock  taken  prisoners  in  the  savage  wars  of  his time.  He  died  A.D.  518. EUSTORGIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  18)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Greek,  traditionally  held  to have  been  an  official  in  the  service  of  the Emperor  Constantine  the  Great.  He  was elected  Bishop  of  Milan  in  succession  to  St. Maternus,  or  possibly  St.  Mirocles.  He  appears from  a  letter  of  St.  Athanasius  to  have  suffered for  the  Faith,  and  to  have  written  in  defence of  orthodoxy  against  the  Arians.  To  him  is attributed  the  acquisition  for  Milan  of  the relics  of  the  Three  Magi,  afterwards  by  Frederic Barbarossa  transported  to  Cologne.  He  held the  See  of  Milan  from  A.D.  315  to  A.D.  331. EUSTOSIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  10)  

See  SS.  DEMETRIUS  and  OTHERS. EUSTRATIUS, AUXENTIUS, EUGENE,  MARDARIUS  and  ORESTES  (SS.;  MM.  (Dec.  13) (4th  cent.)  Martyrs  under  Diocletian  (A.D. 302  about)  at  Sebaste  in  Armenia.  Eustratius was  burned  to  death  in  a  furnace ; Orestes roasted  on  a  gridiron  ;  the  others  done  to  death in  various  manners.  Their  relics  are  venerated in  Rome  in  the  Church  of  St.  Apollinaris. EUTHALIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Aug.  27)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Sicilian  maiden  who,  with  her mother,  was  converted  to  Christianity  by  the holy  martyr  Alpheus  and  his  fellow-sufferers. She  herself  gave  her  life  for  Christ,  being,  as tradition  has  it,  done  to  death  by  her  own brother.  She  was  probably  one  of  the  victims of  the  Decian  persecution  in  the  middle  of the  third  century.  It  is  right  to  mention  that the  Bollandists  consider  her  very  existence to  be  hardly  proved. EUTHYMIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  20)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Armenian  nobleman  of Melitene  who  becoming  a  priest  was  on  account of  his  conspicuous  virtues  and  talents  entrusted with  the  supervision  of  all  the  monasteries  of the  district.  From  love  of  solitude  he  secretly fled  to  Palestine,  lived  for  some  time  as  a  hermit in  a  cavern  near  the  Dead  Sea,  and  finally gathering  disciples,  founded  a  monastery  of  his own.  Though  he  consistently  shunned  the crowds  attracted  by  his  repute  for  sanctity  and miracles,  he  was  instrumental  in  securing many  conversions,  notably  that  of  the  Empress Eudoxia  from  Eutychianism,  and  in  procuring submission  in  the  East  to  the  Decrees  of  the Council  of  Chalcedon  (A.D.  451).  He  died A.D.  473  at  the  age  of  ninety-seven,  and  is among  the  most  highly  venerated  Saints  of  the Eastern  Church. EUTHYMIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (March  11)  
(9th  cent.)  A  fervent  monk  raised  to  the See  of  Sardis  in  Lydia,  who  courageously resisted  the  Iconoclasts  and  was  prominent  in the  Second  Council  of  Nice  (A.D.  787).  Banished by  the  Emperor  Nicephorus,  he  remained  in exile  till  his  death,  twenty-nine  years  later, though  recalled  at  intervals  and  offered  permission to  retain  his  See  on  condition  of  his tolerating  the  Iconoclast  heresy.  In  the  end he  was  scourged  to  death,  a.d.  840,  under  the 
EUTYCHIUS 

Emperor  Theophilus,  a  bigoted  Iconoclast,  who however  was  happily  reconciled  to  the  Church before  his  own  death  two  years  afterwards.  

EUTHYMIUS  (St.)  If.  (May  5)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  deacon  of  the  Church of  Alexandria  who  gave  his  life  for  Clirist,  but in  which  persecution  is  now  unknown.  

EUTHYMIUS  (St.)  (Aug.  29)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  Christian  who  with  his wife  and  child,  St.  Crescentius,  fled  to  Perugia during  the  persecution  of  Diocletian,  and  there crowned  a  troubled  life  by  a  saintly  death, early  in  the  fourth  century.  

EUTHYMIUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  24)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  sufferers  at  Nicomedia, the  Imperial  residence,  in  the  great  persecution under  Diocletian  (a.d.  303).  It  is  recorded  of St.  Euthymius  that  he  had  been  foremost  in encouraging  his  fellow-believers  bravely  to  lay down  their  lives  for  Christ.  

EUTROPIA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  15)  

See  SS.  LIBYA,  LEONIDES,  &c.  

EUTROPIA  (St.)  Widow.  (Sept.  15)  
(5th  cent.)  Of  this  Saint  mentioned  by Sidonius  Apollinaris  there  is  no  notice  in  the more  ancient  Martyrologies.  She  is  stated  to have  lived  in  Auvergne  (France)  some  time  in the  fifth  century.  

EUTROPIA  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  30)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  African  Martyr,  probably  of the  persecution  under  Valerian  (A.D.  253). No  trustworthy  account  of  her  is  extant.  

EUTROPIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Dec.  14)  

See  SS.  NICASIUS,  EUTROPIA, &c.  

EUTROPIUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  12)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Lector  or  Reader  of  the Church  of  Constantinople,  who  was  put  to death  with  St.  Tygrius  and  many  others  on account  of  their  loyalty  to  St.  John  Chrysostom after  that  great  Saint  had  been  driven  into exile.  St.  Eutropius  died  in  prison  from  the consequences  of  the  torture  to  which  he  had been  subjected  (A.D.  405).  

EUTROPIUS  (St.)  M.  (March  3)  

See  SS.  CLEONICUS,  EUTROPIUS, &c.  

EUTROPIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  30)  
(Date  uncertain.)  One  of  the  fellow-workers with  St.  Denis  of  Paris  in  the  Evangelisation  of Gaul,  and  the  first  Bishop  of  Saintes.  The tradition  is  that  he  sealed  his  Apostolate  with his  blood.  The  date  will  depend  upon  that  in the  first  or  third  century  at  which  is  fixed  the Apostolate  of  St.  Denis.  

EUTROPIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  27)  
(5th  cent.)  A  citizen  of  Marseilles  ordained deacon  by  St.  Eustachius.  He  succeeded St.  Justin  in  the  See  of  Orange  and  wrought many  miracles.  There  is  mention  of  him  in a.d.  463  and  in  a.d.  475  ;  but  other  dates  are wanting.  He  appears  in  his  lifetime  to  have enjoyed  a  great  reputation  in  France.  Sidonius Apollinaris  speaks  of  him  in  the  highest  and most  reverential  terms.  

EUTROPIUS,  ZOSIMA  and  BONOSA  (July  15) (SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Porto  near  Rome, probably  victims  of  the  persecution  under Aurelian  (a.d.  273  about),  though  some  antedate them  to  the  time  of  Septimius  Sevcrus (A.D.  193-211).  The  fifty  soldiers  commemorated as  Martyrs  in  the  Roman  Martyrology on  July  8  appear  to  have  been  converted  to  the Faith  while  witnessing  the  fortitude  of  SS. Eutropius,  Zosima  and  Bonosa  (a  brother  and his  two  sisters).  For  some  reason  the  name of  St.  Bonosa  has  remained  the  most  prominent of  the  three.

EUTYCHIANUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Dec.  8)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  native  of  Etruria  or  Tuscany, who  in  a.d.  275  succeeded  St.  Felix  I  in  the Chair  of  St.  Peter.  He  had  great  veneration for  the  remains  of  the  Martyrs,  and  is  said  to have  interred  several  hundreds  of  them  with his  own  hands.  He  appointed  or  revived  the now  obsolete  custom  of  blessing  grapes  and other  fruits  at  the  end  of  the  Canon  of  the Mass.  He  passed  away  in  the  reign  of  Probus or  soon  after  (a.d.  283,  perhaps) ;  but  there is  some  dispute  as  to  precise  dates.  The  marble slab  covering  his  tomb  in  the  Catacombs  of St.  Callistus  has  in  modern  times  been  brought to  light.  The  Church  honours  him  as  a Martyr.  

EUTYCHIUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  4)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of.  the  victims  in  Rome, it  would  appear,  of  the  persecution  under Diocletian  at  the  opening  of  the  fourth  century. From  the  inscription  composed  for  his  tomb  by Pope  St.  Damasus  we  learn  that  after  torture he  was  left  for  twelve  days  in  prison  without food,  and  in  the  end  thrown  down  into  a  well. His  relics  are  now  venerated  in  the  church  of San  Lorenzo  in  Damaso.  

EUTYCHIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  14) (8th  cent.)  Christians  very  many  in  number, put  to  death  for  the  Faith  in  Mesopotamia  by the  Mohammedans  after  their  conquest  of  the country.  The  year  usually  given  is  A.D.  741. The  many  miracles  wrought  by  invoking  the intercession  of  St.  Eutychius  have  made  him famous  in  the  East.  

EUTYCHIUS  of  ALEXANDRIA  and  (March  26) OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Orthodox  Christians  and  staunch supporters  of  St.  Athanasius,  who  under  the leadership  of  St.  Eutychius,  a  sub-deacon  of the  Church  of  Alexandria,  were  imprisoned and  tortured  for  their  Faith  in  the  Trinity by  the  Arian  intruded  Bishops.  From  St. Athanasius  we  learn  that  St.  Eutychius,  after being  scourged,  was  condemned  to  slavery  in the  mines,  but  perished  from  exhaustion  on the  road  thither  (A.D.  356).  

EUTYCHIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  15)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Martyr  of  unknown  date of  Ferentino  in  the  Roman  Campagna.  A vision  in  which  he  appeared  to  St.  Redemptus, Bishop  in  the  sixth  century  of  that  See,  is recounted  by  St.  Gregory  the  Great.  Assemani treats  exhaustively  of  St.  Eutychius  in  his work  on  the  local  Saints  of  Ferentinum.  

EUTYCHIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  21)  

See  SS.  TIMOTHY,  POLIUS,  &c.  

EUTYCHIUS  and  FLORENTIUS  (SS.)  (May  23) (6th  cent.)  Two  Umbrian  Saints  of  the sixth  century  who  successively  governed  a monastery  near  Norcia.  St.  Gregory  the  Great extols  their  sanctity  and  recounts  several miracles  worked  by  their  prayers.  

EUTYCHIUS  (St.)  (Aug.  24)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Phrygian,  disciple  of  St.  Paul, and  conjectured  to  have  been  the  young  man raised  from  the  dead  by  the  Apostle  at  Troas (Acts  xx.),  who  on  St.  Paul  leaving  the  East, attached  himself  to  St.  John  the  Evangelist, aiding  him  in  his  Apostolate  and  attending  him to  the  Isle  of  Patmos.  He  is  said  to  have himself  been  imprisoned  and  put  to  the  torture for  the  Faith,  but  to  have  lived  to  nearly  the end  of  the  first  century  and  to  have  died  a natural  death.

(4th  cent.) A  Spanish  Martyr  of  the  fourth century.  He suffered either at Merida or somewhere in the neighbourhood of Cadiz. Nothing  is  really  now  known  about  him. EUTYCHIUS  and  DOMITIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  28) (Date  unknown.) A  priest  with  his  deacon registered  in  the  Roman  Martyrology  as  having suffered  martyrdom  at  Ancyra  in  Galatia  (Asia Minor).  We  have  no  other  record  of  them. EUVERT  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  7)  

Otherwise  St.  EVORTIUS,  which  see. *EVAL  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  20)  
(6th  cent.) A  British  Bishop  in  Cornwall, at  the  end  of  the  sixth  century,  who  has  left a  place-name  in  that  county.  Nothing  certain is  known  about  him. EVAGRIUS  of  CONSTANTINOPLE  (St.)  (March  6) Bp.  

(4th cent.) When (A.D. 370) the See of 
Constantinople had been vacant for twenty 
years,  usurped  by  Arian  intruders,  the  Catholics 
seized  a  favourable  moment  and  elected  Evag
rius,  a  personage  otherwise  unknown  to  history.  

A  few  months  later  he  was  driven  out  by  the 
Emperor  Valens  and  died  in  exile.  His  merits 
were  such  as  to  entitle  him  in  the  opinion  of  his 
contemporaries  to  the  honour  of  canonisation.  

EVAGRIUS  and  BENIGNUS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  3)  
(Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  at  Tomi  on  the 
Black Sea.  Nothing has come down to us 
concerning  them,  save  the  insertion  of  their 
names  in  the  old  Martyrologies.

See  SS.  PRISCUS,  CRESCENS, &c. EVAGRIUS,  PRISCIAN  and  OTHERS  (Oct.  12) (SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.) Martyrs  of  uncertain  date, 
said  by  some  to  have  suffered  in  Rome  ; by 
others,  with  more  probability,  in  Syria.  

♦EVAN  (INAN)  (St.)  (Aug.  18)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Scottish  hermit  in  Ayrshire, 
to whom churches are dedicated, but the 
particulars  of  whose  life  have  been  lost.  

EVARISTUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  14)  

See  SS.  CARPONIUS.  EVARISTUS, &c.  

EVARISTUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Oct.  26)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Anacletus, 
or possibly  of St. Clement in the Chair  of 
St.  Peter. There  is  much  dispute  as  to  the 
precise date of his nine years'  Pontificate.  

Some  put  it  A.i>.  96  to  A.D.  108  ;  others  A.D.  103 
to  A.D.  112  ;  others  again,  A.D.  112  to  A.D.  121.  

He  appears  to  have  been  a  Greek  of  Antioch, 
and  on  the  side  of  his  father,  of  Jewish  descent.  

He  divided  the  City  of  Rome  into  parishes  and 
appointed  seven  deacons  to  attend  the  Pope, 
thus  originating  the  College  of  Cardinals. He 
is  honoured  liturgically  as  a  Martyr.

EVASIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Dec.  1)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  whom  at  the  present 
day we have no trustworthy account. The 
tradition  is  that  Pope  St.  Sylvester  consecrated 
him  first  Bishop  of  Asti  in  Piedmont,  that  he 
laboured  zealously  for  the  good  of  his  fiock, 
that  he  was  driven  from  his  See  by  the  Arian 
Emperor Constantius, and that with many 
others  he  was  put  to  the  sword  under  Julian 
the  Apostate,  a.d.  362,  at  a  place  later  called 
after  him  Casale  Sant' Evasale, now  simply 
EVASIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  2)  
(Date unknown.) Beyond the mention  of 
him in the Roman Martyrology, no record 
remains  of  this  Saint,  who  is  described  as  a 
Bishop  of  Brescia  in  Lombardy.  

EVELLIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  11)  
(1st cent.) A Councillor of the  Emperor 
Nero, whose conversion to Christianity was 
104 

brought  about  by  the  great  patience  and constancy  of  the  Christians  who  suffered  under his  eyes,  and  more  particularly  by  the  example of  the  Martyr  St.  Torpes.  St.  Evellius  was beheaded  at  Pisa  A.D.  66  or  67. EVENTIUS  of  SARAGOSSA  (St.)  M.  (April  16)

A  Prelate  of  great  zeal  and  sanctity  and  distinguished by  his  assiduity  and  confidence  in prayer.  While  visiting  the  town  of  Tongres he  was  set  upon  and  killed  by  robbers.  Many miracles  have  been  worked  at  his  shrine. — Another  saintly  Bishop  of  Cologne  of  the  same name  is  put  on  record  by  St.  Gregory  of  Tours as  having  been  renowned  for  the  working  of miracles  about  a  century  later. *EVERMAR  (St.)  M.

(Date  unknown.)  Christians  of  Syracuse  in Sicily,  registered  in  the  old  Martyrologies (but  without  date)  as  having  suffered  martyrdom. Evodius  and  Hermogenes  are  said  to have  been  brothers,  Callistus  (often  written Callista)  is  likewise  asserted  to  have  been brother  or  sister  to  them.  These  three  Saints also  appear  in  the  Martyrologies  on  Sept.  2. EVODIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (May  6)  
(1st  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Antioch, consecrated,  it  is  said,  by  St.  Peter  the  Apostle on  his  departure  thence  for  Rome.  By  some  of the  ancients  the  fact  that  at  Antioch  the disciples  vere  first  named  Christians  (Acts  xi. 26)  is  attributed  to  St.  Evodius.  Tradition makes  of  him  a  Martyr  (a.d.  67  about).  He was  followed  in  the  Sec  of  Antioch  by  the great  St.  Ignatius. EVODIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  2)

Born  at  Bayeux  (Northern France)  (A.D. 517),  he  had  a  brilliant  career at  the  Court  of  King  Childebert  I ; but  moved by a Divine impulse obtained  leave of the following  monarch,  Clotaire  I,  to  retire  to  a monastery  (his  wife  at  the  same  time  taking the  veil  in  a  convent).  He  lived  henceforth a  life  of  prayer  and  of  work  for  the  good  of  his neighbour  ;  and  himself  founded  many  religious houses.  He  passed  away  A.D.  596. EWALD  THE  DARK  and  EWALD  THE  FAIR (SS.)  (Oct.  3)  
(7th  cent.)  Two  of  the  missionary  priestmonks,  sent  by  St.  Egbert  with  St.  Willibrord from  England  to  evangelise  Germany.  Venerable Bede  relates  that  their  field  of  work  was "  Old  Saxony."  Their  Apostolate  appears  to have  been  very  short.  They  were  done  to  death by  the  Pagans,  probably  in  the  neighbourhood of  Dortmund  about  A.D.  695.  Ewald  the  Fair was  struck  down  by  a  sword  blow.  Ewald  the Dark,  the  more  prominent  of  the  two,  was fearfully  maltreated,  and  in  the  end  torn  to pieces.  King  Pepin  enshrined  their  relics  at Cologne. *EWE  (St.)  V.

(6th  cent.  B.C.)  One  of  the  Four  Greater Prophets  and  the  writer  of  a  canonical  Book  of Scripture.  The  tradition  is  that  he  was  put  to death,  while  in  captivity  in  Babylon  with  the rest  of  his  nation,  by  one  of  the  Jewish  Headmen who  had  turned  Pagan  (B.C.  525),  and  was buried  there  in  the  tomb  of  the  Patriarchs Sem  and  Arphaxad.

This  "  incomparable  man," as  St.  Cyprian  styles  him,  did  much  for  Ecclesiastical discipline,  repressed  the  rigorism  of certain  heretics  of  his  time,  and  called  to account  the  famous  Origcn.  He  beautified  the shrines  of  the  Roman  Martyrs,  and  was  himself one  of  the  victims  of  the  Decian  persecution (A.D.  250).  To  St.  Fabian  is  attributed  the Holy  Thursday  rite  of  Consecration  of  the Holy  Oils  ;  also  by  some  the  alleged  Baptism of  the  Emperor  Philip. FABIAN  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  31)

St.  Sophia,  with  whom  they  were  baptised. Their  mother  brought  them  up  carefully  as Christians  and  encouraged  them  during  the horrors  of  their  martyrdom  in  Rome  under Hadrian  early  in  the  second  century.  Many legends  have  grown  up  concerning  them,  but nothing  more  can  be  stated  with  any  certainty about  them  and  their  holy  mother.  St.  Sophia and  her  children  have  always  been  in  great veneration  both  in  the  East  and  in  the  West. SS.  Faith,  Hope  and  Charity  are  said  to  have been  put  to  death  at  the  ages  respectively  of twelve,  ten  and  nine  years.  

FAITH  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  6)  
(4th  cent.)  Born  at  Agen  in  the  South  of France  and  arrested  in  the  same  city  by  the notorious  Prefect  Dacian  under  the  Emperor Maximian  Herculeus.  She  was  burned  to death  a.d.  303.  A  number  of  bystanders (chief  among  whom  was  the  Martyr  St.  Caprasius)  inspired  by  her  example,  bravely  declared themselves  to  be  also  Christians,  and  were  on that  account  beheaded.  The  relics  of  St. Faith  were  enshrined  at  the  Abbey  of  Conque, but  a  portion  of  her  ashes  were  taken  to  Glastonbury. Hence  probably  her  place  in  the  Sarum Calendar  and  the  Dedication  to  her  of  certain English  churches.

(7th  cent.)  Of  a  noble  Burgundian  family, his  father,  Ageneric,  was  one  of  the  principal lords  at  the  Court  of  Theodebert  II.  His brother,  St.  Cagnoald,  a  monk  at.  Luxeuil,  and his  sister,  St.  Phara,  attained  like  him  to  the honours  of  the  Altar.  Separating  by  mutual consent  from  his  wife  (Blidechild,  afterwards a  nun),  St.  Faro  received  the  religious  tonsure and  became  Bishop  of  Meaux,  a  See  which  he retained  for  forty-six  years,  until  his  holy death  a.d.  672.  His  zeal  and  piety,  coupled with  the  gift  of  miracle-working,  drew  many holy  men  and  women  to  Meaux,  among  others St.  Fiacra.  

FAUSTA  and  EVILASIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  20)  
(4th cent.)  St. Fausta, a girl of about 
thirteen,  was  being  cruelly  tortured  by  order 
of  Evilasius,  a  heathen  magistrate,  when  the 
106 

latter,  seeing  the  constancy  of  the  child,  believed and  was  also  crowned  for  Christ. They  suffered at  Cyzicum  in  Pontus  under  Diocletian,  A.D. 305. FAUSTA  (St.)  Widow.  (Dec.  19)  
(3rd  cent.)  Famous  both  for  the  nobility of  her  birth  and  for  her  piety,  St.  Fausta, mother  of  St.  Anastasia,  died  in  Rome  towards the  end  of  the  third  century.  In  the  words  of her  daughter  she  was  "  a  pattern  of  goodness and  piety."  Baronius  maintains  the  authenticity of  the  Letter  of  St.  Anastasia,  in  which these  words  occur,  but  doubts  have  since  been raised  as  to  its  genuineness. FAUSTINIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  26)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Faustinian  is  said  to  have been  the  second  Bishop  of  Bologna  in  Italy. He  comforted  the  Christians  during  Diocletian's persecution,  and  later  was  a  zealous  champion of  the  Catholic  Faith  against  the  Arians.  There is  some  doubt  as  to  the  precise  date  of  his death,  which  took  place  early  in  the  fourth century. FAUSTINUS  and  JOVITA  (SS.)  MM. (Feb.  15)  
(2nd  cent.)  Two  brothers,  nobly  born,  and zealous  professors  of  the  Christian  Faith,  which they  boldly  preached  to  their  fellow-citizens of  Brescia  (Lombardy)  at  a  time  of  heathen fury  such  that  even  their  Bishop  had  sought concealment.  They  were  at  length  arrested by  the  authorities,  and  it  is  said  that  the Emperor  Hadrian  himself,  after  arguing  with them,  ordered  them  to  be  beheaded  (A.D.  121). The  City  of  Brescia  possesses  their  relics  and venerates  them  as  its  chief  Patrons. FAUSTINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Ursicinus in  the  See  of  Brescia  (Lombardy).  He  is  said to  have  compiled  the  Acts  of  his  collateral ancestors  SS.  Faustinus  and  Jovita.  He died  after  about  twenty  years  of  Episcopate, a.d.  381,  and  was  succeeded  by  St.  Philastrius. FAUSTINUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  17)  
(Date  unknown.)  All  particulars  of  these Saints  are  lost,  though  Baronius  has  inserted them  in  the  Martyrology  on  the  authority  of ancient  manuscripts  he  had  before  him.  They are  alleged  to  have  suffered  in  Rome  and  to have  been  fortyfive  in  number ;  but  it  is quaintly  added  :  "  The  very  names  of  fortyfour  of  them  are  now  known  to  none  save God." FAUSTINUS,  TIMOTHY  and  VENUSTUS  (May  22)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th cent.) These holy men suffered in 
Rome  perhaps  as  late  as  the  reign  of  Julian  the 
Apostate  (a.d. 360-363) ; but  no  particulars 
are  forthcoming.

Some  conjecture  that  this St.  Faustus  is  the  convert  made  at  the  end  of her  life  by  St.  Dafrosa,  mother  of  St.  Bibiana. Others  identify  him  and  his  fellow-sufferers with  the  Saints  Lucy  and  Twenty-two  others, commemorated  in  the  Roman  Martyrology  on June  25  (probably  a.d.  280).

FAUSTUS,  DIDIUS,  AMMONIUS,  PHILEAS, HESYCHIUS,  PACOMIUS,  THEODORE  and OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  26)  
(4th  cent.)  These  Martyrs  suffered  in  the persecution  raised  in  Egypt  by  the  Emperor Maximian  Galerius,  in  which  St.  Peter,  Patriarch of  Alexandria,  perished  (a.d.  311  about).  St. Faustus  was  a  priest  of  Alexandria ;  SS. Phileas,  Hesychius,  Pacomius  and  Theodore were  Egyptian  country  Bishops ;  and  with them  six  hundred  and  sixty  Christians  are  said to  have  given  their  lives  for  their  Faith. TEATHERSTON  (RICHARD)  (Bl.)  M.  (July  30)  

See  Bl.  RICHARD  FEATHERSTON. FEBRONIA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  25)  
(4th  cent.)  A  young  nun  in  her  twentieth year,  victim  of  the  persecution  under  Diocletian (a.d.  304),  who  bravely  sealed  her  Confession of  Christ  with  her  blood,  at  Sybapolis  in  Syria, according  to  the  Martyrologies  ;  but  really  at Nisibi  in  Assyria  (Mesopotamia)  as  modern research  has  shown.  In  their  fear  the  fifty sisters  in  her  community  had  fled  to  various hiding-places,  Fcbronia  alone  remaining  with her  Abbess  and  one  other  aged  nun,  when  the Imperial  officers  came  to  seize  them.  It appears  that  Febronia  only  was  put  to  death, and  it  is  from  the  pen  of  one  of  the  other  two that  we  have  the  particulars  of  the  ghastly tortures  to  which  she  was  subjected  before being  beheaded.
♦FECHIN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  20)  
(7th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Yathy  and founder  of  many  monasteries  in  Ireland.  He led  a  life  of  extraordinary  penance,  spending his  nights  after  the  manner  of  St.  Patrick, in  reciting  the  whole  Psalter.  He  is  honoured at  Fobhare  or  Foure  (West  Meath),  where  he governed  a  monastery. Ecclefechan  and  St. 

Vigean's, near Arbroath in Scotland, also perpetuate  his  memory. *FEDLEMID  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  9)

(3rd  cent.)  Ordained  priest  by  Pope  St. Eleutherius  and  consecrated  Bishop  of  Foligno, his  native  city,  by  Pope  St.  Victor,  he  governed that  See  till  a.d.  250,  when  the  Decian  persecution broke  out.  Though  then  in  his  ninetieth year,  St.  Felician  was  arrested  and  sent  to Rome,  but  died  at  Monte  Rotondo  on  his  way thither.  His  remains,  brought  back  to  Foligno, were  some  centuries  later  translated  to  Metz, where  many  miracles  have  been  worked  at  his shrine.  At  Minden  in  Westphalia,  whither some  of  his  relics  were  carried  in  the  tenth century,  a  Feast  in  his  honour  is  kept  on Oct.  20,  which  has  given  occasion  to  a  second insertion  of  his  name  in  the  Roman  Martyrology.

(2nd  cent.)  This  holy  widow,  distinguished above  all  the  Roman  Matrons  of  her  time  for her  piety  and  charity,  had  seven  sons,  together with  whom  she  was  arrested  and  tried  as  a Christian  before  the  Emperor  Antoninus  Pius in  Pome,  about  a.d.  165.  Having  encouraged her  children  to  sacrifice  their  lives  cheerfully for  Christ,  she,  her  spirit  of  Faith  overcoming the  natural  tenderness  of  her  mother's  heart, witnessed  the  sufferings  by  which  they  merited their  crowns  of  martyrdom.  She  followed them  five  months  later,  being  beheaded  as  a

PELICULA 
Christian,  Nov.  23,  A.D.  165.  She  has  since been  commemorated  throughout  the  Catholic Church  on  that  day.  The  Feast  of  her  seven martvred  sons  is  kept  on  July  10. FELICULA  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  14)  

See  SS.  VITALIS,  FELICULA, &c. FELICULA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  13)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Roman  Saint  of  the  Apostolic Age  and  fellow-sufferer  with  St.  Petronilla, after  whose  martyrdom  under  Domitian  she was  left  for  a  fortnight  in  her  prison  without food  or  drink.  The  charge  against  her  was her  refusal  to  marry  a  Pagan  and  to  sacrifice to  idols.  Utterly  wasted  though  she  was,  she was  tortured  on  the  rack  and  at  last  thrown into  a  ditch  to  die.  Her  body  was  recovered by  the  priest  St.  Nicomedes,  and  by  him secretly  interred  outside  the  walls  of  Rome (A.D.  90  about). FELINUS  and  GRATIANUS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  1)  
(3rd  cent.)  These  holy  men,  soldiers  in  the Imperial  army,  were  martyred  at  Perugia  in the  persecution  under  Decius  (A.D.  250).  Their relics  were  translated  to  Arona  near  Milan, A.D.  979. FELIX  and  JANUARIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  7)  
(Date unknown.)  Said to have suffered 
martyrdom  at  Heraclea,  a  name  common  to 
several  ancient  cities.  We  have  neither  dates 
nor  particulars  concerning  them.  

FELIX  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  9)  

See  SS.  EPICTETUS  and  FELIX. FELIX  of  NOLA  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Syrian  by  birth,  who  after serving  in  the  Imperial  army,  became  a  priest at  Nola  in  Southern  Italy,  and  was  chosen  to be  his  chief  adviser  by  the  Bishop  St.  Maximus. When  in  A.D.  250  the  persecution  under  Decius broke  out,  Felix  was  seized,  scourged  and thrown  into  prison ;  but  having  been  miraculously delivered  therefrom,  he  watched  over the  deathbed  of  the  Bishop,  and  devoted  himself to  the  service  of  the  rest  of  the  persecuted group  of  Christians.  Decius  having  perished and  the  Church  being  for  a  time  at  peace,  the Bishopric  of  Nola  was  offered  to  Felix,  which however,  he  refused,  preferring  to  occupy himself  as  before  in  assisting  the  prelate  chosen in  his  place.  The  ancients  are  loud  in  praise of  his  holiness  of  life  and  of  his  charity  to  all. He  died  in  peace  at  an  advanced  age,  A.D.  260, but  on  account  of  the  many  sufferings  he  had endured  for  Christ's  sake  has  always  been honoured  as  a  Martyr.  He  is  commemorated annually  on  Jan.  14  throughout  the  Catholic Church,  and  his  shrine  at  Nola,  where  many miracles  have  been  wrought  in  answer  to  prayers for  help  from  him,  is  a  famous  place  of  pilgrimage. St.  Paulinus  of  Nola  and  Venerable  Bede have  both  written  the  Life  of  St.  Felix,  and Pope  St.  Damasus  has  composed  verses  in  his honour.  

Another  St.  Felix,  a  Roman  priest,  whose  Feast is  also  marked  on  the  14th  of  January,  is  often confused  with  the  more  famous  Saint  of  Nola. FELIX  IV  (St.)  Pope.  (Jan.  30)  
(6th  cent.)  The  successor  of  Pope  St.  John  I (A.D.  526).  He  built  the  Roman  church  of SS.  Cosmas  and  Damian  and  consecrated  no fewer  than  thirty-nine  Bishops,  during  his  short Pontificate  of  four  years.  He  was  evidently an  able  statesman,  and  treated  successfully  the cause  of  his  people  with  the  Barbarians,  who  in his  time  had  overrun  Italy.  He  died  A.D.  530.

See  SS.  LUPICINUS  and  FELIX. FELIX,  SEMPRONIUS,  HIPPOLYTUS  and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  3)  
(Date  unknown.)  There  are  various  opinions as  to  the  place  where  these  Martyrs  suffered. Though  the  old  Registers  describe  them  as Africans,  and  probably  St.  Felix  was  of  the Roman  Province  there,  it  is  not  at  all  certain that  they  all  suffered  in  that  country.  Their Acts  are  no  longer  extant.

(7th  cent.)  The  twentieth  Bishop  of  Brescia in  Lombardy,  which  Diocese  he  governed during  over  forty  troublous  years.  He  strugeled  successfully  against  the  Arian  Bishop, intruded  into  his  See  by  Rotharius,  King  of the  Lombards,  and  energetically  opposed  the inroads  of  the  heresy,  then  making  its  last  great effort  against  the  Catholic  Faith.  He  was  a zealous  pastor,  and  built  and  endowed  several churches.  The  date  of  his  death,  about  the middle  of  the  seventh  century,  is  variously given. FELIX  III  (St.)  Pope.  (Feb.  25)  
(5th  cent.)  An  ancestor  of  St.  Gregory  the Great.  St.  Felix  succeeded  Pope  St.  Simplicius, A.D.  483,  and  fought  against  Monophytism  or Eutychianism,  which  heresy  denied  that  Christ had  the  nature  of  man  besides  that  of  God. He  deposed  Acacius,  Bishop  of  Constantinople, for  heresy  and  schism.  Before  his  death (A.D.  492)  he  held  a  Synod  to  decide  the  measures to  be  taken  with  those  who  had  apostatised during  the  Vandal  persecution.  He  is  by  many reputed  the  author  of  the  so-called  Sacramentarium  Leonianum. FELIX  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  26)

Of  these,  as  of  so  many holy  Confessors  of  Christ  in  the  early  ages  of the  Church,  no  record  has  remained,  save  the registering  of  their  names  in  the  various  ancient Martyrologies.  SS.  Felix,  <fec.  are  by  several authors  conjectured  to  have  suffered  in  Africa ; but  no  date  can  with  any  probability  be  assigned to  them. FELIX  (St.)  M.  (March  8)  

See  SS.  CYRIL,  ROGATUS,  &c. FELIX  of  DUNWICH  (St.)  Bp.  (March  8)  
(7th  cent.)  St.  Felix,  a  native  of  Burgundy, when  he  was  consecrated  Bishop,  was  destined to  the  work  of  the  Evangelisation  of  the  AngloSaxons.  St.  Honorius  of  Canterbury,  on  the arrival  of  St.  Felix  in  England,  advised  him to  betake  himself  to  East  Anglia  (Norfolk  and Suffolk),  where  the  pious  King  Sigebert  was seeking  the  conversion  of  his  still  heathen subjects.  There  he  laboured  with  such  success that  at  his  death  (A.D.  646)  practically  t  lie whole  country  had  become  Christian.  He  was buried  at  Dunwich  in  Suffolk,  which  town,  now swallowed  up  by  the  sea,  he  had  chosen  for  his See.  Several  centimes  later  his  relics  were translated  to  Ramsey  Abbey.

(5th  cent.)  Twenty-four  of  the  victims  of the  Arian  Hunneric,  King  of  the  Vandals, towards  the  close  of  the  fifth  century.  Of these  African  Saints  no  particulars  are  extant, though  St.  Bede  and  all  the  old  Martyrologies register  them  as  above. FELIX  of  TREVES  (St.)  Bp.  (March  2(3)  
(5th  cent.)  The  local  records  of  the  Church of  Treves  were  destroyed  by  the  Normans, who  pillaged  the  city  at  the  end  of  the  ninth century.  We  only  know  that  this  St.  Felix, the  second  Bishop  of  Treves  of  that  name, and  thirty-third  in  succession  from  the  foundation of  the  See,  was  consecrated by St. Martin of Tours  (A.D. 386) under the  Emperor or usurper  Maximus.  He  was  a  zealous  opponent of  the  strange  Priscillianist  heresy.  He  later resigned  his  See  and  retired  to  a  monastery he  had  built  in  honour  of  our  Lady  and  of  the Martyrs  of  the  Theban  Legion,  where  he  died after  a.d.  400.  There  is  much  controversy about  him,  and  especially  whether  or  not  some of  the  particulars  given  may  not  apply  to another  Felix,  also  of  Treves.

From  a humble  lodging  wherein  they  lived  a  life  of much  penance  they  evangelised  the  town, converting  many  to  Christianity.  In  the  end they  were  imprisoned,  and  after  cruel  torture put  to  death  for  the  Faith,  A.D.  212.  

FELIX  of  SEVILLE  (St.)  M.  (May  2)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  deacon  who  suffered for  Christ  at  a  date  and  under  circumstances of  which  we  have  no  longer  any  record.  In Seville  and  its  neighbourhood  he  is  held  in great  veneration.

FELIX  of  SPOLETO  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (May  18)  
(4th  cent.)  There  is  a  dispute  as  to  whether this  Saint  was  Bishop  of  Spoleto  or  of  the neighbouring  city  of  Spello  (Hispellum) ;  but all  agree  that  he  was  one  of  the  victims  of  the great  persecution  (A.D.  304  about)  under Diocletian  and  Maximian  Herculeus,  by  whose orders  he  was  beheaded  as  a  Christian  teacher. At  Spoleto  he  is  still  in  great  veneration. Baring  Gould  with  others  contend  that  he  was Bishop  not  of  Spoleto  in  Umbria,  but  of  Spalato in  Dalmatia.  

FELIX  of  CANTALICIO  (St.)  (May  18)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Saint  in  great  veneration  in Italy.  Born  about  A.D.  1513,  near  Rieti,  of poor  parents,  he  worked  in  his  youth  in  the fields,  and  at  the  age  of  thirty  entered  among the  Capuchins  as  a  lay-brother,  and  as  s\ich for  forty  years  begged  about  Rome.  His intimacy  with  St.  Philip  Neri,  and  how,  as  the greatest  of  earthly  blessings,  they  used  to  wish one  another  "  sufferings  for  Christ,"  is  proverbial. St.  Felix  was  also  much  valued  by St.  Charles  Borromeo.  His  characteristic seems  to  have  been  throughout  a  life  of  austere penance,  a  cheerful  piety,  whence  his  nickname Deo  gratias  "  ("  Thanks  be  to  God  ").  He died  in  Rome  in  great  joy  of  spirit,  May  18, 1587.  He  is  often  represented  carrying  a beggar's  wallet  inscribed  "  Deo  Gratias."

FELIX  I  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (May  30)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth.  He  succeeded St.  Dionysius,  A.D.  269,  in  the  Chair  of St.  Peter.  He  wrote  to  Maximus  of  Alexandria condemning  the  heresy  of  Paul  of  Samosata. A  fragment  of  this  letter  has  been  preserved. He  is  further  said  to  have  decreed  that  Mass  be always  celebrated  over  relics  of  Martyrs. St.  Felix  received  the  crown  of  martyrdom, A.D.  274,  under  Aurelian,  and  was  buried  on the  Aurelian  Way.  Some  historians  date  his Pontificate  from  a.d.  273  onlv  to  A.D.  275. 

FELIX  and  FORTUNATUS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  11) (3rd  cent.)  Two  brothers,  born  at  Vicenzp in  the  North  of  Italy,  and  done  to  death  aft the  infliction  of  fearful  torture  at  Aquileia. They  suffered  under  Diocletian  about  A.D.  296.

governed  ably  and  successfully  in  the  Diocese  of 
Nantes  for  about  thirty-three  years.  He  was

still more for his charity to the poor.  He 
assisted  at  the  French  Councils  of  his  time  and 
built  the  Cathedral  of  Nantes.  He  died  Jan.  8, 
A.D. 584.  His festival is kept  in July, the

(Date  unknown.)  A  Bishop  of  Verona venerated  from  ancient  times  as  a  Saint,  but of  whom  no  authentic  account  is  extant.  His relics  are  enshrined  in  one  of  the  churches  of Verona. FELIX  of  MANFREDONIA  (St.)  M.  (July  25)  

See  SS.  FLORENCE  and  FELIX.  

FELIX,  JUCUNDA  and  JULIA  (SS.)  MM.  (July  27)  
(Date  unknown.)  In  regard  to  these  Saints, 
an  error  appears  to  have  crept  into  the  Roman 
Martyrology,  which  assigns  them  to  Nola  in 
South Italy.  As to St. Felix, the  reference 
would  simply  be  to  the  date  of  the  consecration 
of  St.  Felix,  Bishop  of  Nola  (Nov.  15).  SS.  

Jucunda and Julia are in the older MSS.  

described as Martyrs of Nicomedia in Asia 
Minor.  Nothing  more  is  known  about  them.  

FELIX  of  CORDOVA  (St.)  M.  (July  27)  

See  SS.  GEORGE,  FELIX, &c. FELIX  II  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (July  29)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Felix,  Archdeacon  of  Rome, was  elected  Pope  A.D.  355,  when  Pope  Liberius was  sent  into  exile  by  the  Arian  Emperor Constantius,  but  on  the  return  of  Liberius, after  two  years  of  exile,  he  at  once  resigned  the 
109 

FELIX 
Pontificate  of  which  in  all  probability  he  had been  merely  the  Administrator.  The  Roman Martyrology  records  his  martyrdom  at  Cervetro (Cserae)  in  Tuscany,  probably  about  A.D.  360  ; but  it  is  the  opinion  of  some  authors  that  he lived  on  for  several  years  in  retirement  and died  a  peaceful  death.  The  Church  also commemorates  the  Finding  of  the  Body  of St.  Felix  with  those  of  other  Martyrs.  It  is especially  to  be  noted  that  from  the  outset  he has  always  been  regarded  as  a  Saint,  and  there are  no  real  grounds  for  setting  him  aside  as  a mere  Anti-Pope.  

FELIX  of  GERONA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  1)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Christian  who  suffered under  Maximian  Herculeus  and  the  merciless Prefect  Dacianus  (A.D.  303)  at  Gerona  in  the North  of  Spain.  He  was,  while  still  living, literally  cut  to  pieces  with  butchers'  knives. The  old  Christian  poet  Prudentius  has  written some  verses  in  his  honour.  

♦FELIX  (FEDLIMID)  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  9)  

Otherwise  St.  PHELIM,  which  see.  

FELIX  of  PORTO  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  

See  SS.  MARTIAL,  SATURNINUS, &c.  

FELIX  of  PISTOJA  (St.)  (Aug.  26)  
(9th  cent.)  The  traditions  of  Pistoja,  a  town in  Tuscany,  where  he  flourished  probably  in  the ninth  century,  present  him  to  us  as  a  hermit, remarkable  for  the  austerity  of  his  life,  and venerated  as  a  Saint  immediately  after  his holy  death.  His  cultus  was  revived  on  the discovery  of  his  shrine,  A.D.  1400 ;  but  his history  is  very  uncertain.  

FELIX  and  ADAUCTUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  30)  
(4th  cent.)  Christians  who  were  beheaded in  Rome  (A.D.  304),  in  the  last  great  persecution, and  who  are  liturgically  commemorated  in  the Universal  Church.  St.  Felix  was  a  priest. St.  Adauctus  (a  Christian  of  name  unknown, so  styled  because  he  was  unexpectedly  added (adauctus)  to  St.  Felix  in  the  latter's  glorious death  struggle  in  consequence  of  his  calling out  that  he  too  was  a  Christian)  is,  of  course, quite  other  than  the  St.  Adaucus  (Oct.  4)  of Gibbon's  gibe  (Decl.  and  Fall,  ch.  Xvi.).  

FELIX  and  ANOTHER  FELIX  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  10) See  SS.  NEMESIAN,  FELIX, &c. One  of  these  St.  Felix  appears  to  have  been a  Bishop.  

FELIX  and  REGULA  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  brother  and  sister  who  at  the time  of  the  famous  martyrdom  of  St.  Maurice and  his  companions  under  Maximian  Herculeus, took  refuge  in  Switzerland  ;  but  were  afterwards sought  out  and  cruelly  put  to  death  in  the neighbourhood  of  Zurich.  

FELIX  and  CONSTANTIA  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  19) (1st  cent.)  Martyrs  who  suffered  in  the very  beginnings  of  Christianity  in  the  time  of Nero  at  Nocera,  a  town  between  Naples  and Salerno,  where  their  relics  are  venerated  ;  but no  particulars  are  extant.  

FELIX  of  AUTUN  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  24)  

See  SS.  ANDOCHIUS,  THYRSUS, &c.  

FELIX  and  CYPRIAN  (SS.)  Bps.,  MM.  (Oct.  12) (5th  cent.)  The  leaders  of  a  multitude  of 4966  Catholic  Christians  in  Africa,  maltreated and  driven  out  to  starve  in  the  Sahara  Desert by  Hunneric,  the  persecuting  Arian  King  of the  Vandals,  a.d.  482.  Among  them  were  many little  children.  Their  contemporary,  Victor  of Utica,  has  left  us  a  touching  account  of  their sufferings.  

FELIX  (AFRICANUS),  AUDACTUS  (ADAUCTUS), JANUARIUS, FORTUNATUS, and SEPTIMUS (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  24) (4th cent.)  African Martyrs who suffered under  Diocletian,  a.d.  303.  Every  endeavour was  used  to  induce St. Felix  (a  Bishop)  to deliver up the Sacred Scriptures and other Christian  books,  the  destruction  of  which  was a  paramount  object  with  the  crafty  Emperor, but the Saint remained steadfast to death. Dragged  to  Rome,  he  with  the  others  was  put 
no 

to  the  sword  at  Venosa  (or  perhaps  Nola)  in the  South  of  Italy. There  is,  however,  much controversy  among  the  learned  as  to  the  names of  these  Martyrs  and  the  details  of  their  Passion. FELIX  and  EUSEBIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  5)  
(1st  cent.)  Christians  of  the  first  century, St.  Felix  being  a  priest  and  St.  Eusebius described  as  a  monk  or  Solitary.  They  are mentioned  in  the  Acts  of  St.  Csesareus  as having  been  concerned  in  the  burial  of  that HolyMartyr.  They  themselves  were  afterwards beheaded  in  the  first  years  of  the  second  century at  Terracina,  a  city  between  Rome  and  Naples. FELIX  of  THYNISSA  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  6)  
(Date  uncertain.)  An  African  Christian, who  in  one  of  the  early  persecutions,  having faithfully  confessed  Christ  before  the  Roman Judge  and  having  been  sentenced  to  be  beheaded, was  on  the  following  morning  found dead  in  his  prison,  as  was  related  by  St.  Augustine in  a  sermon  to  his  people  of  Hippona. The  Thynissa  where  St.  Felix  suffered  is  an  old town  near  Hippona  (Bona),  not  Tunis,  as  some have  thought. FELIX  of  FONDI  (St.)  (Nov.  6)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  Religious  of  a  monastery at  Fondi  in  Southern  Italy,  characterised  by St.  Gregory  the  Great  as  a  Saint  and  contemporary of  his  own  (late  in  the  sixth  century). Nothing  more  is  known  about  him. FELIX  of  NOLA  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Saint  from  his  youth  upward, who  became  Bishop  of  Nola,  near  Naples,  and is  by  many  asserted  to  have  been  the  first occupant  of  that  See.  With  thirty  others,  he gave  his  life  for  Christ  about  A.D.  287  in  the beginning  of  the  last  great  persecution  under the  Prefect  Marcianus. FELIX  of  VALOIS  (St.)  (Nov.  20)  
(13th  cent.)  St.  Felix  of  the  Royal  House  of Valois,  born  A.D.  1127,  after  having  for  some time  led  a  most  austere  life  as  a  hermit  in  a forest  near  Meaux,  became  with  St.  John  of Matha  the  Founder  of  the  Trinitarian  Order (still  existing),  of  which  the  scope  was  the great  work  of  charity  of  that  age,  the  freeing of  the  Christian  captives  held  in  slavery  by  the Moors  of  Spain  and  North  Africa.  Pope Innocent  III  confirmed  the  new  Institute, and  St.  Felix  li\Ted  to  see  as  many  as  six  hundred of  its  houses  begun.  He  died  at  Cerf-Froid, his  old  hermitage,  Nov.  4,  A.D.  1212,  having shortly  before  been  comforted  by  a  vision of  Our  Lady,  wearing  the  Trinitarian  habit. FELIX  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  28)  

See  SS.  VALERIAN,  URBAN, &c.  

FELIX  of  BOLOGNA  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  4)  
(5th cent.) The fifth Bishop of Bologna 
and previously a deacon of the Church of 
Milan  under St. Ambrose.  He  is  mentioned 
by  Paulinus  in  his  Life  of  that  Saint.  St.  Felix 
died  a.d.  429,  and  was  succeeded  by  St.  Petro
nius,  afterwards  Patron  Saint  of  Bologna.

See  Bl.  JOHN  FELTON.  

♦FEOCK  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  2)  
(Date uncertain.) An otherwise unknown 
Saint,  whose  name  is  perpetuated  by  a  church 
Dedication  in  Cornwall.  Possibly  she  was  an 
immigrant  from  Ireland.  Some  have  it  that 
Feock  is  only  a  variant  of  the  name  of  St.  

Fiacca, a Confessor, friend of St. Patrick.  

But  this  seems  hardly  likely.  Others  identify 
St.  Feock  with  St.  Vougas  of  Brittany.  

FERDINAND  (St.)  King.  (May  30)  
(13th cent.)  St. Ferdinand III, King of 
Castile and Leon, resembled in many ways 
his first cousin, St. Louis, King of France.  

A  brave  soldier,  he  won  back  from  the  Moors 
the  great  cities  of  Seville  and Cordova,  and 
gave  its  deathblow  to  their  rule  in  Spam.  He 
FIDHARLEUS 

was  dilieent  and  just  in  his  government,  and above  all  heedful  to  do  no  wrong  to  the  least of  his  subjects.  His  saying  when  refusing  to burden  them  with  an  exorbitant  war-tax characterises  him :  "  God  will  not  fail  me, and  I  fear  more  the  curse  of  one  poor  old  woman than  the  whole  army  of  the  Moors."  Austere in  his  piety,  the  time  at  his  disposal  he  devoted to  penance  and  to  religious  exercises,  frequently repeating  :  "  Lord,  Thou  knowest  that  I  desire Thy  Glory,  not  my  own."  The  idol  of  his people,  he  was  setting  out  on  a  campaign when  he  closed  a  glorious  reign  by  a  holy  death, passing  from  this  world  May  30,  A.D.  1252,  in the  fifty-third  year  of  his  age,  the  thirty-fifth of  his  reign  in  Castile  and  twenty-second  in Leon.  He  was  canonised  by  Clement  X, A.D.  1671.  

♦FEREDARIUS  (St.)  Abbot,  (May  18)  
(9th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  one  of  the successors  of  St.  Columba  at  Iona,  where  he became  Abbot,  A.D.  863.  From  fear  of  the Danes,  the  body  of  St.  Columba  was  in  his  time removed  to  Ireland  and  enshrined  side  by  side with  that  of  St.  Patrick.  

♦FERGNA  (St.)  Bp.  (March  2)  
(7th  cent.)  Surnamed  the  White,  a  kinsman and  disciple  of  St.  Columba.  He  died  Abbot  of Iona,  A.D.  637.  

♦FERGUS  (FERGUISIUS,  FERGUSTUS)  (St.)  

Bp.  (March  30)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Downpatrick  and greatly  venerated.  But  the  traditions  concerning him  are  vague  in  the  extreme,  and  he may  possibly  be  identical  with  St.  Fergus  of Scotland,  and  therefore  of  date  much  later  than that  given  by  Irish  tradition.  

♦FERGUS  (FERGUSTUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  18)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Bishop  in  Scotland  who signed  the  Acts  of  the  Roman  Council  of  A.D. 721,  describing  himself  as  a  Pict.  He  is  said to  have  been  previously  a  Bishop  in  Ireland. In  the  Aberdeen  Breviary  he  is  called  Fergustian.  

FERREOLUS  and  FERRUTIO  (SS.)  MM.  (June  16) (3rd  cent.)  St.  Ferreolus  (probably  a  Bishop) and  St.  Ferrutio,  a  deacon,  are  said  to  have been  brothers,  and  were  natives  of  Asia  Minor. They  were  sent  by  St.  Irenseus  of  Lyons  to evangelise  the  country  round  Besan^on  at  the same  time  as  he  despatched  SS.  Felix,  Fortunatus  and  Aquileius  on  a  similar  mission  to  Vienne. Their  work  was  crowned  with  like  success, and  they  too  came  to  the  same  glorious  end — a  cruel  death  at  the  hands  of  the  heathen persecutors  (a.d.  212,  about).  

FERREOLUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  18)  
(4th  cent.)  A  celebrated  Martyr  of  Vienne in  Gaul,  an  officer  in  the  Imperial  army,  who like  many  of  his  rank,  on  being  discovered  to be  a  Christian,  was  brought  to  trial  as  such in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian.  He  was scourged  and  in  the  end  beheaded,  A.D.  304, many  miraculous  circumstances  attending  his martyrdom.  

FERRUTIO  (St.)  M.  (June  16)  

See  SS.  FERREOLUS  and  FERRUTIO.  

FERRUTIUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  28)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Roman  soldier  stationed at  Mainz  in  Germany,  who  demanded  his discharge  from  the  army  rather  than  take part  in  idolatrous  worship.  He  was  arrested and  committed  to  prison,  where  he  died  of hunger  and  ill-treatment.  The  date  of  his death  is  much  contested.  Some  put  it  as  late as  the  fifth  century ;  but  the  beginning  of  the fourth  seems  more  likely.  In  the  eighth century  St.  Lullus  placed  his  body  in  a  suitable shrine.

♦FIACE  (FIECH)  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  12)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Irish  Bishop,  friend  and disciple  of  St.  Patrick,  author  of  the  still extant  Hymn  in  honour  of  his  master.  

♦FIACHAN  (FIANCHNE)  (St.)  (April  29)  
(7th  cent.)  A  native  of  Munster,  monk  at 
Lismore and disciple of St. Carthage the 
Younger, remarkable for his great spirit of 
obedience  and  sublime  scift  of  prayer.  

FIACRIUS  (FIACRE,  FIAKER,  FEFVRE)  (St.)  
(Aug.  30) (6th  cent.)  Claimed  by  both  the  Scots  and Irish  as  their  countryman,  he  crossed  to  Gaul early  in  the  sixth  century,  and  being  kindly received  by  St.  Faro,  Bishop  of  Meaux,  he thenceforth  lived  the  life  of  an  anchoret  in  a neighbouring  forest.  His  cell,  to  approach which,  however,  was  strictly  forbidden  to women,  soon  became  a  place  of  pilgrimage, and  in  life  as  after  death,  he  worked  many miracles.  He  is  especially  noted  for  his  charity and  helpfulness  to  the  poor.  He  passed  away about  A.i).  670.  As  Patron  of  gardeners,  he  is often  represented  carrying  a  shovel.  The Paris  cabs  took  the  name  of  "  fiacres  "  from having  been  started  from  a  house  with  a  statue of  this  Saint  over  the  door.  

FIBITIUS  (St.)  (Nov.  5)  
(6th  cent.) This  Saint  of  whom  no  particulars 
are  extant,  is  by  some  styled  Bishop  of  Treves, 
by  others  Abbot  of  a  monastery  in  that  city.  

He  flourished  about  A.D.  500.  

FIDELIS  (St.)  M.  (March  23)  
(Date  unknown.)  By  some  placed  in  the same  group  of  African  Martyrs  as  St.  Felix  and his  twenty  fellow-sufferers  (March  23) ;  but more  probably  of  another  date  and  place  in Africa.  Particulars  are  altogether  wanting.  

FIDELIS  of  SIGMARINGEN  (St.)  M.  (April  24) (17th  cent.)  Mark  Rey,  born  at  Sigmaringen (South  Germany)  in  a.d.  1577,  practising  as  a lawyer,  came  to  be  known  as  the  "  Advocate of  the  Poor."  In  A.D.  1612  he  embraced  the Religious  life  as  a  Capuchin,  and  quickly advanced  in  the  way  of  the  Saints.  The newly-founded  Roman  Congregation  of  the Propaganda  (which  honours  him  as  its  ProtoMartyr)  sent  him  as  a  missionary  to  the  Swiss Protestants  in  the  Grisons.  His  converts  were numerous  ;  but  in  the  end  he  was  stabbed  to death  by  the  fanatics  near  Gruch  (April  24, 1622).  His  shrine  is  at  Feldkirch,  but  his head  is  venerated  in  the  Cathedral  of  Chur (Choire).  

FIDELIS  of  EDESSA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  21)  

See  SS.  BASSA,  THEOGONUS,  &c.  

FIDELIS  of  COMO  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  soldier  who  suffered martyrdom  in  Lombardy  under  Maximian Herculeus  at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century. St.  Peter  Damian  has  composed  a  Hymn  in  his honour.  His  body  was  translated  by  St. Charles  Borromeo  to  Milan ;  but  some  of  his relics  are  venerated  at  Como.  

FIDELMIA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  11)  

See  SS.  ETHENEA  and  FIDELMIA.  (?)  

FIDENTIANUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  15)  

See  SS.  SECUNDUS,  FIDENTIANUS,  &c.  

FIDENTIUS  and  TERENTIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  27) (Date  unknown.)  Their  relics  were  discovered in  the  twelfth  century  and  are  honoured at  Todi  in  Central  Italy  ;  but  nothing is  really  known  concerning  them.  The  legend extant  is  quite  untrustworthy.  

FIDENTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  16)  
(2nd  cent.)  Some  make  him  a  simple Confessor ;  others  a  Martyr ;  others  with Baronius  a  Bishop.  Beyond  his  name  the records  of  Padua  (to  which  place  he  is  assigned by  tradition)  give  no  information  concerning him.  Most  references  point  to  his  having  lived in  the  second  century  of  our  era.  

♦FIDHARLEUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Oct.  1)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  the  second founder  of  Rathin  Abbey. He  died  A.D.  762.

ransomed  by St. Aventinus, an Abbot  near 
Troyes,  whom  eventually  he  succeeded  in  the 
government  of  his  monks.  He  died  some  time 
about  the  middle  of  the  sixth  century  after 
many  years  of  saintly  life.  

♦FIECH  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  12)  
(6th cent.) An Irish Bard baptised by 
St.  Patrick  and  appointed  by  him  Abbot  of  a

(5th  cent.)  SS.  Fingar  and  Piala,  brother and  sister,  according  to  tradition,  children  of an  Irish  king,  crossed  over  to  Cornwall,  but there  were  put  to  death  at  Hayle  near  Penzance by  a  Pagan  chief  in  hatred  of  the  Faith.

♦FINIAN  LOBHAIR  or  THE  LEPER (March  16)  
(St.)  Abbot.  

(7th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  the  School  of  St. Columba.  He  is  said  to  have  governed  as Abbot  the  monastery  of  Swords  ;  but  it  is  vain to  attempt  to  disentangle  the  traditions  concerning him.  From  the  circumstance  of  his having  suffered  from  some  sort  of  skin  disease he  acquired  his  surname,  "  The  Leper." *FINLUGH  (FINLAG)  (St.)  Abbot,  (Jan.  3)  
(6th  cent.)  A  brother  of  St.  Fintan,  who crossed  to  Scotland,  where  it  is  thought  he became  one  of  St.  Columba's  disciples.  Returning to  Ireland,  he  was  made  Abbot  of  a  monastery established  by  St.  Columba  in  County Derry. *FINNIAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  7)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  in  Munster,  as  a  child, St.  Finnian  was  gifted  with  prophecy  and wonderful  miraculous  powers.  He  became  a disciple  of  St.  Brendan,  and  at  his  wish  founded and  governed  a  monastery  at  Kinnithy,  of which  place  he  is  Patron.

(6th  cent.)  An  austere  Cenobite  of  Irish birth  who,  trained  in  the  School  of  Menevia  in Wales,  became  master  of  the  Irish  School  of Clonard,  where  St.  Columba  was  numbered among  his  three  thousand  disciples,  and  where he  earned  the  title  of  "  Master  of  the  Irish Saints."  He  is  recognised  as  the  Patron  Saint of  the  Diocese  of  Meath,  of  which  he  was Bishop. FINNIAN  of  LUCCA  (St.)  Bp.  (March  18)

(6th  cent.)  Doone  (Limerick),  which  honours St.  Fintan  as  its  Patron,  was  the  scene  of  most of  this  great  Saint's  labours  and  miracles. His  holy  well  is  still  venerated  there.  He  was a  disciple  of  St.  Comgall  at  Ben-Chor,  and  in  his later  life  appears  to  have  founded  one  or  more monasteries.

(6th  cent.)  A  sixth  century  Leinster  Saint, founder  of  the  monastery  of  Cluainedhech (Clonenagh)  in  Queen's  County,  famous  for  the gifts  of  prophecy  and  miracles,  and  for  the strict  discipline  in  which  he  brought  up  his disciples,  among  whom  is  said  to  have  been St.  Comgall  of  Ben-Chor. *FINTAN  (MUNNU)  (St.)  Abbot.

(9th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  and  missionary in  Switzerland  and  Germany,  famous  for  his sublime  prayer  and  spirit  of  penance.  He passed  the  last  years  of  his  life  as  a  Recluse in  an  island  in  the  River  Rhine,  and  is  still  in great  local  veneration.  He  is  said  to  have passed  away  A.D.  827. *FIONNCHU  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  28)  
(6th  cent.) The  successor  of  St.  Comgall  in the Abbey of Ben-Chor, remarkable for his extraordinary  spirit  of  penance. FIRMATUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  5)  

See  SS.  PLACIDUS  and  OTHERS. FIRMATUS  and  FLAVIANA  (SS.)  MM. (Oct.  5)  
(Date  unknown.)  St.  Firmatus.  a  deacon, and  St.  Flaviana,  a  virgin,  are  venerated  on Oct.  5  at  Auxerre  in  France ;  but  nothing whatever  is  known  of  them,  and  they  may  even be  two  of  the  companions  of  St.  Placidus, Martyr,  honoured  on  the  same  day,  and  some of  whose  relics  appear  to  have  been  brought  to France. FIRMINA  (St.)  V.M.  (Nov.  24)  
(4th  cent.) A  Christian  maiden  tortured  to 
death  at  Amelia  (Amerise)  in  Umbria (Italy)  

during  the  great  persecution  under  Diocletian 
(A.D.  303  about).  

FIRMINUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  11)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  two  Saints  of  this name  venerated  at  Amiens  in  the  North  of France,  to  which  place  Baronius  attributes the  memory  of  this  holy  Abbot,  were  both Bishops  honoured  respectively  on  Sept.  1  and Sept.  25.  There  are  traces  however  of  an Italian  St.  Firminus,  Abbot  in  the  Marches  of Ancona  in  the  eleventh  century. FIRMINUS  of  ARMENIA  (St.)  M.  (June  24)  

See  SS.  ORENTIUS,  HEROS,  &c. FIRMINUS  of  METZ  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  18)  
(5th  cent.)  The  statements  given  in  the usual  authorities  about  this  St.  Firminus  are very  contradictory.  He  seems  to  have  been the  twentieth  Bishop  of  Metz  (probably  an Italian,  though  some  say  a  Greek),  and  to  have zealously  governed  his  Diocese  for  about  eight vears,  dying  in  concept  of  high  sanctity,  A.D. 496. FIRMINUS  of  AMIENS  (St.)  Bp.,  M. (Sept.  25)  
(3rd  cent.)  Described  as  a  native  of  Navarre, baptised  by  St.  Saturninus,  Bishop  of  Toulouse, and  consecrated  Bishop  in  the  same  city.  He preached  the  Faith  on  his  journey  northwards through  Gaul,  finally  fixing  his  abode  at  Amiens, where  he  was  martyred  towards  the  end  of  the 
FLORENCE 

third  century,  under  Rictius  Varus,  Prefect  of the  Gauls.  He  was  succeeded  by  one  of  his disciples,  St.  Eulogius,  and  the  latter  by  a second  St.  Firminus,  likewise  held  in  great veneration  in  the  district.  

FIRMINUS  of  UZES  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  11)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  at  Narbonne  in  the  South of  France  and  educated  by  his  uncle  the  Bishop of  Uzes,  he  succeeded  the  latter  at  the  early age  of  twenty-two.  His  great  virtues,  as  was said,  supplied  for  his  want  of  years.  He assisted  at  several  Synods  and  occupied  a prominent  place  among  the  distinguished prelates  of  his  time,  until  his  early  death  at the  age  of  thirty-seven  (a.d.  553).

(3rd  cent.)  An  Eastern  Christian  who

been  scourged,  stoned  and  beheaded  towards 
the  close  of  the  third  century.

See  SS.  ORENTIUS,  HEROS, &c.  

FIRMUS  of  TAGASTE  (St.)  Bp.  (July  31)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Of  him  St.  Augustine writes  that  he  was  Firm  by  name  but  Firmer yet  by  Faith.  Put  to  the  torture  (probably  in the  third  century)  he  endured  the  most  frightful agonies  of  pain  rather  than  betray  the hiding-place  of  a  fellowChristian.  Baronius  in the  sixteenth  century  inserted  his  name  in  the Roman  Martyrology.  

FIRMUS  and  RUSTICUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  9)  
(3rd  cent.)  Two  relatives,  prominent  citizens of  Bergamo  in  Lombardy,  who  were  scourged and  beheaded  for  the  Christian  Faith  under  the Emperor  Maximinian  at  Verona  at  the  end of  the  third  century.  Their  relics  at  one  time transported  to  Africa,  were  brought  back  later to  Italy,  part  being  now  at  Bergamo,  part  at Verona.

(7th  cent.)  First  Bishop  and  Patron  of  the Diocese  of  Killaloe.  An  Irish  monk,  graced with  the  gift  of  working  miracles,  consecrated Bishop  by  Pope  John  IV.  Besides  missionary work  in  the  Hebrides  and  elsewhere  and  the care  of  his  Diocese,  he  was  so  given  to  prayer that  he  succeeded  in  reciting  daily  the  entire 
FLAVIA  DOMITILLA,  EUPHROSYNA  and 
THEODORA  (SS.)  VV.MM.  (May  7)  
(First  cent.)  Flavia  Domitilla,  a  great  niece of  the  Emperors  Domitian  and  Titus,  and  also of  the  famous  Christian  Senator  Flavius  Clemens, was  baptised  by  Pope  St.  Clement.  For refusing  to  marry  a  Pagan,  Domitian  banished her  to  the  Island  of  Pontia  (Ponza),  where  she succeeded  in  converting  her  foster  sisters, Theodora  and  Euphrosyna.  All  three  were burned  to  death  at  Terracina  in  the  reign  of Trajan  (a.d.  98-a.d.  117).  Their  relics  were brought  to  Rome  and  enshrined  in  the  Basilica, built  in  honour  of  St.  Domitilla's  martyred servants,  Nereus  and  Achilleus. FLAVIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  5)  

See  SS.  PLAC1DUS,  &c. FLAVIAN  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  28)  
(4th  cent.) A  Prefect  (or  perhaps  DeputyPrefect) of Rome under the Emperor Diocletian. He  was  converted  to  Christianity  by beholding  a miraculous apparition of  Angels hovering over the heads of the Martyr St. Secunda  (Jan.  29).  All  of  his  household  soon followed  his  example, and  all  suffered  death together for their Faith, at Civita Vecchia, about  a.d.  300. FLAVIAN  of  CONSTANTINOPLE  (St.)  (Feb.  18) Bp.  M. (5th cent.) The brave Prelate who suc

ceeded  St.  Proclus  at  Constantinople.  In a.d.  447  he  enraged  Chrysaphius,  favourite  of the  Emperor  Theodosius,  by  refusing  him  the customary  bribe  on  his  accession  to  the  See, and  much  more  by  strenuously  denouncing  the heresy  of  Eutyches,  the  favourite's  kinsman. St.  Flavian  was  by  the  intrigues  and  violence of  the  followers  of  the  latter  maltreated  and banished  at  the  false  Council  of  Ephesus (A.D.  449),  dying  a  short  time  later  of  the ill-usage  he  had  received.  The  Emperor Martian  with  the  Empress  St.  Pulcheria  caused his  relics  to  be  brought  back  solemnly  to Constantinople,  and  the  Fathers  of  Chalcedon formally  proclaimed  his  sanctitv  (a.d.  451).

See  SS.  MONTANTJS,  LUCIUS,  &c. FLAVIAN  and  ELIAS  (SS.)  Bps.  (July  4)  
(6th  cent.)  St.  Flavian,  Patriarch  of  Antioch,  and  St.  Elias,  Patriarch  of  Jerusalem, were  exiled  by  the  Emperor  Anastasius  (a.d. 491  to  A.d.  518)  for  strenuously  upholding  the Decrees  of  the  Council  of  Chalcedon,  affirming the  existence  of  the  Two  Natures  in  Jesus Christ,  that  is,  the  Nature  of  God  and  the Nature  of  Man.  St.  Flavian  died  at  Petra  in Arabia  (a.d.  512),  and  St.  Elias  at  Aila  on  the shores  of  the  Red  Sea  (a.d.  513). FLAVIAN  (FLAVIUS,  FLAVINIAN)  of  AUTUN 
(St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  23)  
(7th  cent.)  The  authors  of  the  Gallia Christiana  place  him  twenty-first  in  the  number of  Bishops  who  ruled  over  the  illustrious  See of  Autun  in  France.  He  lived,  it  is  generally believed,  in  the  first  half  of  the  seventh  century. FLAVIAN  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  22)  
(4th  cent.)  Alleged  to  have  been  an  ExPrefect  of  Rome,  branded  as  a  slave  on  account of  his  being  a  Christian,  by  order  of  Julian  the Apostate,  and  banished  to  an  obscure  village in  Tuscany,  where  he  died  while  engaged  in prayer,  a.d.  362.  St.  Flavian  is  mentioned  in some  versions  of  the  Acts  of  St.  Bibiana,  on which,  however,  little  reliance  can  be  placed. FLAVIANA  of  AUXERRE  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  5)  

See  SS.  FIRMATUS  and  FLAVIANA. FLAVIUS,  AUGUSTINE  and  AUGUSTUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (May  7)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Flavius,  a  Bishop  of  Nicomedia,  suffered  martyrdom  there  with  his  two brothers,  Augustine  and  Augustus,  under  the tyrant  Diocletian,  early  in  the  fourth  century ; but  in  what  precise  year  is  unknown. FLAVIUS  CLEMENS  (St.)  M.  (June  22)  
(1st  century.)  He  was  a  brother  of  the Emperor  Vespasian  and  uncle  of  Titus  and Domitian,  whose  niece  Flavia  Domitilla  the Elder  he  married.  In  the  year  95  he  held  the consular  dignity.  Domitian  had  him  arrested and  condemned  him  to  be  beheaded  on  the charge  and  crime  of  being  a  follower  of  Christianity (A.D.  96). FLAVIUS  of  AUTON  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  23)

the  Emperor  Maximinian  the  Thracian  (A.D. 235)  at  Furcona,  an  ancient  town  near  Aquila in  Southern  Italy.  They  appear  to  have belonged  to  the  troop  or  regiment  of  which  the martyrdom  of  eighty-three  Christians  is  commemorated on  July  24  ;  but  why  these  two  are registered  separately  is  not  known.  

FLORENCE  (St.)  (Sept,  22)  
(5th  cent.)  A  priest  who  lived  in  Poitou (France)  in  the  fifth  century,  or  perhaps  much later.  History  is  silent  concerning  him. Legend  leads  him  to  Lyons,  thence  to  Tours, and  on  to  the  Glonna  Mountain  in  Aquitaine, where  he  built  a  monastery  and  died  at  the  age (it  is  said)  of  one  hundred  and  twenty-three years.

(4th  cent.) A  Martyr  at  Thessalonica,  where, 
after  enduring  terrible  tortures,  he  died  at  the 
stake, under the Emperor Maximin Daza 
(A.D.  312).  

FLORENCE  of  ORANGE  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  17)  
(6th  cent.)  The  eighth  Bishop  of  Orange, a  town  in  Southern  France,  famous  for  the Ecclesiastical  Councils  held  there  in  early times.  Coming  between  SS.  Verus  and  Vindemialis,  he  died  about  A.D.  526,  illustrious  for his  manifold  graces  and  miracles.  

FLORENCE  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  27)  
(3rd  cent.) All  that  is  known  of  this  Martyr 
is  that  he  died  for  our  Holy  Faith  in  the  third 
century,  at  a  place  now  called  Trois-Chateaux 
in  Burgundy.  

FLORENCE  of  STRASSBURG  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  7) (7th  cent.)  An  Irishman  by  birth,  he  left his  country  for  Alsace  and  settled  in  the  wilds of  Haselac,  where  he  built  a  monastery.  On his  being  made  Bishop  of  Strassburg,  he  founded another  (St.  Thomas's),  chiefly  for  his  own countrymen.  After  an  Episcopate  of  eight years,  he  passed  away  A.D.  687,  and  was  buried in  his  monastery  church  of  St.  Thomas.

The  scion  of  an  illustrious, possibly  Gothic,  family,  and  the  only  sister  of the  holy  Bishops,  Leander,  Fulgentius  and Isidore  of  Seville.  St.  Florence  was  born  at Carthagena  in  Spain,  and  losing  her  parents  at an  early  age  was  placed  under  the  guardianship of  St.  Leander.  She  retired  into  a  convent, for  which,  on  her  being  elected  Abbess,  St. Leander  wrote  a  Rule.  She  probably  outlived her  brothers,  the  last  of  whom,  St. Isidore,  died  A.D.  636.  

FLORENTINUS  and  HILARY  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  27) (Date  uncertain.)  The  learned  are  not  agreed as  to  who  these  Saints  were.  Semont,  near Autun  in  France,  seems  the  more  likely  conjecture as  to  their  place  of  martyrdom,  rather than  Sion  in  the  Valais.  Some  date  it  A.D.  406, at  the  time  of  the  Vandal  invasion  of  Gaul ; others  A.D.  265  in  the  raid  of  the  Alamanni under  Chrocus.  There  is  a  consent  that  their tongues  were  torn  out  previous  to  their  being beheaded.

(St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Severinus in  the  See  of  Treves  early  in  the  fourth  century. By  some  he  is  said  to  have  been  put  to  death for  the  Faith.  But  there  is  much  controversy both  as  to  him  and  as  to  his  reputed  predecessor St.  Severinus.  

FLORENTIUS  of  VIENNE  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Jan.  3) (3rd  cent.)  An  early  Bishop  of  Vienne  in Gaul,  eminent  for  holiness  of  life  and  for learning.  He  was  banished,  and  later  put  to death  on  account  of  his  being  a  Christian, about  A.D.  253. 114 

FLORENTIUS  (St.)  (Feb.  23)  
(5th  cent.) A  Saint  much  venerated  in  Seville 
and  its  neighbourhood.  Some  have  described 
him  as  a  Martyr,  which  however  is  unlikely.  

He  died  A.D.  485.

Heraclius  being  Emperor  of  the  East,  Jerusalem was  taken  by  the  followers  of  Mahomet,  A.D. 637 ;  and  it  was  about  that  time  that  St. Florian  and  his  fellow-sufferers  perished.

All  four were  put  to  death  (drowned  in  a  well)  for  the Faith  ;  but  the  date  of  their  Passion  is  disputed, most  authors  assigning  it  to  the  second century,  but  others  to  as  late  as  the  fourth. *FLORUS  of  LODEVE  (St.)  Bp.

rendered  to  him  is  known.

(10th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who,  after spending  many  years  in  the  practice  of  great virtue,  as  is  said,  ruled  for  some  time  the Diocese  of  Armagh.  Later,  St.  Forannan, with  some  companions,  migrated  to  Wasor  in Belgium,  and  there  became  Abbot  of  a  monastery which  received  many  privileges  from  the Holy  See. *FORDE  (THOMAS)  (Bl.)

(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  early  converts  made 
by  St.  Patrick  in  Ireland,  the  son  of  a  chieftain 
of  Trim.  He  devoted  himself  to  the  service 
of  the Apostle and  is  said  from feelings  of 
humility to have refused to be consecrated 
Bishop.  His  story  is  mixed  up  with  that  of 
St. Loman, and  modern  critics are inclined 
to  post-date  the  two  Saints  to  a  later  century.

(6th  cent.)  A  holy  man  whose  sanctity  is extolled  by  St.  Gregory  the  Great,  and  whom he  describes  as  having  had  great  power  for  the casting  out  of  devils.  He  governed  the  Diocese of  Todi  in  Central  Italy  for  nine  years,  dying a.d.  537.

FORTY  ARMENIAN  MARTYRS  (SS.)  (March  9) (4th  cent.)  Forty  Christian  soldiers  put  to death  by  the  Emperor  Licinius  at  Sebaste  in Armenia,  a.d.  320,  at  the  close  of  the  great persecution.  They  were  exposed  naked  on  the ice  of  a  frozen  lake,  a  warm  bath  being  placed on  the  bank  as  a  temptation  to  apostatise. One  fell,  but  his  place  was  taken  by  one  of  the guards,  converted  to  Christianity  by  witnessing the  courage  of  the  rest.  On  the  morrow  all were  dead,  save  the  youngest  among  them. His  brave  mother  carried  her  child  after  the corpses  of  the  rest  until  he  too  expired  in  her arms,  and  then  laid  his  body  by  their  side.

FOUR  CROWNED  MARTYRS  (SS.)  (Nov.  8)  
(4th  cent.)  Four  Christians  (whose  names  at first  unknown,  were  later  discovered  to  be Severus,  Severianus,  Carpophorus  and  Victorinus),  scourged  to  death  in  Rome  under Diocletian  (a.d.  303).  With  their  relics  were enshrined  those  of  five  other  Martyrs  who appear  to  have  suffered  in  the  same  persecution, probably  in  Pannonia  (Hungary).  These, Claudius,  Nicostratus,  Castor  and  Simplician, by  name,  were  sculptors,  or  perhaps  metalworkers. They  had  laid  down  their  lives rather  than  work  at  the  making  of  idols  intended to  be  placed  in  a  Pagan  temple.  

♦FRAGAN  and  GWEN  (BLANCHE)  (SS.)  (July  5) (5th  cent.)  Refugees  from  Britain  in  the troubles  consequent  upon  the  departure  of  the Romans  and  parents  of  SS.  Wenwaloe,  Jacut and  Guithern.  Churches  in  Brittany  are dedicated  to  each  of  them.  

FRANCES  (FRANCISCA)  (St.)  Widow.  (March  9) (15th  cent.)  The  Foundress  of  the  Oblates of  Tor  dei  Specchi  in  Rome.  St.  Frances  was born  A.D.  1384,  and  married  Lorenzo  Ponziani, A.d.  1396.  Favoured  by  God  with  a  high  gift of  absorbing  prayer,  she  nevertheless  acted  on her  own  axiom  :  "A  wife  is  bound  to  leave  her devotions  at  the  Altar  and  to  find  God  in her  household  work." A  model  to  the  Roman

FRANCIS 
matrons  of  her  time,  she  did  much  to  correct their  luxurious  and  idle  manner  of  life.  She faithfully  stood  by  her  husband  in  bis  troubles and  exile ;  but  after  his  death  (a.d.  1436), joined  as  a  humble  member  of  the  community, the  Institute  of  the  Oblates,  which  she  herself had  founded.  The  remaining  four  years  of her  life  she  passed  among  the  Sisters  in  severe penance  and  fervent  exercises  of  piety.  She was  favoured  with  continual  visions  of  Angels, and  only  intermitted  her  prayer  to  work  for  the poor  of  Rome.  Veneration  of  her  became general  from  the  date  of  her  death  (March  9, a.d.  1440),  but  she  was  not  formally  canonised till  A.D.  1608.  Her  shrine  in  the  Olivetan Church  of  St.  Maria  Novella  is  one  of  the  most frequented  in  Rome.  

FRANCIS of SALES (St.) Bp.,  (Jan.  29)  

Doctor  of  the  Church. (17th  cent.)  A  Saint  who,  in  the  words  of St.  Paul,  made  himself  "  all  things  to  all  men," and  whose  characteristic  virtues  were  unflagging zeal  tempered  by  unconquerable  gentleness. He  is  best  studied  in  his  own  writings,  especially in  his  "  Introduction  to  a  Devout  Life,"  and  in his  "  Treatise  on  the  Love  of  God."  Born a.d.  1546  of  noble  parents  near  Annecy  in Savoy,  he  studied  at  Paris  and  at  Padua,  and having  entered  the  Ecclesiastical  state,  was made  coadjutor  to  the  Bishop  of  Geneva. In  Savoy  he  distinguished  himself  by  his wonderful  Apostolate  of  the  Calvinists  of  the Chablais,  in  which  district  he  made  within two  years  over  eight  thousand  converts.  On the  death  of  the  Bishop  he  succeeded  to  the See  of  Geneva,  and  was  consecrated  A.d.  1602 ; but  repeatedly  refused  a  Cardinalate.  He preached  constantly  in  his  own  Diocese  and elsewhere,  and  always  with  great  gain  of  souls to  God.  Together  with  St.  Jane  Frances  he founded  the  Order  of  the  Visitation.  Having put  his  Diocese  thoroughly  in  order,  he,  at  the request  of  the  Duke  of  Savoy  (a.d.  1612), repaired  to  the  Court  of  Louis  XIII  of  France, intent  on  bringing  about  a  good  understanding between  the  Sovereigns,  and  on  Dec.  28  of  the same  year  calmly  expired  at  Lyons.  His remains  were  taken  to  Annecy  and  laid  in  the Church  of  the  Visitation.  He  was  canonised A.D.  1665,  and  declared  Doctor  of  the  Church nearly  two  hundred  years  later  by  Pope  Pius  IX.  

♦FRANCIS  CLET  (Bl.)  M.  (Feb.  17)  
(19th  cent.)  A  French  missionary  priest  of the  Congregation  of  the  Mission  (Vincentians or  Lazarists),  who  after  thirty  years  of  labouring in  China,  was  cruelly  put  to  death  when  quite an  old  man  by  the  Pagan  Chinese,  a.d.  1820.  

FRANCIS  of  PAULA  (St.)  (April  2)  
(16th  cent.)  St.  Francis,  born  in  Calabria  of poor  parents  (a.d.  1416),  retired  at  the  age  of fourteen  to  a  solitary  cave  on  the  seashore, and  was  joined  by  two  other  pious  youths. Seventeen  years  later  his  followers  had  become so  numerous  that  it  was  found  necessary  to build  for  them  a  large  church  and  convent. They  fasted  all  the  year  round,  and  led  a  life of  continual  prayer.  In  its  beginnings  the Rule  (approved  A.D.  1474)  allowed  for  only one  priest  in  each  convent.  The  Brethren styled  themselves  "  Minims  "  (Least),  looking upon  theirs  as  the  lowest  of  Religious  Orders. It  quickly  developed,  spreading  over  Italy  and France.  To  the  latter  country  St.  Francis himself  was  sent  at  the  request  of  King  Louis XI,  at  whose  penitent  deathbed  he  assisted. Kings  Charles  VIII  and  Louis  XII  insisted  on the  Saint's  remaining  near  them,  and  he  died in  France  (a.d.  1508),  at  the  age  of  ninety-two. He  was  canonised  eleven  years  later.  His relics  were  destroyed  by  the  Huguenots  later in  the  same  century.  

FRANCIS  of  JEROME  (St.)  (May  11)  
(18th  cent.) Born  near  Taranto  in  Southern 
Italy, A.D. 1642, he led from childhood a 
blameless and useful life.  Ordained priest 
116 

a.d.  1666,  he  entered  the  Society  of  Jesus. He  was  one  of  the  most  eloquent  preachers  of his  time,  and  by  word  and  example  converted innumerable  sinners.  The  City  of  Naples  was the  chief  scene  of  his  labours  for  God.  He  had a  great  devotion  to  St.  Cyrus  the  Martyr,  with whose  relics  he  performed  many  miracles. He  died  on  the  day  he  had  predicted,  A.D.  1716. His  relics  are  in  the  Jesuit  church  at  Naples. He  was  canonised  A.D.  1839. FRANCIS  CARACCIOLO  (St.)  (June  4)  
(17th  cent.)  St.  Francis  (Ascanius)  of  the illustrious  Caracciolo  family,  was  born  near Naples  A.D.  1563.  When  at  the  age  of  twentytwo  thought  to  be  dying  of  a  terrible  skindisease,  he  vowed,  should  he  recover,  to  devote his  life  to  God  and  his  neighbour,  in  the  Ecclesiastical state.  Ordained  priest,  he  set  about his  work  in  company  with  two  other  devout clerics.  After  an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  begin it  in  Spain,  he  founded  his  Order  (that  of  the Lesser  Regular  Clerks)  in  Italy,  where,  favoured by  the  Holy  See,  it  speedily  prospered.  St. Francis's  own  life  was  one  of  uninterrupted prayer  and  penance.  He  died  while  engaged in  Mission  work  in  a  town  of  the  Abruzzi,  A.D. 1608,  whence  his  body  was  brought  back  to Naples,  where  it  is  now  venerated.  He  was canonised  two  hundred  years  later  by  Pope Pius  VII.  St.  Francis  is  represented  holding in  his  hand  a  Monstrance,  the  Perpetual  Adoration of  the  Blessed  Sacrament  being  a  special devotion  in  his  Institute.
♦FRANCIS  PACECHO  and  OTHERS (June  20)  
(Bl.)  MM.  

(17th  cent.) Jesuit  Martyrs at Nangagski 
in  Japan,  among  whom  were  six  native  cate
chists.  Five other Japanese Christians (one 
of  them  a  child)  suffered  with  them,  A.D.  1626.  

FRANCIS  SOLANO  (St.)  (July  24)  
(17th  cent.)  Born  in  Andalusia  in  Spain, A.D.  1549,  and  professed  (a.d.  1569)  in  the Order  of  St.  Francis,  this  holy  friar  practised assiduously  every  virtue,  and  by  his  zealous preaching  converted  many  from  a  life  of  sin. A  pestilence  having  broken  out  at  Granada, he  braved  all  dangers  and  gave  overwhelming proof  of  the  unbounded  charity  which  animated him.  In  the  year  1589  he  was  sent  to  Peru. There  and  elsewhere  in  South  America  he worked  assiduously  during  the  last  twenty years  of  his  life,  dying  at  Lima,  a.d.  1610. He  had  the  spirit  of  prophecy  and  wrought many  miracles.  He  was  canonised  A.D.  1726, and  is  much  venerated  in  both  North  and South  America. FRANCIS  of  ASSISI  (St.)  (Oct.  4)  
(13th  cent.)  St.  Francis,  Founder  of  the great  Order  of  Friars  Minor,  styled  "  the  poor man  of  Assisi,"  was  born  in  that  town  (Central Italy)  a.d.  1182.  In  consequence  of  his lavishing  his  substance  on  the  starving  poor of  the  neighbourhood,  his  father,  a  rich  merchant, insisted  on  his  renouncing  all  right  to his  inheritance.  This  with  great  joy  of  spirit he  solemnly  and  publicly  did,  in  presence  of the  Bishop  of  Assisi.  Thenceforth  he  gave himself  up  utterly  to  the  service  of  the  poor, living  a  life  poorer  even  than  theirs.  Disciples flocked  to  him  at  his  little  chapel  called  the Portiuncula,  so  that  when  the  new  Order celebrated  its  General  Chapter  in  A.D.  1219, five  thousand  Friars  attended  it.  The  practice of  poverty  was  the  great  characteristic  of  the Begging  Friars,  for  not  only  individually,  but collectively,  they  refused  to  own  anything  at all.  Their  Rule  was  approved  by  Pope  Innocent III.  and  again  by  his  successor,  Honorius III.  The  Saint  himself  to  the  day  of  his  death went  about  doing  good,  journeying  even  into Palestine  and  Egypt.  It  was  in  the  year  1224, on  the  desolate  Mount  Alvernia,  that  St.  Francis received  the  Stigmata,  or  Impression  on  his flesh  of  Our  Lord's  Five  Sacred  Wounds,  in memory  of  which  event  the  Church  has  instituted 
FROILAN 

a  special  festival.  St.  Francis  died  at  Assisi a.d.  1226,  and  was  canonised  two  years  later. His  relics  were  officially  examined  and  reenshrined  in  the  nineteenth  century.  The famous  annual  Portiuncula  Indulgence  and  the widespread  Third  Order  of  St.  Francis  are proofs  of  the  enthusiastic  following  the  "  poor man  of  Assisi "  has  to  this  day  among  both clergy  and  laity.  

FRANCIS  BORGIA  (St.)  (Oct.  10)  
(16th  cent.)  Born  A.d.  1510,  a  son  of  the Duke  of  Gandia  and  a  Grandee  of  Spain,  at  the age  of  eighteen,  he  was  placed  at  the  Court  of the  Emperor  Charles  V  ;  and  soon  after  married the  virtuous  Eleonora  de  Castro,  by  whom  he had  five  children.  In  A.D.  1539,  his  having to  escort  the  disfigured  corpse  of  the  Empress Isabel  to  its  last  resting-place  so  impressed  him that  he  vowed  to  become  a  Religions,  and  four years  later  resigned  his  Vice-Royalty  of  Catalonia to  enter  the  Society  of  Jesus  (a.d.  1551). After  years  given  to  study  and  prayer,  chiefly spent  in  Rome,  he  steadily  refused  the Cardinalate  pressed  upon  him  by  the  Pope and  by  the  Emperor,  devoting  himself  to preaching.  He  was  made  the  third  General of  his  Order,  which  he  did  much  to  consolidate and  propagate.  He  died  at  Ferrara,  while travelling  on  an  Embassy  from  Pope  St.  Pius  V to  the  Kings  of  France  and  Spain  (a.d.  1572) ; and  his  remains  were  enshrined  at  Madrid. He  was  canonised  a.d.  1671.  

FRANCIS  XAVIER  (St.)  (Dec.  3)  
(16th  cent.)  St.  Francis  Xavier,  born  a.d. 1506  at  Pamplona  in  Navarre,  studied  with distinction  at  Paris,  where  he  met  St.  Ignatius, and  joining  him  was  one  of  those  who  with  the holy  Founder  of  the  Society  of  Jesus  offered their  lives  to  God  at  Montmartre  (a.d.  1534). In  obedience  to  his  Superior  he  undertook  the Apostolate  of  the  Indies,  landing  at  Goa, a.d.  1542.  His  first  work  was  the  bringing back  to  the  leading  of  a  Christian  life  of  the European  population  of  that  city.  Thenceforward, he  gave  himself  up  to  the  heathen. He  journeyed  through  India,  reaching  Malacca, preaching  and  working  miracles,  and  even raising  the  dead  to  life.  Innumerable  conversions followed.  In  Japan,  whither  he  next repaired,  so  marvellous  was  his  Apostolate  that it  is  reckoned  that  forty  years  afterwards  there were  no  less  than  four  hundred  thousand Christians  in  the  islands.  He  died  A.D.  1552, when  attempting  to  penetrate  into  China,  on the  Island  of  Sancian,  near  Macao.  His  body, brought  back  to  Goa  was,  a  century  later, found  to  be  incorrupt.  Many  miracles  were wrought  at  his  tomb,  and  he  was  canonised a.d.  1662.  He  has  since  been  declared  Patron of  Catholic  Missions.  

FRATERNUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.  29)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Auxerre  in  France, who  succeeded  (possibly  after  some  interval) the  famous  St.  Germanus  in  the  latter  half  of the  fifth  century.  The  tradition  is  that  he  was martyred  by  the  Barbarians,  then  overrunning Gaul,  on  the  very  day  of  his  consecration.  But there  are  grave  doubts  as  to  the  proof  of  this alleged  coincidence.  

♦FREDERICK  (St.)  Bp.  (May  27)  
(12th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Liege,  distinguished for  his  zeal  in  repressing  simony,  and  for  the support  he  gave  to  the  Church  in  her  resistance to  the  usurpations  of  the  German  Emperors. After  many  sufferings  in  the  Cause  of  God  he passed  away,  A.d.  1172.  

FREDERICK  (FREDERICUS)  (St.)  M.  (July  18) (9th  cent.)  The  grandson  of  Radbod,  King of  the  Frisians  and  from  his  youth  trained  up in  piety.  In  the  year  820,  chosen  Bishop  of Utrecht,  he  worked  zealously  to  extirpate idolatry  from  Friesland.  He  reproved  with Apostolic  freedom  Judith,  the  second  wife  of Louis  the  Debonnaire,  and  also  the  incestuous inhabitants of Walcheren, thereby d; rawing 

upon  himself  their  enmity.  After  saying  Mass he  was  stabbed  to  death  in  the  Chanel  of  St. John  the  Baptist  (July  18,  a.d.  838),  some say  by  the  order  of  Judith,  others  by  assassins hired  "by  the  inhabitants  of  Walcheren.  

♦FREMUND  (St.)  M.  (May  11)  
(9th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  Hermit,  possibly of  the  Royal  Family  of  Mercia,  who  seems to  have  been  done  to  death  by  the  Danish invaders  of  England,  and  to  have  thenceforward been  honoured  as  a  Martyr.  His  remains  were enshrined  at  Dunstable.  

♦FRICOR  (ADRIAN)  (St.)  (April  1)  

See  SS.  CADOC  and  FRICOR.  

FRIDESWIDE  (FRIDESWINDA)  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  19) (8th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  Didan,  Prince (Subregulus)  of  Oxford.  From  her  childhood she  took  for  her  maxim  :  "  Whatsoever  is  not God  is  nothing."  On  the  death  of  her  mother, Saprida,  she  assumed  the  Religious  habit,  and afterwards  received  the  charge  of  the  monastery of  St.  Mary  at  Oxford,  built  by  her  father. It  is  related  of  her  that  she  was  delivered  by prayer  from  the  criminal  importunities  of  Algar, a  Mercian  Prince.  St.  Frideswide  died  before the  end  of  the  eighth  century,  and  came  to  be honoured  as  the  Patroness  of  the  city  and Universitv  of  Oxford.  

♦FRIDIGAND  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  17)

It  is  reported  that  while  at Poitiers  he  pointed  out  the  till  then  unknown tomb  of  St.  Hilary.  He  probably  flourished in  the  seventh  century,  but  there  is  much controversy  on  the  subject.

Travelling  in Italy  to  improve  himself  in  Ecclesiastical learning,  on  the  death  of  Geminian,  Bishop  of Lucca,  he  was  chosen  to  succeed  him.  He worked  many  miracles,  and  St.  Gregory  the Great  said  that  by  his  prayers  the  impetuous flood  of  the  River  Anser  (Serchio)  was  stopped. He  died  A.D.  578  (or,  as  some  say,  A.D.  589) ; and  was  buried  near  Lucca,  where  a  church now  stands  bearing  his  name,  and  where  his festival  is  kept  on  Nov.  18,  the  anniversary of  one  of  the  translations  of  his  relics  (either that  of  a.d.  782  or  that  of  A.D.  1152).

♦FRODOBERT  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  8)  
(7th  cent.)  A  humble  monk  of  Luxeuil, distinguished  for  his  simple-mindedness,  who at  length  coming  to  be  appreciated  by  his contemporaries,  succeeded  in  founding  a monastery  of  his  own  near  Troyes,  to  which  his fame  of  sanctity  attracted  numerous  disciples.

FRONTO  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  14)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Solitary  who  with  his  disciples retired  into  the  Desert  of  Nitria  in  Egypt. He  died,  it  is  said,  towards  the  close  of  the second  century  of  our  era,  a  notable  fact,  as showing  the  Sub-Apostolic  origin  of  the  Cenobitic  life.

(SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  21)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Fructuosus,  Bishop  of Tarragona,  then  the  capital  of  Spain,  was, during  the  persecution  of  Valerian  and  Gallienus,  called  upon  to  worship  the  gods.  He replied  that  he  worshipped  none  save  the One  True  God,  which  same  profession  of  Faith was  made  by  his  deacons,  Augurius  and  Eulogius.  The  Martyrs  were  then  fastened  to wooden  stakes  and  burned  alive.  When  the fire  had  burned  through  their  bonds  they extended  their  arms  in  the  form  of  a  cross and  thus  expired  (A.D.  259).  St.  Augustine has  left  us  a  Panegyric  on  St.  Fructuosus.  

FRUCTUOSUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  16)  
(7th  cent.)  This  renowned  Spanish  Saint was  a  prince  of  the  Royal  blood  of  the  Visigoth kings,  who  on  the  death  of  his  parents  left  the world  which  it  had  been  long  his  desire  to  do, and,  after  first  seeking  instruction  from  the Bishop  of  Palentia,  sold  his  patrimony  and gave  the  greater  part  of  the  proceeds  to  the poor.  With  the  remainder  he  built  several monasteries,  one  especially  at  Complutum  or Alcala,  which  grew  into  the  great  Abbey  of Complutum.  He  was  chosen  Abbot,  but  after a  time  resigned  his  charge  and  sought  the wilderness.  At  length  he  was  recalled  to  be Bishop  of  Dunium,  and  A.D.  656  was  appointed Archbishop  of  Braga.  He  died  A.D.  665,  having according  to  his  own  request  been  laid  upon ashes  before  the  Altar.

♦FULCRAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  13)  
(11th  cent.)  A  zealous  Bishop  of  Lodeve, who  ruled  his  Church  for  over  half  a  century. He  was  remarkable  for  the  severity  of  the penitential  austerities  he  imposed  upon  himself. He  died  A.D.  1006.  

FRUMENTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  27)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  youth  of  the  fourth century  who  making  a  voyage  with  his  uncle, Meropeus  of  Tyre,  was  cast  on  the  shore  of Abyssinia.  All  on  board  were  massacred  by the  savage  inhabitants  with  the  exception  of himself  and  his  brother.  The  King  having taken  a  fancy  to  him,  he  was  educated  at  the Court,  and  in  time  became  the  Treasurer  of the  kingdom.  On  the  death  of  the  monarch he  was  entrusted  with  the  education  of  the Royal  Princes,  Aizan  and  Sazan.  Wishing  for the  conversion  of  the  kingdom,  Frumentius asked  the  assistance  of  St.  Athanasius,  who gave  him  Holy  Orders  and  Episcopal  Consecration and  sent  him  back  to  Abyssinia,  which he  converted  to  Christianity  with  its  King  Aizan, thus  meriting  the  title  of  Apostle  of  Ethiopia. The  precise  year  of  his  death  is  unknown.

♦FUGATIUS  and  DAMIAN  (SS.)  (Jan.  3)  
(2nd  cent.)  These,  otherwise  written  Phaganus  and  Derivianus,  are  the  names  given  in the  Roman  Breviary  to  the  missionaries  sent to  Britain  at  the  request  of  King  Lucius  by Pope  St.  Eleutherius.  They  must  have  exercised their  Apostolate  chiefly  in  South  Wales, where  churches  are  dedicated  in  their  honour. Glastonbury  Abbey  laid  claim  to  the  possession of  their  Sacred  Relics.  

FULGENTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  1)  
(6th  cent.)  A  descendant  of  a  noble  senatorial family  of  Carthage.  Though  already appointed  Procurator  of  that  Province,  at  an early  age  he  left  the  world  and  entered  a monastery,  from  which  six  years  later  he  was driven  out  by  the  Arian  heretics.  He  then repaired  to  Egypt,  but  finding  that  country in  schism,  set  out  for  Rome.  Thence,  during the  first  lull  in  the  persecution,  he  sought  again his  cell  in  Africa.  Elected  Bishop  of  Ruspa (A.D.  50S)  he,  with  fifty-nine  others,  was banished  by  the  Arian  King  Tlirasimund to  Sardinia.  Though  the  youngest  of  the exiles,  he  was  their  mouthpiece  ;  and  by  books and  letters  still  extant  confounded  the  Pelagian and  Arian  teachers  and  confirmed  the  Catholics of  Africa  and  Gaul  in  their  Faith.  On  Thrasimund's  death  the  exiled  Bishops  returned  to Africa  and  Fulgentius,  after  re-establishing discipline  in  his  Diocese,  retired  to  a  monastery in  the  Island  of  Arcinia  to  prepare  himself  for death,  passing  away  a  year  later,  A.D.  533. He  has  left  us  several  valuable  Theological Treatises.  

FULK  (St.)  (May  22)  
(7th  cent.)  One  of  the  band  of  saintly English  or  British  pilgrims  who,  under  the leadership  of  St.  Ardwine,  probably  about A.D.  600,  journeyed  to  Italy.  St.  Fulk  gave  his life  in  the  service  of  the  plague-stricken  at Santopadre  or  Castrofurli  near  Arpino  in  the South  of  Italy,  and  is  venerated  as  the  Patron Saint  of  the  district.  But  the  traditions  concerning these  holy  men  are  very  obscure.  

FULK  (FOULQUES)  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct,  26)  
(13th  cent.)  Born  at  Piacenza  of  Scottish parents  (a.d.  1164),  he  was  given  a  Canonry. Then,  having  studied  at  Paris,  he  became Archpriest  and  Bishop  of  Piacenza.  Six  years later  he  was  by  Honorius  III  translated  to Pavia,  which  Diocese  he  governed  for  thirteen years,  dying  a.d.  1229,  in  odour  of  high  sanctity.

Driven  out  of  England  by  King  Pen  da  of Mercia,  he  repaired  to  France,  and  through  the generosity  of  Clovis  II  built  the  great  monastery of  Lagny,  six  leagues  from  Paris.  At one  period  St.  Fursey  was  deputed  by  the Bishop  of  Paris  to  govern  his  Diocese  in  quality of  Vicar.  He  died  a.d.  650,  at  Froheins  in  the Diocese  of  Amiens,  and  was  buried  at  Peronne.  

FUSCA  and  MAURA  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Christian  virgin  Fusca converted  her  nurse  Maura,  and  they  were  both baptised  by  St.  Ermolaus.  As  Fusca  courageously resisted  the  entreaties  of  her  parents  to induce  her  to  apostatise,  her  father  resolved  to put  her  to  death  ;  but  his  design  was  frustrated. Later,  during  the  Decian  persecution  (a.d.  250), the  Judge  Quintillianus  had  her  and  St.  Maura tortured  and  executed  at  Ravenna,  her  birthplace. Her  Relics  were  taken  to  Africa,  but have  since  been  brought  back  to  Italy  and  are venerated  in  one  of  the  islets  near  Venire.  

FUSCIAN,  VICTORIOUS  and  GENTIAN  (Dec.  11) (SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  Fuscian  and  Victorious  were  two Apostolic  men  who  according  to  one  account preached  the  Gospel  in  Gaul  with  St.  Denis  of 
GALLICANUS 

Paris.  However  that  may  be,  they  made Terouanne  (St.  Omer)  the  seat  of  their  mission. At  Amiens,  where  Bictius  Varus  was  persecuting the  Christians,  they  lodged  with  one  Gentian, who  was  desirous  of  embracing  the  Faith  of Christ.  Soon  after,  they  were  arrested  with their  charitable  host,  and  all  three  died  for Christ  about  a.d.  287.  Their  bodies  now  lie in  the  Cathedral  of  Amiens,  whither  they  were translated  by  St.  Honoratus.

His  festival  is  not  as  yet  universal  in  the Latin  Church,  though  it  is  so  among  the  Greeks. GABRIEL  OF  THE  SEVEN  DOLOURS 
(St.)  (May  31)  
(19th cent.)  A Passionist Brother who,

self-denial  and  humility  and  by  a  consuming 
devotion  to  Our  Lord's  Passion,  to  a  high  degree 
of sanctity.  He died a.d. 1862, and was

GALDINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  18)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  at  Milan  of  a  very  noble family,  St.  Galdinus  was  well-educated,  and after  ordination  made  Chancellor  and  Archdeacon of  Milan.  In  a.d.  1162  the  Emperor Frederic  Barbarossa  took  that  city,  and  all  but razed  it  to  the  ground.  Soon  after  this  event Galdinus,  though  absent,  was  made  Archbishop. He  encouraged  the  Milanese  to  rebuild  their city,  and  had  the  consolation  of  ministering successfully  to  the  wants  of  the  people  both spiritually  and  temporally.  On  the  last  day of  his  life,  although  unable  to  say  Mass,  he mounted  the  pulpit  and  having  preached  a memorable  sermon,  calmly  expired  (a.d.  1176). GALGANUS  (St.)  (Dec.  3)

Both  St.  Columban and  St.  Gall  were  banished  by  King  Theodoric, and  St.  Gall,  settling  near  Lake  Constance  in Switzerland,  converted  to  Christianity  the people  of  that  territory.  He  was  chosen  Abbot of  Luxeuil,  A.D.  625,  but  would  not  accept  the dignity,  preferring  his  poor  cell  in  Switzerland. He  died  A.D.  646.

The  tradition  is  that  Gamaliel  was converted  to  Christianity  even  before  St.  Paul, and  that  he  buried  St.  Stephen  in  his  own estate,  he  himself  with  St.  Nicodemus  sharing afterwards  the  tomb  with  the  Proto-Martyr.

VV.MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  St.  Gaudentia,  a  Roman maiden, is  said  to  have  suffered  with  three other  Christians  in  one  of  the  early  persecutions  ; but  the  more  ancient  Martyrologies  do  not  rank her  among  the  Martyrs.  All  dates  and  particulars concerning  her  have  been  lost. GAUDENTIUS  of  NOVARA  (St.)  Bp. (Jan.  22) (5th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Ivrea  near  Turin, who,  driven  from  that  city,  took  refuge  with St.  Laurence,  Bishop of Novara.  Having attended  St.  Eusebius  of  Vercelli  dining  the latter's banishment, brought about by the Arians, St. Gaudentius  became  the  successor of St. Laurence. In his twenty years of Episcopate,  he  converted  many  sinners,  built several  churches  and  reformed  his  clergy.  He passed  away  about  a.d.  418. GAUDENTIUS  of  VERONA  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  12) (5th cent.) A holy Bishop of Verona in North  Italy,  who  flourished  in  the  middle  of the  fifth  century,  and  who  appears  to  have 120 

attended  Pope  St.  Hilary's  Council  of  Rome (a.d.  465),  but  about  whom  no  particulars  are extant.  His  relics  are  venerated  at  Verona in  the  ancient  Basilica  of  St.  Stephen.  

GAUDENTIUS  and  CULMATIUS  (SS.) (June  19) MM.  

(4th  cent.)  St.  Gaudentius,  a  Bishop,  and St.  Culmatius,  his  deacon,  are  stated  by  the Roman  Martyrology  to  have  been  murdered by  Pagans  at  Arezzo  in  Tuscany  in  the  time of  the  Emperor  Valentinian  I  (a.d.  364). With  them  suffered  Andrew,  a  layman  with his  wife  and  children,  and  other  Cliristians to  the  number  of  fifty-three.  

GAUDENTIUS  of  RIMINI  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  14) (4th  cent.)  An  Asiatic  born  at  Ephesus,  who came  to  Rome  about  A.D.  308,  and  embraced the  Ecclesiastical  state.  He  was  ordained priest  a.d.  332.  Fourteen  years  later  he became  Bishop  of  Rimini,  and  suffered  with the  other  Catholic  prelates  from  the  Arians, who  dominated  the  famous  Council  of  a.d.  357. In  fine,  he  was  done  to  death  by  these  enemies of  the  Faith  (a.d.  359  or  A.D.  360).  

GAUDENTIUS  of  BRESCIA  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  25) (5th  cent.)  Educated  by  St.  Philastrius, Bishop  of  Brescia,  whom  he  styles  his  father, St.  Gaudentius  entered  a  monastery  in  Csesarea of  Cappadocia,  in  order  to  shun  the  honours and  applause  of  the  world.  He  early  distinguished himself  for  piety  and  learning.  On the  death  of  Philastrius,  as  the  people  of Brescia  sought  Gaudentius  for  their  Bishop and  would  have  no  other,  he  was  forced  to return  home  under  pain  of  excommunication, and  was  consecrated  Bishop  of  Brescia,  a.d.  387. His  people  showed  themselves  devoted  to  him, and  he  obtained  great  gain  of  souls  by  his sermons,  some  of  which  are  still  extant.  In A.d.  405,  sent  to  the  East  to  defend  the  cause of  St.  Chrysostom,  he  was  imprisoned  in Thrace.  He  died  a.d.  420  or  shortly  after.  

GAUDIOSUS  of  BRESCIA  (St.)  Bp.  (March  7) (5th  cent.)  The  thirteenth  or  fifteenth Bishop  of  Brescia  in  Lombardy,  where  his relics  are  venerated.  The  particulars  of  his life  are  lost,  and  even  the  century  in  which  he flourished  is  uncertain.  But  a.d.  445  is  often given  as  the  year  of  his  holy  death.  

GAUDIOSUS  of  SALERNO  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  26)  
(7th  cent.)  A  holy  Bishop  who  appears  to have  occupied  the  See  of  Salerno  near  Naples in  the  middle  of  the  seventh  century,  and whose  relics  are  now  venerated  at  Naples. The  particulars  of  his  life  are  lost.  

GAUDIOSUS  THE  AFRICAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  28) (5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Abitina,  one  among those  banished  by  the  Arian  Vandal,  King Genseric,  a.d.  440.  He  took  refuge  at  Naples, where  he  built  a  monastery  and  crowned  a zealous  life  by  a  holy  death  soon  after  the middle  of  the  century.  The  ancient  mosaic inscription  on  his  tomb  lauding  his  virtues, was  still  legible  in  the  time  of  Baronius  (end  of sixteenth  century).  

GAUGERICUS  (GAU,  GERY)  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  11) (7th  cent.)  Born  in  the  Diocese  of  Treves,  he was  ordained  priest  by  the  Bishop  of  that  city, and  later  made  fourth  Bishop  of  Cambrai, which  See  he  ruled  with  great  gain  of  souls for  thirty-nine  years,  dying  A.D.  622.

♦GELASINUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  26)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  comedian  at  Heliopolis  in Phenicia,  who,  having  to  mimic  the  ceremony  of Christian  Baptism  as  an  incident  in  a  play  on the  public  stage,  was  miraculously  converted to  Christianity,  declared  aloud  his  belief,  and was  thereupon  stoned  to  death  by  the  mob

(A.D.  297).  There  are  other  examples  (the best  known  being  those  of  St.  Genesius  and St.  Telemachus  of  Rome)  of  the  same  strange way  of  coming  to  Christ.  Butler  quotes  the historian  Theodoret  on  the  matter. GELASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  4)  

See  SS.  AQUILINUS,  GEMINUS,  Ac. *GELASIUS  (GIOUA-MAC-LIAG)  (March  27)  
(St.;  Bp.  

(12th  cent.)  An  Abbot  of  the  Columbian monastery  of  Derry.  He  was  consecrated Archbishop  of  Armagh,  A.D.  1137.  With  St. Malachy  O'Morghair,  he  held  a  Synod  in  the church  of  Holin  Patrick,  at  which  fifteen Bishops  and  two  hundred  priests  were  present. He  was  the  first  Irish  Bishop  privileged  to wear  the  Pallium.  In  A.d.  1162  he  consecrated St.  Laurence  O'Toole,  Archbishop  of  Dublin. He  died  March  27,  A.D.  1174. GELASIUS  (St.)  Pope.  (Nov.  21)  
(5th  cent.)  Roman-born  but  of  African  descent, St.  Gelasius  succeeded  St.  Felix  III  in the  Chair  of  St.  Peter  (A.D.  492).  He  corrected and  in  the  end  converted  Euphemius,  Bishop  of Constantinople,  a  favourer  of  the  Eutychian heretics  and  vigorously  asserted  the  rights of  the  Holy  See.  He  abolished  the  heathen festival  of  the  Lupercalia,  and  otherwise repressed  evil  living.  He  was  a  very  learned man,  and  the  Roman  Liturgy  owes  much to  him.  The  famous  Sacramentary  which goes  under  his  name  contains  much  that  is really  due  to  his  talent  and  research ;  and he  may  be  said  to  have  finally  fixed  the  Canon or  Order  of  Books  of  Holy  Scripture.  He repressed  the  Manichaeans  by  compelling  the laity  to  receive  Holy  Communion  under  both kinds,  made  other  useful  disciplinary  laws, and  has  left  us  valuable  writings.  He  died Nov.  21,  A.D.  496. GELASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  23)

(4th  cent.)

(7th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Clermont  in  Auvergne,  the  master  and  predecessor  of  St.  Prix. St.  Genesius  (locally  known  as  St.  Genes)  was a  prelate  of  austere  piety  and  wholly  devoted to  his  flock.  He  died  about  a.d.  662  in  the seventh  year  of  his  Episcopate.  

GENESIUS  of  ARLES  St.)  M.  (Aug.  25)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Notary  of  Aries  in  Southern Gaul,  who,  having  refused  to  put  on  record the  Imperial  Edicts  of  persecution,  and  declared that  he  himself  believed  in  Christ,  was  seized and  beheaded  under  Maximian  Herculeus  in  the beginning  of  the  fourth  century,  thus  receiving the  Baptism,  not  of  water,  but  of  blood.  

GENESIUS  of  ROME  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  25)

(5th  cent.)  Born  at  Nanterre  near  Paris (A.d.  422),  and,  when  only  seven  years  old, blessed  in  a  special  manner  by  St.  Germanus of  Auxerre,  who  foretold  her  sanctity  and  the vow  of  virginity  by  which  she  would  bind herself.  At  fifteen  she  received  the  veil  of  the Spouses  of  Christ,  and  thenceforth  led  a  life of  penance,  bearing  with  heroic  patience  the calumnies  and  persecutions  which  became  her lot.  She  greatly  helped  the  Parisians  during the  siege  of  their  city  by  the  Franks.  Later, she  again  saved  it  from  destruction,  as,  through her  prayers,  Attila  the  Hun  suddenly  changed his  devastating  course  through  Gaul  and turned  aside  his  army,  while  still  south  of  Paris. St.  Genevieve  died  a.d.  512.  Her  relics  were at  once  venerated ;  and  to  a  church  in  which she  was  buried  her  name  was  given.  She  is honoured  as  Patron  Saint  of  Paris.  Her  relics were  burned  during  the  great  Revolution  at the  end  of  the  eighteenth  century,  and  her stately  church  has  now  been  turned  into  the so-called  Pantheon.

Otherwise  St.  GODFREY,  which  see. GEORGE  of  ANTIOCH  (St.)  Bp.,  M. (April  19)  
(9th  cent.)  A  zealous  Bishop  of  Antioch  in Pisidia  (Asia  Minor),  previously  a  monk,  one of  the  Fathers  of  the  Second  Council  of  Nicaea (a.d.  787),  and  a  strenuous  champion  of  the Faith  against  the  Iconoclasts.  Banished  by the  Emperor  Leo  V  the  Armenian,  he  died  in exile  a.d.  814,  and  is  honoured  as  a  Saint  by Greeks  and  Latins  alike. GEORGE  THE  MARTYR  (St.)  (April  23)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  George,  whom  the  Greeks style  "  the  great  Martyr,"  though  honoured alike  in  the  East  and  in  the  West,  is  one  of those  Saints  of  whom  we  know  least.  He  was an  officer  in  the  army  of  Diocletian,  the  persecuting Emperor,  and  for  refusing  to  sacrifice  was tortured  and  beheaded  at  Nicomedia,  a  town of  Asia  Minor  on  an  inlet  of  the  Sea  of  Marmora (a.d.  303).  Some  say  that  St.  George  was  the young  Christian  who,  as  Eusebius  relates,  tore down  the  Imperial  edict  of  persecution.  But of  this  there  is  no  proof.  St.  George  is  usually represented  on  horseback  vanquishing  a  dragon. This  is  merely  symbolic  of  the  Martyr's  victory over  the  devil ;  and  in  the  East  is  not  an unusual  emblem  of  Christian  sanctity.  The popular  legend  of  St.  George  and  the  Dragon is  of  course  fabulous.  Equally  baseless  are  the now  discredited  assertions  once  common  among Non-Catholics,  that  St.  George  is  a  myth  ;  that he  is  the  heretic  George  of  Cappadocia, murdered  at  Alexandria,  &c,  &c.  The Crusaders  gave  great  impetus  to  Western devotion  to  St.  George,  though  venerated in  the  West  long  before.  From  about  the thirteenth  century,  he  came  to  be  regarded as  Patron  of  England,  partially  displacing  St. Edward  the  Confessor. GEORGE, FELIX, AURELIUS, NATALIA and 
LILIOSA  (SS.)  MM.  (July  27)  
(9th  cent.)  Martyrs  who  suffered  at  Cordova in  Spain  under  the  Caliph  Abderrahman  II (a.d.  852  about).  Felix  and  Aurelius,  with their  wives,  Natalia  and  Liliosa,  were  Spaniards  ; but  the  deacon,  George,  was  a  monk  from Palestine,  who,  though  offered  acquittal  as  a foreigner,  preferred  to  throw  in  his  lot  with  the others.  Surius  and  other  authors  put  the Feast  of  these  Martyrs  a  month  later  (Aug.  27). The  bodies  of  SS.  George  and  Aurelius  were later  translated  to  the  Abbey  church  of  St. Germain  at  Paris. GEORGE  LIMNIOTES  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  24)  
(8th  cent.)  A  holy  hermit  of  Mount  Olympus in  Asia  Minor,  who  had  reached  the  age  (it  is said)  of  ninety-five,  when,  on  account  of  his zealous  opposition  to  the  Iconoclasts,  he suffered  death,  or,  as  others  have  it,  was  only maimed  by  the  orders  of  the  Emperor,  Leo  the Isaurian  (a.d.  730  about).

See  SS.  FRONTO  and  GEORGE. GEORGE  of  VIENNE  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  2)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Vienne  In  France, who  flourished  probably  at  the  beginning  of the  eighth  century,  though  some  put  Nov.  2, a.d.  G99  as  the  date  of  his  death.  He  was canonised  a.d.  1251. GEORGIA  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  15)  
(5th  cent.)  A  holy  virgin  who  led  a  retired and  austere  life  near  Clermont  in  Auvergne (France)  towards  a.d.  500.  Her  sanctity  was attested  by  many  miracles.  It  is  said  that  a flight  of white doves coming no one knew 
122 

whence,  attended  her  body  to  its  tomb,  and long  hovered  over  her  resting-place.  

♦GERALD  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  10)  
(8th  cent.)  One  of  the  English  monks  who accompanied  St.  Colman  on  his  retirement (A.D.  664)  from  Northumbria  to  Ireland,  on occasion  of  the  dispute  about  the  date  of Easter.  In  Mayo,  St.  Colman  placed  St. Gerald  at  the  head  of  the  English  House  founded by  him,  which  is  said  to  have  been  the  nursery of  over  one  hundred  Saints,  a.d.  732  is  given as  the  year  of  St.  Gerald's  death,  at  a  very advanced  age.  

♦GERALD  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  5)

♦GERALD  of  AURILLAC  (St.)  (Oct.  13)  
(10th  cent.)  A  Count  of  Aurillac,  who  led  a life  of  great  virtue  and  practised  in  the  world the  penitential  exercises  of  the  cloister.  He denied  himself  every  comfort  in  order  to  relieve the  distress  of  the  poor.  He  was  scrupulously just  and  at  the  same  time  most  considerate  in his  dealings  with  his  numerous  vassals.  He died  a.d.  909,  and  many  miracles  attested  his sanctity.  

♦GERALD  of  BEZIERS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  5)  
(12th  cent.)  This  Saint  (called  by  the French  St.  Guiraud)  was  a  Canon  Regular,  who became  Bishop  of  Beziers  in  the  South  of France.  He  spent  all  his  revenues  in  relieving the  distress  of  the  poor  of  his  Diocese.  He  died A.d.  1123.  

GERARD  of  TOUL  (St.)  Bp.  (April  23)  
(10th  cent.)  A  native  of  Cologne  who,  in his  youth,  having  seen  his  own  mother  struck dead  by  lightning,  embraced  a  life  of  penance. Made  Bishop  of  Toul  (a.d.  963),  he  rebuilt  his Cathedral  and  otherwise  benefited  his  Diocese. A  learned  man  himself,  he  gathered  Greek  and other  scholars  around  him.  He  died  a.d.  994, in  the  odour  of  sanctity,  and  was  canonised by  Pope  St.  Leo  IX,  who  had  been  one  of  his successors  in  the  See  of  Toul.  

♦GERARD  (St.)  (April  28)  
(Probably  7th  cent.)  An  English  pilgrim,  a companion  of  St.  Ardwine.  He  died  at  Gallinaro  in  the  South  of  Italy  while  on  the  pilgrimage to  Palestine,  and  is  there  liturgically  honoured as  a  Saint  and  Patron  of  the  district. The  century  in  which  he  flourished  is  a  matter of  controversy.  

GERARD  of  HUNGARY  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.  24) (11th  cent.)  A  Benedictine  monk  of  Venice, invited  to  Hungary  by  St.  Stephen,  First Christian  King  of  that  country.  St.  Gerard became  one  of  its  Apostles.  Made  Bishop  of Chunad,  he  converted  two-thirds  of  the  population to  Christianity.  In  the  disorders  which followed  on  the  death  of  St.  Stephen,  he  was set  upon  by  the  Pagans  and  cruelly  done  to death  (a.d.  1046).  His  relics  were  afterwards translated  to  Venice,  where  they  are  now honoured.  

GERARD  (St.)  Abbot.  (Oct.  3)  
(10th  cent.)  An  Official  of  noble  birth  at the  Court  of  the  Prince-Counts  of  Namur,  who relinquished  prospects  of  high  advancement in  the  world  to  become  a  simple  monk  at St.  Denis  near  Paris.  Sent  back  after  five  years to  Namur,  he  spent  the  rest  of  his  life  in  reforming the  discipline  of  the  Flemish  monasteries, eighteen  of  which  received  his  Rule.  Having obtained  the  Papal  approbation  of  his  Reform, he  passed  to  his  reward  A.D.  959.  

GERARD  MAJELLA  (St.)  (Oct.  16)  
(18th  cent.)  A  Redemptorist  Saint,  born A.D.  1725,  in  the  South  of  Italy,  who  to  the customary  vows  of  the  Religious  life  added  that of  ever  doing  that  which  was  most  perfect. His  life  of  prayer  and  humble  obedience  drew down  to  him  marvellous  supernatural  graces. He  worked  many  miracles  in  his  life,  and  they have been multiplied since his holy death 
GERMANUS 

(a.d. 1755).  He  is  now  the  object  of  much popular  devotion  throughout  the  world. GERARD  of  POTENZA  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  30)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  at  Piacenza,  he  was enrolled  among  the  clergy  of  Potenza  in  the South  of  Italy,  and,  on  account  of  his  virtues, elected  Bishop  of  that  city,  although  already advanced  in  age.  He  died  in  the  ninth  year of  his  Episcopate  (a.d.  1119).  Several  miracles having  borne  witness  to  his  sanctity,  Pope Callistus  II  canonised  him  a  few  years  later.
♦GERARD  (Bl.)  (June  13)  
(12th  cent.)  A  Cistercian  monk,  the  brother of  St.  Bernard  of  Clairvaux.  The  sermon  of the  latter  on  the  occasion  of  Gerard's  holy  death is  one  of  the  most  touchingly  beautiful  pieces of  Mediaeval  Prose  literature  we  possess (a.d.  1138). GERASIMUS  (St.)  (March  5)  
(5th  cent.)  A  monk  at  first  in  Lycia  (Asia Minor)  and  afterwards  in  Palestine,  where,  in  a monastery  which  he  had  founded  on  the  banks of  the  Jordan,  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Jericho, he  trained  numerous  disciples.  He  died  a.d. 475.  In  his  youth,  for  some  time  a  follower  of the  heretic  Eutychcs,  he  for  all  the  rest  of  his life  did  severe  penance  for  his  fault.
♦GEREBERN  (GEREBRAND)  (St.)  M. (May  15)  
(7th  cent.)  St.  Gerebern  or  Gerebrand  was the  Irish  priest  who  accompanied  St.  Dympna in  her  flight  to  Belgium,  and  who  was  privileged to  share  with  her  her  crown  of  Martyrdom  at Gheel  in  that  country.  They  suffered  some time  in  the  seventh  century,  but  the  records  are very  imperfect.  St.  Gerebern  is  Patron  Saint of  a  village  in  Rhenish  Prussia,  where  his  relics are  enshrined. GEREMARUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  24)  
(7th  cent.)  Born  A.D.  608,  of  rich  and  noble parents,  the  Merovingian  King  Dagobert  I made  him  (with  his  friends  Eloi  and  Ouen) Royal  Councillors.  By  his  saintly  wife,  Domana, he  had  three  children,  of  whom  the  youngest, Amalberga,  is  honoured  as  a  Saint.  When  free to  do  so,  he  entered  a  monastery,  and  later became  its  Abbot ;  but,  after  an  attempt  on his  life,  he  retired  for  five  years  to  a  hermit's cell.  Finally,  he  founded  another  monastery near  Beauvais,  and  a  few  years  afterwards  died a  holy  death  as  Abbot  of  the  same  (a.d.  658). GEREON  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  10)  
(3rd  cent.)  These  heroic  Christians,  three hundred  and  nineteen  in  number,  appear  to have  formed  part  of  the  famous  Theban  Legion, massacred  by  order  of  the  Emperor  Maximian (a.d.  286).  St.  Gereon  would  therefore  be  the officer  in  command  of  the  detachment.  St. Hanno  of  Cologne  discovered  and  enshrined their  remains  in  the  eleventh  century. GERINUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  2)  
(7th  cent.)  The  brother  of  St.  Leger  (Leodegarius)  and,  like  him,  persecuted  by  Ebroin, Mayor  of  the  Palace  to  the  Merovingian  "  roi faineant,"  Thierry  III.  Stoned  to  death  near Arras  (a.d.  676),  he  was  honoured  by  the people  as  a  Saint  and  a  Martyr.
♦GERLACH  (St.)  (Jan.  5)  
(12th  cent.)  A  holy  hermit  in  great  veneration at  Liege  and  Aix-la-Chapelle.  He  lived  a life  of  singular  austerity  and  seclusion,  but  did wonders  for  the  winning  of  souls  to  God  and was  much  esteemed  and  honoured  by  the Popes  of  his  time.  He  died  a.d.  1170.
♦GERMAN  GARDINER  (Bl.)  M.  (March  7)  
(16th  cent.)  Of  German  (Jermyn)  Gardiner, Secretary  of  the  Bishops  of  Winchester,  it  is not  known  whether  he  was  a  priest  or  a  layman. He  won  the  Crown  of  Martyrdom  about  a.d. 1544. GERM  ANA  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  19)  

Spe  SS.  PAUL,  GERONTIUS,  &c. GERMANA  (GERMAINE)  COUSIN  (June  15)  
(St.)  V.  

(17th cent.) A poor girl, daughter of a farm  labourer  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Toulouse 

(South  of  France),  who  passed  her  short  and innocent  life  in  minding  sheep  and  other  out-ofdoor  rural  work.  Both  from  ill-health  and  from ill-treatment  at  the  hands  of  a  stepmother,  her days  passed  in  suffering  patiently  borne,  comforted only  by  Almighty  God,  who  privileged her  by  close  union  with  Himself  in  high  prayer, until  He  called  her  to  a  better  life,  a.d.  1601, when  she  had  entered  on  the  twenty-second year  of  her  age.  Forty  years  after  her  death her  body  was  found  incorrupt.  Many  miracles witnessed  to  her  sanctity,  and  she  was  canonised by  Pope  Pius  IX  (A.D.  1862). GERMANICUS  (St.)  M.  (jan.  19)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Smyrna  in  Asia Minor  who  suffered  a.d.  168,  at  the  same  time as  St.  Polycarp  under  the  Emperor  Marcus Aurelius.  The  celebrated  Letter  of  the  contemporary Christians  of  Smyrna  to  those  of Philadelphia  makes  special  mention  of  Germanicus,  who  was  thrown  to  the  wild  beasts in  the  Amphitheatre  at  the  Public  Games. GERMANUS  (St.)  M.  (May  2)  

See  SS.  SATURNINUS,  NEOPOLUS, &c.
♦GERMANUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (May  2)  
(5th  cent.)  Described  in  his  ancient  Life as  "  Scotus."  It  is  not  unlikely  therefore  that he  was  of  Irish  origin.  His  conversion  to Christianity  is  attributed  to  St.  Germanus  of Auxerre,  who  visited  Britain  in  the  fifth  century, and  whose  name  he  took.  Passing  into  Gaul, he  did  much  Apostolic  work,  and  in  the  end was  put  to  death  for  the  Faith  in  Normandy, about  A.D.  460. GERMANUS  of  CONSTANTINOPLE  (May  12)  
(St.)  Bp.  

(8th  cent.)  The  son  of  a  famous  Senator, from  being  Bishop  of  Cyzicus  he  was  raised  to the  Patriarchate  of  Constantinople  (a.d.  715). With  undaunted  courage  he  resisted  the Monothelites  and  the  Iconoclasts,  even  refusing to  publish  the  Imperial  Edict  (a.d.  725),  by which  the  honouring  of  Holy  Pictures  was interdicted.  In  consequence,  he  was  banished, and  died  in  exile  (a.d.  733). GERMANUS  of  PARIS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  28)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  near  Autun  (a.d.  496),  he was  there  ordained  priest,  and  became  Abbot  of a  monastery.  Happening  to  be  in  Paris  when the  See  was  vacant,  he  was  elected  (a.d.  554) Bishop  of  that  city.  On  account  of  his  charity styled  the  "  Father  of  the  Poor,"  he  by  his zeal  and  example  wrought  a  wonderful  change in  the  morals  of  the  people,  converting  even  the careless  King  Childebert  to  the  living  of  a Christian  life.  The  latter  founded  the  monastery of  St.  Vincent  (now  known  as  S.  Germain des  Prte),  in  which  he  was  buried  (a.d.  561), and  after  him  (a.d.  576)  the  holy  Bishop,  his truest  friend,  to  whose  sanctity  many  miracles have  borne  witness.  St.  Germanus'  account of  the  Gallican  Rite  is  liturgically  of  great  value. GERMANUS  (St.)  M.  (Julv  7)  

See  SS.  PEREGRINUS,  LUCIAN, &c.
♦GERMANUS  and  RANDOALD  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  21)  
(7th  cent.)  St.  Germanus  was  a  citizen  of Treves  and  disciple  of  St.  Arnulph  of  Metz. He  became  a  monk  of  Luxeuil  under  the  Irish Rule  of  St.  Columbanus  ;  and  later  was  appointed Abbot  of  a  monastery  in  Switzerland. In  his  struggles  with  the  neighbouring  Barons, undertaken  in  order  to  save  the  villagers  of  the district  from  spoliation  and  murder,  he  was put  to  death  by  the  marauding  soldiery  about a.d.  666.  A  fellow-monk,  by  name  Randaut or  Randoald,  shared  with  him  the  crown  of martvrdom. GERMANUS  of  AUXERRE  (St.)  Bp. (July  31)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  at  Auxerre,  about  A.D.  378, of  noble  parents,  he  studied  Civil  Law  in  Rome, married  a  lady  of  rank  equal  to  his  own,  and  by the  Emperor  Honorius,  was  made  Governor {Dux)  of  his  native  Province.  From  a.d.  418, his  manner  of  life,  up  to  then  far  from  edifying, underwent a complete change.  He received 
123 

GERMANUS 
priest's  orders,  and  very  soon  became  "Rishop of  Auxerre,  which  Diocese  he  governed  with wonderful  gain  to  souls  for  thirty  years.  His successful  mission  with  St.  Lupus  of  Troyes, to  Britain  against  the  Pelagians,  has  made  him famous  there,  where  several  churches  have been  dedicated  to  him.  It  was  then  that  he led  the  islanders  to  their  famous  Alleluia  victory over  the  Saxons.  Later,  he  again  visited Britain,  and  is  said  to  have  ordained  the  great Welsh  Saints,  Dubritius  and  Illtyd.  Engaged in  an  errand  of  mercy  to  the  Court  of  the  Eraperer  Valentinian  III,  he  died  at  Ravenna  in Italy  (July  31,  a.d.  448).  His  body  at  his dying  request  was  brought  back  to  Auxerre. His  remains  were  destroyed  during  the  French Revolution.  Among  the  striking  miracles  he wrought,  his  raising  up  from  the  dead  the  son of  Volusian,  Secretary  to  Sigisvult  the  Patrician, is  the  most  famous. GERMANUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.

See  SS.  DONATIAN,  PR^ESLDIUS, &c. GERMANUS  of  BESANCON  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Desideratus in  the  See  of  Besancjon.  Particulars  of  his  life have  been  lost,  but  it  appears  certain  that  he met  his  death  at  the  hands  of  heretics  (probably Allans)  about  the  end  of  the  fourth  century. GERMANUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  23)  

See  SS.  SERVANDUS  and  GERMANUS. GERMANUS  of  CAPUA  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  30)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Legate  to  Constantinople (a.d.  519)  of  Pope  St.  Hormisdas,  charged  to deal  with  one  of  the  Schisms,  the  outcome of  the  Eutychian  heresy.  A  man  of  saintly life,  he  governed  for  more  than  twenty  years the  important  See  of  Capua  and  died  Oct.  30, a.d.  540  about,  St.  Benedict  at  Monte  Cassino, being  at  the  instant  it  occurred  favoured  by  a vision  of  the  glorious  passing  of  the  Saint  to  a better  world.

(4th  cent.)  Under  the  title  of  the  "  Innumerable Martyrs,"  Holy  Church  commemorates a  multitude  of  Christians,  done  to  death  at Treves  in  Germany,  in  the  persecution  under Diocletian  and  Maximian  Herculeus,  towards the  close  of  the  third  century,  Rictius  Varus being  at  the  time  Prefect  of  the  Gauls. GERMANY  (MARTYRS  OF)  (Oct.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  Three  hundred  and  sixty  Christian soldiers,  put  to  death  as  Christians,  outside the  walls  of  Cologne,  in  the  persecution  under Diocletian  and  Maximian,  about  A.D.  303. *GERMOC  (St.)  (June  24)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irish  chieftain,  brother  of  St.  

Breaca,  who settled  in  Cornwall,  near  Mount's 
Bay.  Outside St. Germoc's church, a stone 
called  St.  Germoc's  Chair  may  still  be  seen.  

♦GEROLD  (St.)  Hermit.  (April  19)  
(10th  cent.)  A  member  of  the  Ducal  House of  Saxony  who  embraced  the  life  of  a  Solitary in  the  Tyrol  and  attained  to  high  sanctity. His  grave  is  still  a  place  of  pilgrimage,  and  his memory  is  especially  honoured  in  the  Abbey Church  of  Einsiedeln  in  Switzerland. GERONTIUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  19)  

See  SS.  PAUL,  GERONTIUS, &c. GERONTIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (May  9)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Cervia,  near  Ravenna, who  attended  a  Synod  held  in  Rome  by  Pope Symmachus  (a.d.  501)  and  who  was  attacked and  murdered  on  his  return  journey,  at  Cagli on  the  Flaminian  Way,  under  circumstances which  led  to  his  being  honoured  as  a  Martyr. *GERONTIUS  (GERAINT)  (St.)  

King,  M.  (Aug.  10)  
(6th cent.)  Son of Erbin, and King of 
124 

Damnonia  (Devon).  He  fell  in  battle  against the  Saxons  (a.d.  508).  Much  romantic  legend has  been  woven  about  his  life  and  that  of  his wife,  Enid.  Another  St.  Gerontius,  King  of Cornwall,  died  A.D.  596.  St.  Gerrans  in  Cornwall and  St.  Geran  in  Brittany  have  the  one or  the  other  for  Patron  Saint.  

♦GERTRUDE  of  HAMAGE  (St.)  Widow.  (Dec.  6) (7th  cent.)  The  widow  of  a  nobleman  in  the present  Belgium,  who  retired  into  a  solitary place  in  order  to  live  the  life  of  an  Anchoress  ; but  soon  found  herself  at  the  head  of  a  numerous community  of  nuns  who  had  gathered  round her.  She  died  about  A.D.  655.  

GERTRUDE  of  NIVELLES  (St.)  V.  (March  17) (7th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  Pepin  of Landen,  Mayor  of  the  Palace  to  King  Clotaire  II and  to  two  of  his  successors.  When  only twenty-one  years  old,  Gertrude  was  placed  at the  head  of  the  Abbey  of  Nivelles,  in  which  her own  mother,  Itta,  its  foundress  thenceforth lived  as  her  daughter's  subject.  St.  Gertrude was  distinguished  for  her  care  of  the  poor  and for  culture  of  mind  remarkable  in  that  age, though  far  from  uncommon  in  the  monasteries of  the  time.  She  is  said  to  have  known  nearly the  whole  Bible  by  heart.  In  art,  she  is  usually depicted  so  absorbed  in  contemplation  that  a mouse  quietly  climbs  up  the  Pastoral  Staff  at her  side.  She  passed  the  three  last  years  of  her life  almost  entirely  in  exercises  of  devotion  and penance,  falling  asleep  in  Christ  some  time between  a.d.  659  and  a.d.  664,  at  the  early  age of  thirty-three.  

GERTRUDE  (St.)  V.  (Nov.  17)  
(14th  cent.)  The  holy  nun  of  singular  learning and  endued  with  high  gifts  of  mystic  prayer, who  has  left  us  the  "  Insinuationes  Divinse  Pietatis,"  a  work  comparable  to  the  writings  of St.  Teresa,  and  enriched  with  sublime  imagery. Tradition  assigns  Eisleben  in  Saxony  as  her birthplace,  and  makes  her  Abbess  successively of  Rudersdorff  and  of  Heldelfs.  But  modern research  distinguishes  the  Abbess  St.  Gertrude from  her  contemporary  the  mystic  Saint  of  the same  name,  a  nun  in  the  monastery  of  the former.  They  flourished  in  the  latter  half  of the  thirteenth  century,  and  Nov.  17,  A.D.  1334, is  assigned  as  the  date  of  the  death  of  the  survivor. That  St.  Mechtildis,  another  celebrated mystic  writer,  was  sister  of  either  St.  Gertrude is  also  now  controverted.  The  Church  keeps the  Feast  of  St.  Gertrude  on  Nov.  15,  though in  certain  Kalendars  it  is  found  noted  on April  12  or  Nov.  12.  The  confusing  together of  two  or  more  Saints  of  the  same  name  has evidently  led  to  this  discrepancy.  The  works of  SS.  Gertrude  and  Mechtelde,  edited  by  the Benedictines  of  Solesmes,  may  be  usefully consulted.  

♦GERULPH  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  21)  
(8th  cent.)  A  youth  in  Flanders,  heir  to  a great  estate  and  distinguished  for  the  holiness of  his  life,  who  on  his  way  back  from  the  church where  he  had  received  the  Sacrament  of  Confirmation was  treacherously  murdered  by  a relative  in  hopes  of  succeeding  to  his  inheritance. St.  Gerulph  died  (about  a.d.  746)  pardoning  his murderer,  and  is  venerated  as  a  Martyr  at Tronchiennes.  

GERUNTIUS  of  MILAN  (St.)  Bp.  (May  5)  
(5th  cent.)  The  successor  at  Milan  in  the fifth  century  of  St.  Eusebius.  He  appears  to have  governed  the  Diocese  for  about  five  years, dying  a.d.  470,  though  no  reliable  account of  his  Episcopate  has  reached  us.  St.  Charles Borromeo  enshrined  his  Relics  in  the  church of  St.  Svmphorian  in  the  city  of  Milan.  

GERUNTIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  25)  
(1st  cent.) A Missionary  in  Spain in the 
Apostolic  Age, reckoned as Bishop  of  Talco 
(Seville).  A  special  Hymn  in  the  old  Mozarabic 
Breviary  commemorates  him.  

♦GERVADIUS  (GERNAD,  GARNAT)  (St.)  (Nov.  8) (10th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  who  crossed  over 
GLYCERIA 

to  Moray  and  afterwards  retired  as  a  recluse  to near  Elgin.  

GERVASE  and  PROTASE  (SS.)  MM.  (June  19) (1st  cent.)  Two  brothers,  sons  of  the Martyr,  St.  Vitalis,  were  Christian  heroes  who have  ever  been  held  in  high  honour  in  the Western  Church.  St.  Ambrose  styled  them  the Proto-Martyrs  of  Milan,  where  they  suffered in  the  first  century  of  our  era,  either  under Nero  or  under  Domitian.  Many  miracles illustrated  the  discovery  and  Translation  of their  relics  by  St.  Ambrose,  towards  the  close of  the  fourth  century.  They  now  repose  at Milan  in  the  Ambrosian  Basilica.

GETULIUS,  C/EREALIS,  AMANTIUS  and 
PRIMITIVUS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  10)  
(2nd  cent.)  Roman  Martyrs  who  suffered under  Hadrian  (a.d.  117-138).  They  were scourged  and  tied  to  the  stake  to  be  burned alive.  But  miraculously  spared  by  the  flames, they  were  in  fine  clubbed  to  death.  St.  Getulius is  said  to  have  been  a  man  distinguished  both  by birth  and  by  learning.  

♦GIBRIAN  (St.)  (May  8)  
(5th  and  6th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who,  with his  five  brothers  and  three  sisters,  crossed  over to  France  and  led  a  life  of  penance  and  contemplation near  Chfilons-sur-Marne.  His  relics were  enshrined  in  Rheims  Cathedral,  many miracles  worked  both  during  his  life  and  after his  death  attesting  his  great  sanctity.  

GILBERT  (St.)  (Feb.  4)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  at  Sempringham  in Lincolnshire  and  ordained  priest  by  the  Bishop of  Lincoln,  he  became  Parish  Priest  of  his native  village,  distributing  yearly  to  the  poor the  revenues  of  his  benefice.  He  founded  a convent  of  nuns  and  afterwards  an  Order  of men,  which  he  himself  joined,  the  Rule  having been  approved  by  Pope  Eugene  III.  He  lived the  life  of  penance  and  zeal  he  had  thus  professed till  his  holy  death  (Feb.  3,  1190),  having,  it  is said,  reached  the  age  of  one  hundred  and  six years.  He  was  canonised  a.d.  1202.  His Order,  once  widespread  in  England,  has  been long  extinct.  

♦GILBERT  (St.)  Bp.  (April  1)  
(13th  cent.)  For  twenty  years  Bishop  of Caithness,  of  which  Diocese  he  built  the  Cathedral. He  was  a  zealous  Pastor  of  souls,  and also  a  valued  servant  of  the  Scottish  Kings  of his  time.  He  died  a.d.  1240.  Many  miracles are  recorded  of  him.

GILDARD  (GODARD)  (St.)  Bp.  (June  18)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Rouen,  once  erroneously supposed  to  have  been  the  brother  of St.  Medard  of  Soissons.  He  assisted  at  the Council  of  Orleans  (a.d.  511),  and  governed  his own  Church  with  great  zeal  for  about  fifteen years,  dying  probably  early  in  the  same  century. Buried  at  Rouen,  his  remains  were  afterwards removed  to  Soissons.  

♦GILDAS  THE  ELDER  (St.)  (Jan.  29)  
(6th  cent.)  He  appears  to  have  been  associated with  St.  Cadoc  at  Llancarvan  and  to  have afterwards  lived  as  a  hermit  in  an  island  off the  South  coast  of  Wales.  Glastonbury  Abbey claimed  to  have  been  the  scene  of  his  death, and  to  have  possessed  his  relics.  He  is  often confused  with  his  namesake,  the  more  famous Gildas  the  Wise.

The  many  miracles  he wrought  made  him  famous  in  the  West  of Europe,  as  is  evidenced  by  popular  devotion and  by  the  many  churches  which  bear  his  name. He  died  early  in  the  eighth  century.

Born  in  Aquitaine  in  France  and there  ordained  priest,  St.  Goar  embraced  the life  of  a  hermit,  at  a  spot  on  the  banks  of  the Rhine,  which  still  bears  his  name.  His  life was  austere,  and  he  was  accustomed  after  his Mass  to  recite  daily  the  whole  Psalter.  His cell  became  during  his  lifetime  the  resort  of numberless  pilgrims.  Many  wonderful  things are  related  of  him.  One  among  them  is  to  the effect  that  the  tongue  of  a  baby  of  three  days old  bore  witness  to  his  innocence  when  falsely accused  before  his  Bishop.  He  died  a.d.  575, and  in  memory  of  him  Charlemagne  built  a stately  church  over  his  humble  grave.

He  died  a holy  death  (A.D.  1038)  in  the  nineteenth  year of  his  Episcopate,  and  was  canonised  by  Pope Innocent  II  (a.d.  1131). GODFREY  (GEOFFREY)  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  8)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  A.D.  1066,  he  was  offered by  his  parents,  when  yet  only  five  years  old, to  the  monastery  of  St.  Quentin.  He  became  a model  monk,  and  as  such  was  elected  Abbot  of Nogent,  and  later,  much  against  his  will, Bishop  of  Amiens.  Comforter  and  helper  of all  in  distress,  he  was  distinguished  throughout his  life  for  his  meekness  and  patience.  His wish  to  retire  among  the  Carthusians  was frustrated  by  the  entreaties  of  his  Archbishop, clergy  and  people.  He  fell  asleep  in  Christ  at Soissons,  a.d.  1115,  in  the  fiftieth  year  of  his age  and  the  thirteenth  of  his  Episcopate. *GODLIVA  (St.)  M.  (July  6)

There  are  legendary  Lives  connecting  him  with Wales,  Rome  and  Glastonbury  ;  but  nothing is  known  for  certain  about  him,  though  from the  Dedication  of  a  church  to  him  in  Brittany it  may  be  conjectured  that  he  resided  for  some time  in  that  country.  

♦GOLVINUS  (GOLWEN)  (St.)  Bp.  (July  9)  
(7th  cent,  probably.)  A  Breton  Saint  but  of British  origin,  whose  fame  for  sanctity  led  to  his appointment  as  Bishop  of  St.  Paul  de  Leon. After  a  useful  pastorate  he  passed  away  at Rennes  where  his  relics  were  enslirined.

He  became  King  of  Orleans in  the  partition  of  the  Frankish  monarchy  and governed  his  people  in  justice  and  mercy,  going so  far  as  to  pardon  two  of  his  would-be  assassins. His  sin  in  divorcing  his  wife  and  over-hastily ordering  the  execution  of  his  physician,  like David,  he  wept  over  till  the  day  of  his  death, which  happened  A.D.  593,  when  he  was  in  his sixty-ninth  year.  Beloved  by  his  subjects,  he was  at  once  by  them  acclaimed  as  a  Saint. Miracles  as  well  in  life  as  after  death  are  attributed to  him.  

GOOD  THIEF  (THE)  (March  25)  
(1st  cent.)  Our  Lord's  words  on  the Cross  promising  him  Paradise  have  entitled the  Good  Thief  to  be  registered  among  the Saints  honoured  by  the  Catholic  Church. Apochryphal  Gospels  and  other  ancient  writings assign  to  him  the  name  of  DISMAS,  and  give various  details  concerning  him.  But  we  have nothing  in  any  way  historical  to  allege.  His Feast,  though  kept  on  various  days,  is  put  in the  Roman  Martyrology.  as  by  the  Greeks,  on March  25,  from  an  old  belief  that  Our  Lord's Crucifixion,  and  therefore  the  Good  Thief's confession,  fell  on  that  day  in  the  year  of  the T^ocsioti

Ten  of  them  were  Franciscan  Friars,  two Pre-monstratensiaDS,  one  a  Dominican,  one  a Canon  Regular,  four  Secular  priests,  and  one a  layman.  The  savagery  of  the  Dutch  Calvinists  is  notorious  ;  but  one  is  appalled  in reading  the  tortures,  physical  and  moral,  to which  these  nineteen  Martyrs  were  subjected, before  being  hanged,  the  one  charge  against them  being  that  they  were  faithful  Catholics. They  were  canonised  by  Pope  Pius  IX  (a.d. 1867).  

GORDIAN  (St.)  M.  (May  10)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  judge,  who  being  still a  Pagan,  undertook  to  carry  out  the  persecuting Edict  of  the  Emperor  Julian  the  Apostate.

Arrested  and  tried in  his  turn,  he  was  beheaded,  after  torture,  in Rome,  A.D.  362.  His  relics,  with  those  of St.  Epimachus  of  Alexandria  (who  suffered under  Decius  a.d.  250),  are  now  venerated  at Kempten  in  Bavaria.

Later,  returning  to  the  city,  he, moved  by  his  zeal  in  the  cause  of  Christ, addressed  the  crowd,  seeking  to  make  converts. He  was  seized  and,  after  trial,  beheaded  in some  year  between  a.d.  314  and  a.d.  320.  An eloquent  Panegyric  preached  by  St.  Basil,  in which  he  reminds  his  hearers  that  some  among them  had  seen  St.  Gordius  die,  has  perpetuated his  memory.

(3rd  cent.)  Some  say  that  these  holy Confessors  suffered  at  Nicaea  in  Bithynia ; others  at  Antioch  in  Syria  ;  but  nothing  precise is  known  about  them,  save  that  they  were victims  of  one  of  the  third  century  persecutions.

He  boldly  opposed  the  outbreak  of  Iconoclasm under  Leo  the  Isaurian,  and  successfully resisted  the  aggression  of  King  Luitprand  and his  Lombards,  restoring  likewise  many  churches and  monasteries  (among  them  the  Abbey  of Monte  Cassino)  destroyed  by  these  Barbarians. St.  Gregory  frustrated  several  attempts  of  the Eastern  Emperor  to  seize  or  even  murder  him, and  passed  away  in  peace,  Feb.  10,  a.d.  731. He  was  (writes  Anastasius  Bibliothecarius) "  a  man,  pure  in  life,  learned  in  Holy  Scripture, eloquent  of  speech,  and  of  resolute  will." 
GREGORY  of  NYSSA  (St.)  Bp.  (March  9)  
(4th  cent.)  The  brother  of  St.  Basil  the Great.  Having  received  a  good  education  and married  a  virtuous  lady,  he  afterwards  renounced the  world  and  went  to  assist  his  holy  brother and  to  be  later  consecrated  Bishop  of  Nyssa in  Cappadocia  (A.D.  372).  Banished  by  the intrigues  of  the  Arian  faction,  he  was  restored to  his  See  in  378,  and  died  at  Nyssa  some  time between  A.D.  395  and  a.d.  400.  St.  Gregory was  one  of  the  most  prominent  of  the  Fathers who  attended  the  Second  General  Council, that  of  Constantinople  (a.d.  381).  His  copious writings  are  remarkable  for  eloquence  of  diction, and  are  most  valuable  on  account  of  the  powerful and  accurate  exposition  of  Orthodox  doctrine they  embodv.  

GREGORY  THE  GREAT  (St.)  Pope, 
Doctor  of  the  Church.  (March  12)  
(7th  cent.)  The  most  commanding  figure in  the  world  history  of  his  age.  Born  in  Rome (a.d.  540)  of  patrician  parents  (the  Senator Gordian  and  St.  Sylvia),  and  a  collateral descendant  of  Pope  St.  Felix  (whether  II,  III, or  IV,  is  uncertain),  he  was  early  in  life  made Praetor  or  Governor  of  Rome  by  the  Emperor Justin  II.  Relinquishing,  however,  his  prospects of  a  brilliant  future  in  the  world,  he retired  to  the  monastery  into  which  he  had converted  his  family  mansion  on  the  Ccelian Hill  (San  Gregorio).  But  Pope  Benedict  I  soon appointed  him  his  Apocrisiarius  or  Legate  to Constantinople,  where  he  remained  for  seven years.  At  the  death  of  Pope  Pelagius  (a.d. 590),  Gregory,  after  vainly  trying  by  flight  to avoid  the  dignity,  was  elected  his  successor. During  his  thirteen  years  of  Pontificate,  his untiring  energy  (despite  continuous  ill-health) enabled  him  to  accomplish  a  very  thorough Reform  of  Church  discipline,  both  among  the Secular  clergy  and  in  Religious  Houses.  His work  in  Liturgy  and  Church  music  has  proved lasting.  He  dealt  successfully  with  the  yet existing  debris  of  the  old  heresies,  as  is  proved by  his  voluminous  correspondence  with  Spain, Gaul,  Ireland,  and  with  the  Eastern  Patriarchates. He  strenuously  upheld  the  rights  of the  Roman  See  against  the  pretensions  of  the Patriarchs  of  Constantinople ;  but  treated  so wisely  with  the  Byzantine  Emperor  and  other Christian  Princes  as  to  avoid  all  conflict  with them.  His  sending  of  St.  Augustine  with  his forty  monks,  as  first  missionaries  to  the  AngloSaxons,  has  earned  him  the  title  of  Apostle  of England.  He  saved  Rome  from  oppression by  the  Lombards,  who  at  that  time  were devastating  Italy,  and  showed  himself  a  most sagacious  administrator  of  the  Patrimony  of St.  Peter.  His  loving-kindness  to  the  poor, whom  he  delighted  in  ministering  to  with  his own  hands,  has  remained  proverbial.  His 128 

letters, Homilies, Exegetical and Ascetical works  take  up  several  folio  volumes. He  rested from  his  labours,  March  12,  a.d.  604,  and  was buried  in  St.  Peter's. GREGORY  of  ELVIRA  (St.)  Bp.  (April  24)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  champions  of  the Faith  against  Arianism,  and  one  of  the  few Bishops  who  at  Rimini  (A.D.  359)  consistently refused  to  palter  with  the  heretics.  There  is  no proof  at  all,  as  alleged  by  some  Non-Catholics, that  St.  Gregory  took  part  in  the  Schism  of Lucifer  of  Cagliari.  His  Episcopal  city  of  Elvira, from  which  the  See  has  since  been  transferred to  Granada,  was  the  scene  of  several  Spanish Councils.  St.  Gregory  died  before  A.D.  400. GREGORY  of  NAZIANZEN  (St.)  Bp., (May  9)  

Doctor  of  the  Church.  

(4th  cent.)  St.  Gregory  the  Elder,  himself later  Bishop  of  Nazianzus,  a  small  town  of Cappadocia  in  Asia  Minor,  and  St.  Nonna, were  the  parents  of  Gregory,  who  during  his brilliant  course  of  studies  at  Caesarea,  Alexandria and  Athens  (the  fourth  century  centres  of learning),  had  for  fellow-student,  St.  Basil  the Great,  his  compatriot,  and  contracted  with  him an  intimate  friendship.  It  was  not  till  after this  that,  in  accordance  with  the  imperfect Church  discipline  of  his  age,  he  was  even  baptised. He  then  retired  with  St.  Basil  for  a time  to  live  a  monastic  life  in  a  secluded  spot in  Pontus  on  the  Black  Sea.  Recalled  by  his father,  who  ordained  him  priest  (a.d.  361), he  was  by  St.  Basil,  his  Metropolitan,  eleven years  later,  consecrated  Bishop  of  Sasima,  a mere  village,  but  in  reality  became  Coadjutor to  his  own  father  at  Nazianzus,  the  government of  which  See  he  however  persistently  refused  to accept.  The  troubled  Church  of  Constantinople was  to  be  his  chief  field  of  work.  St.  Basil  was dead,  when  St.  Gregory  was  called  there  (A.d. 379  about).  The  Arian  intruder  was  expelled, and  Gregory,  raised  to  the  Patriarchate,  was recognised  as  legitimate  holder  of  the  See  in  the Second  CEcumenical  Council,  then  (a.d.  381) sitting.  He  spent  himself  in  toiling  for  peace and  sound  doctrine,  but  was  soon  forced  to retire ;  and  ended  his  days,  in  company  with other  Solitaries  at  Arianzum,  not  far  from  his native  place.  He  died  in  A.d.  389,  at  an advanced  age.  With  SS.  Athanasius,  Basil and  John  Chrysostom,  St.  Gregory  Nazianzen is  reputed  a  pillar  of  the  Eastern  Church.  His works  in  poetry  and  in  prose  are  voluminous, and  apart  from  their  theological  significance, show  that  his  was  a  literary  genius  of  the  first order.  His  relics  were  translated  to  Rome  in the  Middle  Ages.
♦GREGORY  of  EINSIEDELN  (St.)  (Nov.  8)  

Abbot.  

(10th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  an  AngloSaxon  prince,  who  returning  from  a  pilgrimage to  Rome,  became  a  monk  at  Einsiedeln  in Switzerland,  and  later  Abbot  of  that  monastery. He  died  a.d.  996. GREGORY  VII  (St.)  Pope.  (May  25)  
(11th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  famous  of  the successors  of  St.  Peter.  Born  before  a.d.  1020 of  poor  parents  in  Tuscany,  and  educated  in Rome,  Hildebrand  (for  so  he  was  named  at  his Baptism)  embraced  the  Religious  state  at Cluny  in  France.  Pope  St.  Leo  IX,  who  knew him  there,  recalled  him  to  Rome  to  become Abbot  of  St.  Paul's  and  his  own  councillor  ; and  as  such  he  continued  to  act  under  St.  Leo's successors.  He  was  Archdeacon  of  Rome  when elected  (a.d.  1073)  to  succeed  Pope  Alexander  II. The  great  evils  of  his  time  were  the  prevalent vice  of  simony,  and  the  usurpation  of  authority  in spirituals  by  temporal  rulers.  Gregory's  firmness in  withstanding  the  one  and  the  other, his  battling  with  Henry  IV  of  Germany,  the humiliation  of  the  latter  at  Canossa,  the  renewed conflict  leading  to  the  disastrous  intervention of  Robert  Guiscard  and  the  Normans,  form  an important  episode  in  the  history  of  Mediaeval 
GUARINUS 

Europe.  Tn  the  end,  the  Church  emerged victorious  from  the  struggle.  But  St.  Gregory himself  passed  away  a  fugitive  at  Salerno  near Naples  with  on  his  lips  the  words  :  "  Forasmuch as  I  have  loved  justice  and  hated  iniquity,  therefore do  I  die  in  exile."  (May  25,  A.D.  1085.)  
♦GREGORY  BARBADIGO  (Bl.)  Bishop. (June  15)  
(17th  cent.)  A  Cardinal  Bishop  of  Padua, distinguished  equally  as  a  statesman  and  as  an Ecclesiastic,  but  still  more  illustrious  on  account of  his  piety  and  heroic  patience.  He  died a.d.  1697,  and  miracles  quickly  bore  witness to  his  sanctitv. GREGORY  of  UTRECHT  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  25)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Frank  of  Royal  Blood,  born at  Treves,  at  the  beginning  of  the  eighth  century, the  faithful  disciple  and  companion  of  St. Boniface,  both  in  his  missionary  travels  in Germany  and  in  one  of  his  journeys  to  Rome. From  the  time  of  the  martyrdom  of  St.  Boniface (A.D.  754)  St.  Gregory  governed  the  Church  of Utrecht,  and,  though  it  seems  he  never  received Episcopal  Consecration,  he  is  always  styled Bishop  of  that  city.  Paralysed  during  the  last years  of  Ms  life,  he  continued  to  the  end  to teach  and  encourage  his  numerous  disciples. He  died  A.D.  781. GREGORY  THE  ILLUMINATOR  (St.) (Sept.  30)  

Bishop.  

(4th  cent.)  An  Armenian,  and  reckoned  the Apostle  of  his  native  country  because  of  the numberless  conversions  to  Christianity  he there  effected.  The  extant  Acts  of  the  Saint are  of  doubtful  authority  ;  but  it  seems  certain that  he  was  consecrated  First  Patriarch  or Archbishop  of  the  Armenians,  that  he  succeeded in  converting  Tiridates,  the  King  of the  country,  to  Christianity,  and  that  he suffered  many  persecutions  from  the  heathen. To  the  place  from  which  the  title  of  his  See  is taken  he  gave  the  name  of  Etchmiadzin  (now Vallarshabad),  "The  Descent  of  the  OnlyBegotten."  a.d.  332  is  a  probable  date  of  his death. GREGORY  THAUMATURGUS  (St.)  (Nov.  17)  

Bishop.  

(3rd  cent.)  A  Saint  of  exceeding  celebrity both  in  the  East  and  in  the  West,  who  is  still annually  commemorated  in  the  Liturgy.  Born at  Neo-Caosarea,  a  then  Pagan  city  of  Pontus near  the  Black  Sea,  and  a  disciple  of  the  famous Origen,  he  became  Bishop  of  his  birthplace about  a.d.  240.  At  his  accession  there  were no  more  than  seventeen  Christians  in  the  town  ; and  it  is  related  that  on  his  deathbed  (about A.D.  270)  he  thanked  God  that  only  that  same number  of  idolaters  remained  in  it.  His  title  of Thaumaturgus,  or  Wonder-worker,  he  earned by  the  marvellous  miracles  his  faith  privileged him  to  work,  among  them  the  literal  moving of  mountains  and  drying  up  of  lakes.  He  took part  in  the  Council  of  Antioch  (A.D.  264;,  against Paul  of  Samosata.  His  literary  remains  are  of value  though  fragmentary. GREGORY  of  TOURS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  17)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  in  Auvergne  (a.d.  539) and  of  noble  parentage,  he  was  educated  by  his uncle  the  Bishop  of  Clermont.  Threatened  with a  dangerous  malady,  he  went  as  a  pilgrim  to  the shrine  of  St.  Martin  of  Tours,  and  was  there  by the  people  who  were  struck  by  his  piety  elected to  fdl  the  then  vacant  See  (A.D.  573).  He  built several  churches,  and  assisted  at  the  local French  Councils  of  the  period.  In  learning  and culture  he  was  far  in  advance  of  his  contemporaries, and  attracted  the  favourable  notice  of Pope  St.  Gregory  the  Great.  His  historical writings  are  even  in  our  own  day  continually referred  to  as  throwing  great  light  on  Merovingian times.  He  died  Nov.  17,  A.n.  590. GREGORY  DECAPOLITES  (St.)  (Nov.  20)  
(9th  cent.)  So-called  from  his  birthplace  in Asia  Minor.  A  fervent  ninth  century  Catholic, who  suffered  much  in  the  Iconoclastic  persecution. He  himself  ministered,  so  far  as  he  was 

allowed,  to  the  imprisoned  Faithful.  His  pupil Joseph,  the  Hymnographer,  built  a  monastery over  the  spot  where  his  body  had  been  interred.  

GREGORY  of  AGRIGENTUM  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  23) (6th  cent.)  A  Sicilian  contemporary  of Pope  St.  Gregory  the  Great  who  raised  him, on  his  return  from  a  protracted  sojourn  in  the monasteries  of  the  East,  to  the  See  of  Agrigentum  (Girgenti),  his  native  town,  and  vindicated his  character  when  attacked  by  the  evil-livers he  corrected.  The  dates  concerning  him  are much  disputed ;  but  it  would  seem  fairly certain  that  he  did  not  pass  away  until  after a.d.  600.  

GREGORY  HI  (St.)  Pope.  (Nov.  28)  
(8th  cent.)  Like  his  predecessor,  St.  Gregory II,  St.  Gregory  III  was  distinguished  for  learning and  piety.  He  was  a  Syrian  by  birth  and  his election  was  the  last  for  which  the  Emperor's leave  was  asked,  the  practice  of  doing  so  having lasted  for  nearly  fifty  years.  The  struggle with  the  Iconoclasts  of  the  East  continued through  the  eleven  years  of  his  Pontificate. Against  Luitprand  and  the  Lombards  still  overrunning Italy  St.  Gregory  sought  the  aid  of Charles  Martel,  the  Frankish  leader,  who  had just  overthrown  the  Saracen  invaders  of  Western Europe.  After  a  stormy  Pontificate,  he  died Nov.  27,  A.D.  741.  

GREGORY  of  AUXERRE  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  19)  
(6th  cent.)  The  twelfth  Bishop  of  Auxerre.  

He flourished in  the first  half  of  the  sixth 
century,  and  died  at  the  age  of  eighty-five,  in 
the  thirteenth  year  of  his  Episcopate.  

GREGORY  of  SPOLETO  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  24)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Spoleto  in  Umbria, tortured  and  beheaded  at  the  beginning  of  the fourth  century,  under  Maximian  Herculeus. The  tradition  is  that,  the  Prefect  having  ordered his  remains  to  be  thrown  to  the  wild  beasts kept  for  the  public  games,  a  Christian  woman bought  them  back  at  a  great  price  and  honourably interred  them.  

♦GRIGNON  DE  MONTFORT  (Bl.)  (April  28)

He presided  for  some  time  over  the  Schools  at Oxford ;  but  afterwards  was  called  by  the King  to  Winchester,  where  he  died  (a.d.  903).  

GRIMOALDUS  (St.)  (Sept.  29)  
(12th  cent.)  An  Archpriest  of  Pontecorvo, in  Southern  Italy,  near  Aquino,  where  towards a.d.  1137,  he  built  a  church  to  commemorate an  Apparition  of  St.  John  the  Baptist.  He  died in  odour  of  sanctity  after  a  life  of  austere  piety and  of  works  of  mercy.  He  is  said  by  some  to have  been  born  in  England  and  to  have  been a  brother  of  SS.  Fulk  and  Eleutherius.

GUARINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  6)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  at  Bologna  (Italy)  of noble  family,  he  entered  the  Order  of  Canons Regular.  After  forty  years  of  Religious  life, during  which  his  fame  of  sanctity  became  widespread, he  was  elected  Bishop  of  Pavia  ;  but nothing  could  induce  him  to  accept  the  post. However,  Pope  Lucius  II,  overruling  his reluctance,  created  him  Cardinal  Bishop  of Palestrina,  where  his  great  charity  made  him universally  beloved.  Great  miracles  followed his  holy  death  (a.d.  1159)  and  led  to  his  being canonised  by  Alexander  III.

In  due  course  St.  Guenhael  succeeded the  latter  as  Abbot.  He  introduced the  severe  discipline  followed  in  general  by  the Celtic  Saints  whom  he  passed  over  into  Britain to  consult.  It  is  impossible  to  fix  the  exact date  of  his  death,  which  happened  in  some  year between  A.D.  530  and  A.D.  580.

St.  Gunifort,  hit  by  arrows,  succeeded in  escaping  the  same  fate,  and  in  reaching Pavia,  where  he  however  died  of  the  wounds received.  His  relics  are  still  venerated  at Pavia.  It  is  conjectured  that  these  martyrdoms took  place  under  Maximian  Herculeus,  the ferocious  colleague  of  the  persecuting  Emperor Diocletian,  that  is,  about  A.D.  300.

After  fifteen  years,  during  which  the repute  of  his  sanctity  and  miraculous  gifts  had drawn  many  Bishops  and  Princes,  as  well  as thousands  of  others  of  inferior  degree,  to  seek his  counsel,  he  passed  away  A.D.  714 ;  and  in later  ages  the  great  Abbey  of  Croyland,  erected on  the  site  of  his  poor  cell,  befittingly  enshrined his  sacred  remains.

St.  Hadrian,  an  officer  in  the Imperial  army,  as  a  Pagan  had  taken  part  in the  persecution  of  the  Christians  enforced  by Diocletian.  On  his  conversion  to  the  Faith he  was  arrested  and  put  to  the  torture  at  Nicomedia,  the  Imperial  Residence.  While  yet living,  his  bones  were  broken  with  hammers. Twenty-three  other  Christians  shared  his  fate (A.D. 303). The body of St. Hadrian was 

translated to Constantinople and afterwards to  Rome.  The anniversary  of the latter Translation  is  kept  liturgically  on  Sept.  8. HADRIAN  and  EUBULUS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  5) (4th  cent.)  A  lion  to  which  St.  Hadrian  was thrown in the Amphitheatre having  refused to  touch  him,  he  was  put  to  the  sword,  by  order of the Prefect Firmilian, under Diocletian, at  Caesarea  in  Palestine  (A.  D.  308). St.  Eubulus, another Palestinian Christian, suffered with him. HADRIAN  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  26)  
(4th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  a  son  of  the Emperor  Probus,  and,  having  embraced  Christianity, to  have  been  put  to  death  (a.d.  320), at  Nicomedia  in  Asia  Minor,  by  the  Emperor Licinius.

(9th  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth,  elected  Pope (A.D.  884).  He  ruled  the  Church  during  one  of the  most  troubled  periods  of  her  history.  He laboured  hard  to  alleviate  the  misery  of  the people  of  Italy,  in  prey  to  famine  and  to  continuous war  ;  and  he  firmly  withstood  Photius, author  of  the  still  persisting  Eastern  Schism. Unhappily,  in  the  second  year  of  his  Pontificate, while  travelling  to  Germany  to  induce  the Emperor  Charles  to  support  the  cause  of  the Church  and  to  help  Italy  in  its  distress,  he died  a.d.  885,  near  Modena.  He  was  buried in  the  Abbey  Church  of  Nonantula,  where  his tomb  at  once  became  a  popular  place  of  pilgrimage. *HAILE  (JOHN)  (Bl.)  M.  (May  4)

HEDDA 
HEDDA  (St.)  Bp.  (July  7)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  monk  and Abbot  in  the  North  of  England,  who  became Bishop  of  the  West  Saxons  (A.D.  676)  by  permission of  Pope  St.  Hadrian  I.  He  transferred his  See  from  Dorchester  in  Oxfordshire  to Winchester,  and  governed  his  Diocese  to  the advantage  of  both  Church  and  State  (he  being a  chief  Councillor  of  King  Ina  of  Wessex)  until his  holy  death,  A.D.  705.  Many  miracles attested  his  sanctity. HEDWIG  (HEDWIGIS)  (St.)  Widow.  (Oct.  17)  
(13th  cent.)  Of  princely  race  and  daughter of  a  Duke  of  Dalmatia,  St.  Hedwig  was  married, when  only  a  child,  to  Henry,  Duke  of  Silesia, to  whom  she  bore  six  children.  Later,  by mutual  consent,  they  separated  to  lead  lives  of greater  religious  perfection,  though  St.  Hedwig never  ceased  to  aid  and  comfort  her  husband  in the  many  political  troubles  which  beset  him. She  survived  him  for  fifteen  years,  which  she passed  in  the  practice  of  the  severest  penance  in the  monastery  of  Treibnitz,  near  Cracow,  her only  solace  being  her  devoted  ministering  to  the poor  and  afflicted.  She  passed  away  Oct.  15, A.D.  1243,  at  the  age  of  sixty-nine,  and  was canonised  A.D.  1267  by  Pope  Clement  IV. HEGESIPPUS  (St.)  (April  7)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Jew  by  birth,  who  flourished in  the  second  century  of  our  era  and  lived  for many  years  in  Rome,  dying  about  A.D.  180, after  his  return  to  Jerusalem.  He  is  reputed  the father  of  Church  History,  from  his  having compiled  an  account  of  happenings  in  it,  tracing the  succession  of  Popes  from  St.  Peter  to  his own  day.  The  work  is  unfortunately  lost, but  it  is  warmly  commended  by  St.  Jerome  and by  Eusebius,  who  knew  it.  There  is  no  proof at  all  that  St.  Hegesippus  was  (as  is  sometimes advanced)  a  Judaizing  Christian. HELANUS  (St.)  (Oct.  7)  
(6th  cent.)  The  tradition  at  Reims,  where his  festival  is  kept,  is  that  St.  Helanus  came  to France  in  the  sixth  century,  with  his  six  brothers and  three  sisters,  who  thenceforth  lived  separately, the  one  from  the  other,  an  Eremitical  life, on  the  banks  of  the  River  Marne.  St.  Helanus, who  was  a  priest,  presided  over  them  and ministered  to  the  people  of  the  neighbourhood. He  appears  to  have  survived  till  after  a.d.  600. HELENA  (St.)  V.  (May  22)  
(5th  cent.)  Mentioned  in  the  Acts  of  St. Amator,  Bishop  of  Auxerre,  as  a  saintly  maiden, endued  with  the  grace  of  working  miracles. She  assisted  at  the  deathbed  of  the  holy  Bishop (A.D.  418).  More  is  not  known  of  her. *HELENA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  24)

She  was  canonised  by  Pope Alexander  III  (A.D.  1164). HELENA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  13)  

See  SS.  CENTOLLA  and  HELENA. HELENA  (HELEN)  (St.)  Empress.  (Aug.  18)  

Widow.  

(4th  cent.)  Traditionally  St.  Helena  has  for centuries  been  looked  upon  as  a  native  of Britain ;  but  modern  writers  hold  to  the  view that  she  was  by  birth  an  Asiatic.  Married  to Constantius  Chlorus  (afterwards  colleague  of the  Emperor  Maximian  Herculeus),  she  bore him  at  York  a  son,  Constantine,  destined  to be  the  first  Christian  Emperor.  Helena  did not  become  a  Christian  until  after  the  peace  of the  Church  (A.D.  313).  She  spent  the  rest  of her  life  in  the  East  and  in  Rome,  where  she  died about  A.D.  328,  having  passed  her  days  in  works of  piety  and  charity.  She  had  a  memorable share  in  the  Discovery  of  the  Cross  on  which Our Lord  suffered, and in building up  the 
132 

Holy  Places  of  Jerusalem.  Part  of  her  relics 
are  in  France,  part  have  been  retained  in  Rome.  

HELICONIDES  (St.)  M.  (May  28)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  woman,  native  of Thessalonica,  who  was  arrested  at  Corinth and  beheaded  after  excruciating  torture  (a.d. 244)  under  Gordian,  or  more  probably  (a.d.  250) in  the  Decian  persecution. *HELIER  (St.)  M.  (July  16)  
(6th  cent.)  A  native  of  Tongres  (Limburg), who  lived  as  a  hermit  in  the  Island  of  Jersey, and  was  put  to  death  by  a  band  of  heathen pirates,  whom  he  was  endeavouring  to  convert to  Christianity. HELIMENAS  (St.)  M.  (April  22)

St.  Heliodorus,  with  seven  others,  appears  to have  suffered  in  Africa ;  but  St.  Ambrose claims  the  greater  part  of  the  rest  for  his  own city  of  Milan. HELIODORUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  3)  
(4th  cent.)  Born  in  Dalmatia,  probably at  the  same  place  and  about  the  same  time (A.D.  332-A.D.  342)  as  St.  Jerome,  he  was  through life  the  intimate  friend  and  confidant  of  the famous  Doctor  of  the  Church.  He  helped  him, financially  and  otherwise,  in  the  preparing  of the  Vulgate.  He  made  two  pilgrimages  to  the East  in  company  with  St.  Jerome,  and  on  his second  return  to  Italy  was  made  Bishop  of Altinum,  a  small  town  (since  destroyed),  not far  from  Venice.  He  assisted  at  the  Council of  Aquileia  (A.D.  381).  We  have  a  letter addressed  to  him  by  St.  Jerome,  written  in  the year  396 ;  but  the  exact  date  of  his  death  is unknown. HELIODORUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  28)  

See  SS.  MARCUS,  ALPHIUS, Ac. HELIODORUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM. (Nov.  21)  
(3rd  cent.)  Christian  Martyrs  who  suffered under  Aurelian  (A.D.  270-A.d.  274,  in  Pamphylia (Asia  Minor).  Some  of  their  executioners,  converted at  the  sight  of  their  patience  in  the torture  chamber,  are  said  to  have  declared themselves  Cliristians,  and  there  and  then  to have  shared  their  glorious  lot. HELLADIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  18)  
(7th  cent.)  A  distinguished  minister  of  the Visigothic  Kings  of  Spain,  at  the  Court  of Toledo,  who  embraced  the  Religious  life  in  a neighbouring  monastery.

St. Ildephonsus,  his  successor,  has  written  a  noble Panegyric  of  St.  Helladius. HELLADIUS  of  AUXERRE  (St.)  Bp.  (May  8)  
(4th  cent.)  The  predecessor  in  the  See  of 
Auxerre  in  France  of  St.  Amator,  whom  he

They  were  put  to  the torture  and  beheaded  as  Christians  at  Calahorra in  Old  Castile,  but  in  which  persecution  is unknown.  Prudentius  wrote  a  Hymn  in  their honour,  in  which  he  deplores  the  destruction by  the  Pagans  of  the  Acts  of  their  Martyrdom.

(12th  cent.)  An  Englishman,  a  missionary to  Sweden,  where  he  worked  under  the  protection of  the  holy  King  St.  Eric,  and  became  Bishop  of Upsala.  His  zeal  in  correcting  a  miscreant  led to  his  being  struck  down  somewhere  in  Finland by  the  dagger  of  an  assassin  (A.D.  1150),  and  to his  being  honoured  as  a  Martyr.  

♦HENRY  of  TREVISO  (Bl.)  (June  10)  
(14th  cent.)  A  holy  man  in  the  North  of Italy,  who  sanctified  himself  by  prayer,  fasting and  alms  deeds.  In  his  calling  as  an  uneducated labourer  he  persevered  until  his  death (A.D.  1315),  supporting  himself  by  the  toil  of his  hands.  He  passed  away  venerated  by  all, and  is  known  in  Italv  as  St.  Rigo.  

HENRY  (St.)  Emperor.  (July  15)

Descended  on  both  his  father's and  his  mother's  side  from  Charlemagne,  Henry, son  of  the  Duke  of  Bavaria,  was  born  A.D.  972, and  educated  by  St.  Wolfgang  of  Ratisbon. Elected  Emperor  (A.D.  1002)  and  crowned  in Rome  by  Pope  Benedict  VIII  (a.d.  1015), Henry  married  St.  Chunegunda,  making  however with  her  a  pact  of  life-long  continence. St.  Henry  was  a  sagacious  ruler  and  contrived more  or  less  to  maintain  peace  in  Germany  and in  Italy.  He  however  strenuously  and  successfully asserted  his  rights  against  the  powerful rebel  Ardoin.  He  fostered  the  commerce  of  his country,  giving  privileges  and  charters  to  the cities,  and  overawing  the  arrogant  feudal barons.  His  justice  tempered  with  mercy made  him  universally  popular.  He  respected the  rights  and  possessions  of  the  Church  and aided  the  Bishops  in  their  work  of  reform. After  a  long  and  prosperous  reign,  he  passed away,  July  15,  a.d.  1024,  and  was  buried  in the  Cathedral  at  Bamberg,  a  church  and Bishopric  he  had  himself  founded.

First Bishop of Aquileia near Venice.  He, 
with  his  deacon  Fortunatus,  was  beheaded  under

HERMAS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  9)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Roman  Christian,  disciple of 
St.  Paul  and  mentioned  by  him  in  his  Epistle 
to  the  Romans  (xvi.  14). The  Greeks  make  him 
Bishop  of  Philippi  and  honour  him  with  the 
133 

HERMAS 
title  of  Apostle.  Whether  he  ended  his  strenuous life  by  martyrdom  or  not  is  uncertain. By  mistake  some  have  attributed  to  him  the famous  work  entitled  "  Pastor  "  ;  but  it  was certainly  not  written  till  well  after  the  beginning of  the  second  century,  long  after  the  death  of this  St.  Hennas.  The  "  Hernias  Pastor  "  of the  book  is  another  personage  whose  name  does not  occur  in  our  Catalogues  of  Saints. HERMAS,  SERAPION  and  POLY^ENUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  18)  
(Date  unknown.)  Roman  Christians  who were  dragged  by  their  feet  over  rough  ground till  they  expired.

See  SS.  NICANDER  and  HERMAS. HERMELLUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  3)

He  has  been  in popular  veneration  at  Constantinople  from  the earliest  times,  and  is  commemorated  in  Bede's and  other  Western  Martyrologies.  In  these  he is  described  as  a  Martyr. HERMENEGILD  (St.)  M.  (April  13)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Visigothic  Prince,  son  of  King Leovegild,  and  brought  up  as  an  Arian  at  the Court  of  Seville.  He  was,  however,  converted to  Catholicism  by  the  holy  Bishop  St.  Leander. Upon  this  change  of  religion,  his  enraged  father cast  him  into  prison,  and  finally,  on  his  persistent refusal  to  receive  Communion  from  the hands  of  an  Arian  Bishop,  had  him  beheaded (A.D.  586).  His  brother  Recared  succeeded  their father  on  the  Visigothic  throne  ;  and  his  conversion brought  about  the  return  of  the  nation to  Faith  in  the  Blessed  Trinity. HERMENGAUDIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  3)  
(Date  unknown.)  Commemorated  as  Bishop of  Urgel,  a  small  mountain  town  of  Catalonia in Spain ;  but nothing authentic is extant concerning  him. HERMES,  AGG-ffiUS  and  CAIUS  (Jan.  4)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Commemorated  at  Bologna  in Italy,  where  their  relics  are  enshrined  and  where they  probably  suffered  under  Maximian Herculeus,  about  A.D.  300.  Some  Martyrologies place  them  in  Asia  Minor,  an  error possibly  due  in  part  to  the  Oriental  names  of two  among  them. HERMES  and  HADRIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (March  1) (3rd  cent.)  Christians  put  to  death  on account  of  their  religion  (A.D.  290)  under  the Emperor  Maximian  Herculeus  at  Marseilles. The  Liturgical  Lections  read  at  Marseilles  on their  festival  state  that  a  number  of  other Christians  suffered  with  them.  The  relics  of these  Martyrs  were  lost  in  the  troubles  of  the great  French  Revolution. HERMES  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  28)  
(2nd  cent.)  Roman  Martyrs  who  perished under  a  judge,  Aurelian  by  name,  between A.D.  110  and  A.D.  132.  They  are  mentioned  in the  Acts  of  Pope  St.  Alexander  I,  who  suffered at  that  period.  St.  Hermes  is  annually  commemorated in  the  Liturgy. HERMES  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  22)

Exorcists, who is believed to have suffered 
martyrdom  in  the  persecution  set  on  foot  by 
the Emperor Aurelian (A.D. 270-275).  Some 
say  that  St.  Hermes  was  put  to  death  while 
with  the  army  on  the  banks  of  the  Danube  ; 
others  assign  Bologna  as  his  place  of  martyrdom.  

HERMIAS  (St.)  M.  (May  31)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  veteran  soldier  who  suffered 
a  cruel  martyrdom  at  Comana  in  Cappadocia 
134 

(not  in  Pontus,  as  Baronius  thought)  under Marcus  Aurelius,  about  A.D.  170.  As  not unfrequently  happened,  the  courage  displayed by  St.  Hermias  inspired  some  of  his  executioners to  become  Christians.  He  has  a  prominent place  in  the  Greek  Liturgy. HERMILAND  (HERMENLAND)  (St.)  (March  25) Abbot.  

(8th  cent.)  Born  of  noble  parents  at  Nimeguen  in  Holland,  or,  as  others  assert,  at  Noyon in  North-Eastern  France,  he  was  brought  up  as a  page  at  the  Court  of  Clotaire  III  (a.d.  656a.d.  670).  When  arrived  at  man's  estate  he entered  the  monastery  of  Fontenelle,  and, having  been  ordained  priest,  was  sent  to  Nantes, where  he  built  a  monastery  in  the  Island  of Aindre  in  the  Loire.  Of  this  he  was  made Abbot,  and  presided  over  it  for  many  years. His  death  is  usually  dated  A.D.  720.

residence  of  the Emperor Diocletian.  St.  

Hermolaus,  an  aged  priest,  having  succeeded

Imperial  physician,  was,  with  him,  condemned 
to death, racked, and beheaded. The two 
brothers,  Hermippus  and  Hermogenes,  shared 
their  martyrdom  (A.D.  300  about).  

HERMYLAS  and  STRATONICUS  (Jan.  13)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Hermylas,  a  deacon  of  Singudunum  (now  Belgrade),  and  Stratonicus,  his servant,  on  account  of  their  profession  of  the Christian  Religion,  were  denounced  to  the authorities  under  the  Emperor  Licinius,  put to  the  torture,  and  in  the  end  drowned  in  the River  Danube  (A.D.  315).  Three  days  later, certain  Ciiristians  charged  with  the  care  of  the remains  of  Martyrs  recovered  their  bodies  and honourably  interred  them  at  a  place  situated at  some  little  distance  from  the  city. *HERNAN  (St.)  (Sept.  15)  
(6th  cent.)  A  British  Christian  who  took refuge  in  Brittany  at  the  time  of  the  AngloSaxon  conquest  of  England.  He  lived  there  a holy  life  as  a  hermit,  at  a  place  called  Loc-Harn, after  him,  and  where  he  is  the  Patron  Saint of  the  village. HERODION,  ASYNCRITUS  and  PHLEGON 
(SS.)  MM.  (April  8)  
(1st  cent.) Herodion,  whom  St.  Paul  (Rom. 
HILARION

The  tradition  is  that all  three  became  Bishops,  Herodion  of  Patras, Asyncritus  of  Marathon  and  Phlegon  of  Hyrcania; and  that  all  three  were  done  to  death  by  the Pagans  at  the  instigation  of  the  Jews.  

HERO,  ARSENIUS,  ISIDORE,  and  DIOSCURUS (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  of  Alexandria  in  Egypt, who  suffered  in  the  persecution  of  Decius (a.d.  250).  They  were  burned  to  death  at  the stake.  But  it  is  related  that  Dioscurus,  a  boy, was  set  free  after  being  scourged,  through what  old  authors  describe  as  a  special  intervention of  Divine  Providence.

HERON  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  17)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Ignatius  of Antioch  and  his  successor  in  the  great  Syrian See.  During  his  twenty  years  of  Episcopate (a.d.  116-a.d.  136)  he  faithfully  imitated  the zeal  and  charity  which  had  distinguished  his master,  St.  Ignatius  ;  and  in  the  end,  like  him, won  the  Crown  of  Martyrdom.  Epistles  to and  from  St.  Ignatius,  bearing  the  name  of St.  Heron,  are  extant,  but  are  of  doubtful authenticity.

A  Roman  soldier  who received  the  Crown  of  martyrdom  at  Dorostorum  (Sillistria)  in  Moesia,  together  with the  veteran  St.  Julius,  under  a  certain  President called  Maximus,  it  is  supposed  about  a.d.  302. But  the  date  and  place  of  martyrdom  are  both doubtful.  Mysia  (Asia  Minor)  and  the  reign  of the  Emperor  Alexander  Severus  (a.d.  222-235) are  alternative  suggestions.

He  was  the  faithful companion  of  the  same  Saint  in  his  travels  in search  of  retreats  of  even  deeper  solitude  than the  waste  places  of  Palestine.  At  St.  Hilarion's death  (a.d.  371)  St.  Hesychius  conveyed  the remains  of  the  Saint  back  to  their  own  monastery in  the  Holy  Land,  where  he  some  years later  himself  fell  asleep  in  Christ.

(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  soldier  who,  during the  reign  of  the  persecuting  Emperor  Diocletian, on  proclamation  being  made  that  all  who  refused to  sacrifice  to  the  gods  were  to  be  treated  as being  unworthy  of  wearing  the  military  cingulum or  belt,  at  once  cast  his  own  away.  Sentenced to  death,  he  was  thrown  to  drown  in  the  River Orontes  (a.d.  303  about).

Hieronides  was  a  deacon  far  advanced  in  years. Leontius  and  Sarapion  were  brothers.  The name  Selesius  should  be  Seleucus. HIEROTHEUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  4)  
(1st  cent.)  The  tradition  is  that  St.  Hierotheus  was  an  Athenian,  an  Areopagite  and  a disciple  of  St.  Paul.  He  is  also  presented  as the  friend  and  teacher  of  St.  Denis  ;  and  is  said to  have  himself  in  course  of  time  become Bishop  of  Athens.  The  writings  which  bear the  name  of  St.  Denis  the  Areopagite  make mention  of  Hierotheus  in  several  places,  and refer  to  writings  of  his  on  Mystical  Theology. Among  the  moderns,  some  deny  his  very  existence, others  post-date  him  to  the  third  or fourth  century  of  the  Christian  era. *HIEU  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  2)

St.  Hilaria  was  the  mother  of  the  famous St.  Affra,  and  was  discovered  by  the  Pagans praying  in  a  little  building  erected  over  her daughter's  grave.  They  forthwith  heaped brushwood  around  it,  and  the  flames  consumed Hilaria  with  her  maid  servants.  The  other Martyrs  named  above  suffered  in  riots,  to  which the  mob  at  the  time  was  incited  by  the  powerful Pagan  influences  still  almost  everywhere  dominant in  the  West.  The  discovery  of  the  relics of  these  Martyrs  or  of  some  among  them  led to  the  annual  celebration  of  a  festival  in  their honour  at  Augsburg  on  Aug.  12. HILARIA  (St.)  M.

HILARION 
HILARION  (St.)  Abbot.  (Oct.  21)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  best  known  Palestinian Solitaries.  Born  near  Gaza  of  Pagan parents,  about  A.D.  292,  while  quite  young,  he sought  and  received  Baptism,  and  afterwards repaired  to  visit  St.  Antony  in  Egypt.  On  his return  to  Palestine,  finding  his  parents  dead, he  distributed  his  whole  fortune  to  the  poor  and retired  into  the  wilderness  on  the  borders  of Egypt,  being  even  then  only  fifteen  years  old. From  that  time  till  his  death  at  the  age  of eighty,  he  practised  most  severe  abstinence, eating  only  each  day  a  few  herbs  and  a  small piece  of  bread.  Overcoming  the  Evil  One  in many  a  hard  fight,  he  was  graced  in  an  eminent degree  with  the  gift  of  miracles,  more  especially for  the  deliverance  of  those  obsessed  by  the devil.  Disciples  soon  flocked  around  him,  and he  then  founded  many  monasteries  in  various parts  of  Palestine.  In  a.d.  357  he  visited  the tomb  of  St.  Antony,  who  had  just  passed  away, and  afterwards,  to  escape  from  the  crowds  who continually  thronged  about  him  seeking  the cure  of  their  maladies,  he  kept  travelling  from country  to  country.  He  visited  Egypt,  Sicily, Dalmatia,  and  finally  Cyprus,  where  he  died A.D.  371.  St.  Hilarion  is  commemorated annually  in  the  Liturgies  of  both  the  Eastern and  the  Western  Churches. HILARY  (HILARIUS)  (St.)  Bp.,  (Jan.  13)  

Doctor  of  the  Church.  

(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  famous  of  the defenders  of  the  Catholic  Faith  against  the Arian  heresy,  with  which  during  the  fourth century  the  East,  and  more  particularly  the Imperial  Court  of  Constantinople  was  infected. Born  of  noble  though  heathen  parents  at Poitiers,  St.  Hilary  studied  Rhetoric  and Philosophy,  gradually  coming  to  a  knowledge of  Christianity.  In  A.D.  353,  elected  Bishop  of Poitiers,  he  separated  from  his  wife  and  devoted himself  to  his  flock.  The  Arian  Emperor Constantius,  taking  umbrage  at  his  powerful defence  of  orthodoxy,  banished  him  to  Phrygia in  Asia  Minor,  where  he  wrote  his  famous  Treatise on  the  Trinity,  and  continued  to  combat Arianism  with  so  much  success  that  to  get  rid of  him  the  authorities  suffered  him  to  return to  his  Diocese  in  the  fifth  year  of  his  exile. At  Poitiers,  in  a  Synod  he  held  there,  and afterwards  at  Milan,  where  an  Arian  had  been intruded  as  Bishop,  he  went  on  battling  with heresy.  To  the  intense  grief  of  his  people,  he was  taken  from  them  by  death,  Jan.  13,  A.D. 368  or  369.  His  Feast  is  kept  on  the  following day  and,  by  command  of  Pope  Pius  IX,  as  that of  a  Doctor  of  the  Church. HILARY,  TATIAN,  FELIX,  LARGUS  and  DENIS (SS.)  MM.  (March  16)  
(3rd  cent.)  Hilary,  Bishop  of  Aquileia, and  Tatian,  his  deacon,  were  arrested  as Christians  and  tried  before  Beronius,  a  judge, in  the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Numerian.  They were  put  to  the  torture,  and  in  the  end,  with Felix,  Largus  and  Denis,  laymen,  beheaded A.D.  284. HILARY  (St.)  M.  (April  9)  

See  SS.  DEMETRIUS,  HILARY, &c. HILARY  of  ARLES  (St.)  Bp.  (May  5)  
(5th  cent.)  Of  a  noble  family  of  what  is  now Lorraine,  Hilary  was  born  about  A.D.  401,  and, thanks  to  his  natural  abilities,  gained  high office  in  the  local  administration.  His  friend aird  relative  St.  Honoratus,  who  had  retired  to the  Isle  of  Lerins,  by  his  tears  and  entreaties effected  St.  Hilary's  conversion  to  Christianity. The  latter  sold  all  his  estates  and  repaired  to Lerins,  where  probably  he  received  Baptism. Soon  after,  Honoratus,  having  become  Archbishop of  Aries,  summoned  Hilary  to  him. Though  the  latter  was  then  only  twenty-nine years  of  age,  he  succeeded  his  relative  in  the See  of  Aries,  then  the  most  conspicuous  in  Gaul. His  mode  of  life  was  most  penitential,  and  his charity  and  zeal  unbounded.  He  built  many 136 

monasteries  and  assisted  at  several  Councils. He  died  A.D.  449. HILARY  (HILARUS,  HILARIUS)  (St.) (Sept.  10) Pope.  

(5th  cent.)  Born  in  Sardinia,  he  was  promoted to  high  offices  in  Rome  by  St.  Leo  the Great,  who  sent  him  as  his  Legate  to  Ephesus for  the  Abortive  Council,  since  styled  the "  Latrocinium  "  (A.D.  449).  On  this  occasion, Hilary  strenuously  upheld  the  Catholic  Faith and  bravely  bore  up  against  the  persecution  of which  he  was  the  object.  In  461  or  462  he succeeded  St.  Leo  as  Pope,  renewed  the  anathemas pronounced  against  Nestorius,  Eutyches and  Dioscurus,  laboured  to  promote  Church discipline,  built  and  repaired  churches  in  Rome, and  proved  himself  in  every  way  worthy  of  his exalted  position.  He  died  a.d.  467,  or  perhaps A.D.  468. HILARY  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  27)  

See  SS.  FLORENTINUS  and  HILARY. HILARY  of  MENDE  (CHELY)  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  25) (6th  cent.)  Born  in  the  South  of  France  at Mende  (anciently,  Gavalius  or  Javoux)  he received  Baptism  when  come  to  man's  estate, and  lived  for  some  time  a  hermit's  life  on  the banks  of  the  River  Tarn.  Joined  by  others, he  built  a  monastery,  himself  retiring  however to  the  Abbey  of  Lerins  to  learn  thoroughly  the Rule  of  Monks.  On  his  return  he  was  made Bishop  of  Mende,  and  as  such  assisted  at  the Council  of  Clermont  (a.d.  535).  Few  particulars concerning  him  are  extant ;  but  he  appears to  have  passed  to  a  better  world  about  A.D. 540. HILARY  of  VITERBO  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  3)  

See  SS.  VALENTINE  and  HILARY. *HILDA  (St.)  V.  (Nov.  17)  
(7th  cent.)  The  famous  first  Abbess  of Whitby,  in  Yorkshire,  over  which  foundation she  was  placed  by  St.  Aidan.  She  was  a Northumbrian  Princess,  and  had  been  baptised when  a  child  by  St.  Paulinus.  She  was  indefatigable in  her  zeal,  and  her  counsel  was sought  even  in  regard  to  public  affairs  by  the great  men  of  her  time.  She  died  after  a  long and  painful  illness,  a.d.  680 ;  and  her  relics were  translated  to  Glastonbury. HILDEGARDE  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  17)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  a.d.  1098,  in  the  Lower Palatinate  (Germany),  she  took  the  veil  in  the Abbey  of  Mount  St.  Disibode.  Marvellous  for her  gifts  of  prophecy,  she  wrote  a  Book  of Revelations  which  received  the  approval  of St.  Bernard  and  of  Pope  St.  Eugenius  III. When  Abbess  of  the  monastery,  as  her  community had  grown  over-numerous,  she  removed with  some  of  the  Sisters  to  Mount  St.  Rupert near  Bingen,  where  she  died  a.d.  1179.  Her writings  have  come  down  to  us,  but  with  grave interpolations. *HILDEGUND  (St.)  Widow.  (Feb.  6)  
(12th  cent.)  A  noble  lady  in  Germany  who in  her  widowhood  entered  with  her  daughter the  Order  of  thePremonstratensians  and  founded the  monastery  of  Mehren,  of  which  she  was  the first  Abbess.  Her  wonderful  gift  of  prayer,  her lowliness  of  spirit,  her  patience  and  her  love  of the  poor,  led  to  her  being  venerated  as  a  Saint from  the  day  of  her  death  (a.d.  1118). *HILDELID  (St.)  V.  (March  24)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Abbess  of  Barking,  which monastery  she  governed  till  her  holy  death  at an  advanced  age  (a.d.  717).  Both  St.  Aldhelm and  St.  Boniface  bear  witness  to  her  eminent sanctitv. HILTRUDE  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  27)  
(8th  cent.)  A  high-born  maiden  of  Hainault, whose  parents  had  founded  a  monastery  at  a place  called  Lessies  on  their  estate  for  their son  Guntard.  The  young  man  had  resolved to  become  a  monk,  and  Hiltrude  similarly wished  to  take  the  veil  as  a  nun.  Though  her father  had  already  arranged  a  marriage  for  her, he  reluctantly  gave  his  consent,  and  she  retired 
HONORATUS 

to  a  cell  in  the  neighbourhood  of  her  brother's monastery.  There  she  led  a  life  of  prayer  and penance  till  her  holy  death  (A.i>.  785  about).

HIMERIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  17)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  hermit,  but  afterwards  a monk,  elected  by  the  people  of  Amelia  (Ameria) in  Umbria  (Italy),  to  be  their  Bishop.  He continued  his  monastic  austerities  to  the  day of  his  death,  and  was  renowned  for  his  charity to  all.  After  his  decease  many  miracles  were wrought  at  his  tomb.  His  body  was  translated to  Cremona  (a.d.  965).  This  date  is  sure,  but even  the  century  in  which  he  flourished  (possibly the  sixth)  is  uncertain.  

HIPPOLYTUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  30)  
(3rd cent.)  A Syrian Christian, a priest, 
converted from the errors of Novatus and 
afterwards put to death for the Faith at 
Antioch,  some  time  subsequent  to  a.d.  250.

See  SS.  FELIX,  SEMPRONIANUS, Ac.  

♦HIPPOLYTUS  GALANTINI  (Bl.)  (March  20)  
(17th  cent.)  A  layman  at  Florence  who, living  a  toilsome  life  as  an  artisan,  nevertheless succeeded  in  forming  a  congregation  of  men and  women,  devoted  to  the  instruction  of  the young,  and  which  became  the  model  of  many others.  He  died  a.d.  1619  ;  and  many  supernatural signs  attested  his  sanctity.  

HIPPOLYTUS,  CONCORDIA  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Roman  tradition,  set  forth in  the  Breviary  Lections  and  Martyrology, has  it  that  this  Saint  Hippolytus  was  a  Roman baptised  by  St.  Laurence.  Tried  thereupon for  his  life  before  the  Emperor  Valerian  (a.d. 254-a.d.  259)  in  person,  he  was  sentenced  to be  torn  in  pieces  by  wild  horses  as  in  the  myth was  his  namesake,  the  son  of  Theseus.  After St.  Hippolytus,  suffered  his  old  nurse  Concordia and  nineteen  other  Christians,  who  were beheaded  outside  the  Porta  Tiburtina  (Tivoli Gate)  of  Rome  and  buried  together  in  the neighbouring  Ager  Veranus  (now  the  Cemetery of  San  Lorenzo).  Some  moderns  make  of St.  Hippolytus  a  priest  of  great  age,  a  convert from  Novatianism  ;  others  confuse  him  with St.  Hippolytus,  Bishop  of  Porto  (Aug.  22) ; but  into  these  controversies  it  is  not  needful here  to  enter 
HIPPOLYTUS  of  PORTO  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  22) (3rd  cent.)  Many  and  contradictory  are  the accounts  given  of  this  St.  Hippolytus.  That traditionally  accepted  is  to  the  effect  that  he was  an  Arabian  by  birth,  a  disciple  of  St. Irenseus,  or,  which  is  more  probable,  of  Clement of  Alexandria ;  that  coming  to  Rome  he  was by  Pope  St.  Callistus  made  Bishop  of  the neighbouring  little  town  of  Porto  ;  and  that  he was  put  to  death  by  drowning  in  the  reign of  Alexander  Severus  (a.d.  222-a.d.  235). A  Paschal  Cycle,  or  table  for  calculating  the date  of  Easter,  and  other  works,  mostly  now lost,  came  from  his  pen ;  and  St.  Jerome, with  others  of  the  Fathers,  are  loud  in  his praises.  The  attempts  made  to  father  upon him  the  heretical  Treatise  entitled  "  Philosophoumena "  (written  in  the  third  century and  recovered  in  1842),  have  altogether  failed  ; and  the  theory  that  he  was  at  one  time  a Novatian,  or  even  an  Anti-Pope,  is  equally baseless.  The  modern  speculations  about  him literally  fill  volumes,  but  the  views  advanced are,  to  say  the  least,  purely  conjectural.

HIRENARCHUS,  ACACIUS  and  OTHERS  (Nov.  27) (SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  At  Sebaste  in  Armenia,  between A.d.  303  and  a.d.  311,  seven  Christian  women, having  bravely  gone  to  torture  and  death  rather 

than  burn  incense  to  idols,  Hirenarchus,  one  of the  officials  present,  professed  himself  likewise a  believer  in  Christ  and  shortly  afterwards shared  their  fate.  With  him  suffered  the priest  Acacius,  one  of  the  local  clergy.  

HOMOBONUS  (St.)  (Nov.  13)  
(12th  cent.)  Son  of  a  merchant  of  Cremona (Lombardy),  and  himself  engaged  in  trade, Homobonus,  who  was  married  to  a  pious woman,  practised  the  most  scrupulous  honesty throughout  his  life,  and  was  conspicuous  for  his charity  to  the  poor.  His  piety  was  such  that he  never  failed  to  assist  at  the  Midnight  Matins, common  in  his  time,  nor  to  attend  the  Daybreak Mass.  One  day,  during  the  Holy  Sacrifice,  he fell  prostrate  on  the  ground  and  was  picked  up dead  (A.d.  1197).  His  holy  life  and  the  miracles obtained  through  his  intercession  caused  his speedy  canonisation  in  a.d.  1198.  His  relics are  venerated  at  Cremona.  

♦HONESTUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  16)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  native  of  Nimes  in  France, ordained  priest  and  sent  into  Spain  by  St. Saturninus  to  preach  the  Gospel.  This  he  did with  much  fruit.  He  appears  to  have  suffered martyrdom  at  Pamplona  about  A.D.  270.  

HONORATA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  11)  
(5th  cent.)  The  sister  of  St.  Epiphanius, Bishop  of  Pavia,  and  a  nun  of  conspicuous sanctity.  She  was  dragged  into  captivity  by Odoacer,  King  of  the  Heruli,  when  invading Italy ;  but,  ransomed  by  her  brother,  she returned  to  Pavia,  where  she  died  about  A.D. 500. Many  miracles  attested  her  holiness.  

HONORATUS  of  ARLES  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  16)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  probably  in  the  actual Lorraine  of  a  Roman  Consular  family,  he renounced  Paganism  in  his  youth  and  travelled with  St.  Caprasius  to  Greece.  There  he  passed some  years.  Returning  to  France,  he  founded on  the  Mediterranean  islet  of  Lerins  the  famous Abbey  of  that  name  (A.D.  400  about).  In  A.D. 426  he  was  forced  to  accept  the  Archbishopric of  Aries,  in  which  dignity,  on  his  death,  three years  later,  he  was  succeeded  by  his  disciple St.  Hilary.  

HONORATUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  16)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  Abbot  of  the  first  half  of the  sixth  century,  founder  of  the  monastery  of Fondi  on  the  confines  of  Latium  and  Campania. Of  his  many  virtues  and  miracles,  St.  Gregory the  Great  gives  a  pleasing  account  in  the First  Book  of  his  Dialogues.  

HONORATUS  of  MILAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  8)  
(6th  cent.)  The  successor  (a.d.  567)  of St.  Auxanus  in  the  See  of  Milan,  which  he governed  with  tact  and  firmness  in  the  troubled times  of  the  disputes  about  the  "  Three  Chapters," and  of  the  consequent  Schism.  The Lombards  then  overrunning  the  North  of  Italy drove  him  and  many  of  his  flock  into  exile  ; and  he  appears  to  have  died  at  Genoa  (a.d.  570). His  relics  are  at  Milan.  

HONORATUS  (HONORE)  of  AMIENS (May  16) (St.)  Bp.  

(7th  cent.)  All  the  information  regarding this  St.  Honoratus  which  has  come  down  to our  times  is  that  he  was  born  at  Ponthieu, where  also  he  died,  that  he  was  Bishop  of Amiens  some  time  in  the  seventh  century, and  that  his  people  honoured  him  as  a  Saint from  the  time  of  his  decease.  It  is  from  him that  a  well-known  church  (St.  Honore)  and thoroughfare  in  Paris,  take  their  name.  

HONORATUS  of  VERCELLI  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  28) (5th  cent.)  Born  at  Vercelli  (about  a.d.  330) and  educated  by  the  Bishop  St.  Eusebius,  he embraced  the  monastic  state.  Later,  he  shared the  exile  of  his  master  to  Scythopolis  (a.d.  355), and  also  probably  attended  him  in  his  wanderings through  Cappadocia,  Egypt  and  Illyricum. At  the  death  of  Limanius,  St.  Eusebius 's immediate  successor,  Honoratus  was  elected Bishop  at  the  recommendation  of  St.  Ambrose (a.d.  396).  In  the  following  year  St.  Honoratus

(6th  cent.)  Alleged  to  have  been  descended from  the  old  Emperors  of  the  East.of  the  dynasty of  Constantine,  he  was  ordained  priest  in  Rome and  lived  as  a  hermit  near  Brescia  in  Lombardy,  until  elected  Bishop  of  that  city.  He seems  to  have  died  in  the  year  586 ;  but nothing  is  really  known  now  about  him. HONORIUS  of  CANTERBURY  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  30)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Roman  monk  of  the  monastery founded  by  St.  Gregory  the  Great,  and  one  of the  missionaries  sent  to  England  with  St. Augustine.  In  630  (some  say  627)  he  succeeded St.  Justus  in  the  See  of  Canterbury,  and  was consecrated  thereto  by  St.  Paulinus,  Archbishop of  York.  He  received  the  pallium  with  many privileges  for  the  Church  of  Canterbury  from Pope  Honorius.  He  is  described  as  "  a  man of  most  holy  life,  well-versed  in  all  Ecclesiastical sciences."  He  passed  away  a.d.  653. HONORIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  21)

He  sent Envoys  to  the  Emperor  Anastasius  of  Constantinople and  succeeded  after  the  accession of  the  Emperor  Justin  in  putting  an  end  to  the Schism  between  the  Greek  and  Latin  Churches, caused  by  the  adhesion  since  A.d.  484  of  the Byzantines  to  the  errors  of  Eutyches.  St. Hormisdas  was  a  Prelate  distinguished  for  his ability,  clear-sightedness,  and  firmness.  He made  several  regulations  concerning  the Liturgy,  and  restored  and  enriched  many churches  in  Rome.  He  died  after  a  Pontificate of  nine  years  (a.d.  523).

♦HOUGHTON  (JOHN)  (Bl.)  M.  (May  4)  

See  CARTHUSIAN  MARTYRS.  

HUBERT  of  TONGRES  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  3)  
(8th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  a  nobleman of  Aquitaine,  employed  at  the  Court  of  Pepin of  Heristal.  While  hunting,  a  sport  of  which he  was  extremely  fond,  he  received  the  grace of  conversion.  He  then  placed  himself  under the  care  of  St.  Lambert,  the  Martyr-Bishop of  Maestricht,  who  ordained  him  priest,  and whose  successor  he  became.  He  translated St.  Lambert's  relics  and  See  to  Liege  (a.d.  727). Having  converted  many  idolaters  to  the  Faith and  wrought  several  miracles,  St.  Hubert  died in  that  same  year.  His  relics  were  enshrined in  the  ninth  century  in  the  Abbey  called  after him  in  the  Ardennes.  St.  Hubert  is  venerated as  Patron  Saint  of  hunters.  

♦HUDSON  (JAMES)  (Bl.)  M.  (Nov.  28)  

See  Bl.  JAMES  HUDSON.  

HUGH  of  GRENOBLE  (St.)  Bp.  (April  1)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  near  Valence  in  Dauphin6 (A.D.  1053),  he  entered  the  Ecclesiastical  state and  acquired  a  canonry  in  that  city.  Later, Hugh,  Archbishop  of  Lyons,  invited  him  to labour  in  his  Diocese.  In  a  Synod  held  at Avignon  (A.D.  1080)  he  was  appointed  Bishop of  Grenoble,  and  received  Episcopal  consecration in  Rome  at  the  hands  of  St.  Gregory  VII.  The Church  of  Grenoble  was  at  that  time  infected with  simony  and  usury  ;  but  St.  Hugh  rapidly reformed  its  discipline.  After  two  years  of Episcopate  he  repaired  to  the  monastery  of Chaise-Dieu  in  Auvergne,  where  he  remained for  one  year,  thence  returning  to  Grenoble  at the  Pope's  command.  He  allotted  to  St.  Bruno, Founder  of  the  Carthusians,  and  to  his  companions, the  desert  of  the  Chartreuse  for  their monastery.  After  forty  years  of  severe  physical and  moral  suffering,  a  holy  death  (a.d.  1132) closed  his  long  and  useful  Episcopate.  

HUGH  of  ROUEN  (St.)  Bp.  (April  9)  
(8th  cent.)  The  son  of  Drogo,  Duke  of Burgundy,  and  grandson  of  Pepin  of  Heristal (not  as  has  been  erroneously  surmised,  a  son  of Charles  Martel),  who  from  being  VicarGeneral of  Metz,  became  (a.d.  722)  Archbishop  of Rouen.  After  having  for  some  time  administered, together  with  his  own,  the  Dioceses  of Paris  and  Bayeux,  he  died  at  Jumieges  A.D.  730. In  the  ninth  century  his  relics  were  brought  to Aspre  in  Belgium,  to  save  them  from  profanation at  the  hands  of  the  Norman  invaders  of  the North  of  France.  

HUGH  (St.)  Abbot.  *  (April  29)  
(12th  cent.)  A  scion  of  the  sovereign  house of  Burgundy,  educated  by  his  great-uncle, the  Bishop  of  Auxerre,  Hugh  entered  the monastery  of  Cluny  under  St.  Odilo,  and  made his  religious  profession  at  the  age  of  sixteen (A.D.  1039).  He  succeeded  St.  Odilo  in  1049, though  then  only  twenty-five  years  old.  Under him,  in  concert  with  his  friend,  Pope  St.  Gregory VII,  the  great  Benedictine  Reform  of  Cluny attained  to  the  apogee  of  its  splendour  and usefulness,  subjecting,  or  influencing  to  their good,  numerous  monasteries  throughout  Western Europe.  Hugh  was  perhaps  the  first  "  Father General,"  in  the  modern  sense,  of  a  Religious Order  in  the  Latin  Church.  He  built  at  Cluny the  stately  Abbey  Church,  the  most  spacious at  that  period  in  Christendom,  and  died  full of  merits  a.d.  1109  at  the  age  of  eighty-five.  

♦HUGH  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  27)  
(13th  cent.)  The  child,  nine  years  of  age, whom  the  Jews  were  accused  of  having  barbarously tortured  and  put  to  death  at  Lincoln in  hatred  of  Christianity  (A.D.  1255).  King Henry  III  conducted  the  judicial  investigation which  resulted  in  the  confession  of  their  guilt, made  by  the  murderers.  Many  miracles  justified the  popular  veneration  of  St.  Hugh  as  truly a  Martyr  of  Clirist. 
HYGINUS 

♦HUGH  FARINGDON  (Bl.)  M.  (Nov.  14)  
(16th  cent.)  The  last  Ahbot  of  Reading, distinguished  for  his  learning  and  piety,  who rejecting  the  spiritual  supremacy  claimed  by Henry  VIII  was  hanged,  drawn  and  quartered (a.d.  1539)  on  the  same  day  as  Bl.  ltichard Whiting  at  Glastonbury.  Two  zealous  monks, John  Rugg  and  William  Eynon  (Onion),  shared the  glory  of  his  martyrdom.  

HUGH  of  LINCOLN  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  17)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  in  Burgundy  (a.d.  1140) he  became  a  Regular  Canon,  but  at  the  age  of twenty  entered  the  Carthusian  Order,  of  which he  was  later  on  appointed  ProcuratorGeneral. King  Henry  II  of  England  begged  him  to undertake  the  government  of  the  Carthusian monastery  of  Witham  in  Somersetshire,  which he  soon  turned  into  a  very  nourishing  community. When  elected  Bishop  of  Lincoln (a.d.  1186)  he  had  so  completely  won  the respect  of  the  monarch  that  he  was  able  to reform  many  abuses  and  even  to  repress  the unjust  pretensions  of  that  capricious  Prince. Sent  by  King  John  as  Ambassador  to  King Philip  Augustus,  he  concluded  a  Treaty  of Peace  between  England  and  France  ;  but  died in  London  on  his  way  back  to  his  See  (a.d. 1200).  His  relics  were  conveyed  with  great pomp  to  Lincoln,  the  Kings  of  England  and Scotland  taking  part  in  the  carrying  of  the  bier.

See  SS.  DANIEL  and  FRANCISCAN  MARTYRS.  

♦HUMBERT  of  SAVOY  (Bl.)  (March  4)  
(12th  cent.)  The  Count  of  Savoy,  ancestor of  the  Royal  House  of  Piedmont,  whom  his descendants  have  taken  as  their  Patron  Saint. He  was  a  good  and  wise  monarch,  brave  and victorious  in  warfare,  a  lover  of  justice,  loyal to  the  Church  and  a  man  of  singular  piety. He  died  a.d.  1188  at  Chambery,  while  on  his way  at  the  head  of  his  troops  to  repel  an invasion  of  the  Emperor  of  Germany.  

♦HUMBERT  (St.)  (March  25)  
(7th cent.)  A French Saint, disciple of 
St.  Amandus,  who  attained  to  great  sanctity 
as  a  monk  of  Marolles  in  Flanders.  He  died 
A.D.  680.  

♦HUMBERT  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  20)  
(9th cent.)  The  East  Anglian  Bishop  who 
crowned  the  Martyr-King  St.  Edmund  and  who 
suffered  about  the  same  time  with  him  (a.d.  

870)  at  the  hands  of  the  heathen  Danes.  

HUMPHREY  (St.)  Hermit.  (Sept.  1)  

Otherwise  St.  ONUPHRIUS,  which  see.  

♦HUNA  (St.)  (Feb.  13)  
(7th  cent.)  A  monk  and  priest  at  Ely  under 
St.  Etheldreda,  whom  he  assisted  in  her  last 
moments, afterwards  retiring  to  a  hermitage 
in  the  Fens  where  he  died  about  a.d.  690.  

HYACINTH  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  10)  

See  SS.  ZOTICUS,  IREN^US,  &c.  

HYACINTH  (St.)  M.  (July  3)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Chamberlain  of  the  Emperor Trajan  at  Csesarea  in  Cappadocia.  Accused  of being  a  Christian,  he  was  cruelly  scourged  and thrown  into  prison  where,  being  given  no  food, but  such  meat  as  was  consecrated  to  idols,  he lingered  many  days  and  ultimately  died  of hunger  early  in  the  second  century.  

HYACINTH  (St.)  M.  (July  17)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Martyr  of  Amastris  in Paphlagonia  (Asia  Minor)  who,  for  having  cut down  a  tree  consecrated  to  an  idol,  was  put  to the  torture  by  the  Governor  of  the  Province, and  suffered  to  die  in  prison  of  the  wounds  he had  received.  

HYACINTH  (St.)  M.  (July  26)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Roman  Martyrology states  that  he  suffered  in  the  second  century under  the  Emperor  Trajan  ;  but,  though  his existence  is  certain,  the  Bollandists  pronounce his  Acts  to  be  quite  unreliable.  

HYACINTH  (St.)  (Aug.  16)  
(13th cent.)  Of an illustrious family of 

Silesia,  he  was  born  in  1185  near  Breslau  and, having  completed  his  course  of  studies,  became a  Canon  of  Cracow.  Repairing  to  Rome  with the  Bishop,  his  uncle,  he  met  the  great  St. Dominic,  whose  Order  he  joined.  After  six months  of  Novitiate  he  made  his  profession and  returned  to  his  own  country,  converting many  sinners  on  the  way.  Both  at  Cracow  and elsewhere  throughout  Poland,  he  induced  a great  number  of  indifferent  Cluistians  to  reform their  lives,  and  founded  monasteries  in  several places.  He  next  journeyed  through  Pomerania, Denmark,  Sweden  and  Norway ;  afterwards to  the  South  of  Russia,  where  he  penetrated as  far  as  the  Black  Sea.  In  a  third  journey  he founded  a  monastery  even  in  the  distant  and unlikely  city  of  Kieff.  After  two  years'  rest  at Cracow,  he  undertook  (a.d.  1231)  the  longest of  his  Apostolic  expeditions,  penetrating  into Asia,  where  he  reached  the  frontiers  of  Thibet, and  even  made  his  way  into  China.  He  was  an old  man  when  he  returned  to  Cracow,  where he  died  shortly  afterwards  (a.d.  1257).  St. Hyacinth  was  canonised  a.d.  1594,  and  his Feast  was  ordered  to  be  kept  throughout  the Western  Church. HYACINTH,  ALEXANDER  and  TIBURTIUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  9)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Roman  Martyrology, following  those  of  St.  Bede  and  others,  commemorates these  Martyrs  as  having  suffered at  some  place  in  the  Sabine  country,  about thirty  miles  from  Rome ;  but  we  have  no further  information  concerning  them. HYACINTH  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  11)  

See  SS.  PROTUS  and  HYACINTH. HYACINTH,  QUINTUS,  FELICIANUS  and 
LUCIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  29)  
(Date  unknown.)  Beyond  the  registering their  names  as  Martyrs  in  Lucania  (Southern Italy)  in  the  various  Martyrologies,  and  a casual  reference  to  St.  Hyacinth  in  the  Works of  St.  Gregory  the  Great,  ancient  authorities are  silent  concerning  them. HYACINTHA  of  MARISCOTTI  (St.)  V. (Jan.  30)  
(17th  cent.)  A  lady  of  Viterbo  (Central Italy),  born  a.d.  1585,  who  though  eager  to contract  marriage  and  to  enjoy  a  worldly  life, could  not  find  a  suitable  husband  and,  at  the age  of  twenty,  joined  the  Third  Order  of St.  Francis  in  a  convent  at  Viterbo.  Here, unhappily,  for  the  space  of  ten  years,  she  led  a life  of  great  tepidity,  until  an  illness  which brought  her  to  the  point  of  death  wrought  a salutary  change  in  her.  Thenceforth  she  gave herself  to  God.  The  penances  in  particular she  practised  are  almost  incredible.  Her  humility led  her  to  rejoice  in  any  sort  of  ill-treatment which  befell  her.  Her  prayers  and  good  counsel converted  many  sinners.  Almighty  God  bestowed upon  her  the  gift  of  miracle-working  to aid  her  in  her  efforts  for  the  salvation  of  souls. She  passed  away  after  twenty-four  years  of penance  (a.d.  1640),  and  is  venerated  as  the Patron  Saint  of  Viterbo.  She  was  beatified in  1726,  and  canonised  in  1807.
♦HYDROC  (St.)  (May  5)  
(5th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Llanhydrock (Cornwall) ; but  no  record  of  his  life  has  come down  to  our  time.
♦HYGBALD  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  18)  
(7th  cent.)  A  holy  Abbot  In  Lincolnshire  to 
whom  several  churches  are  dedicated.  Mention 
of  him  occurs  in  the  Lives  of  his  more  celebrated 
friends,  St.  Egbert  and  St.  Chad.  

HYGINUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Jan.  11)  
(2nd  cent.)  After  the  martyrdom  of  St. Telesphorus,  St.  Hyginus,  an  Athenian,  was elected  Pope.  Authors  do  not  agree  as  to  the precise  dates  of  his  accession  and  of  his  death. But  it  may  safely  be  asserted  that  his  Pontificate fell  during  the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Antoninus Pius,  that  is  between  a.d.  138  and  a.d.  161. a.d.  158  is  the  most  likely  of  the  dates  given of his martyrdom.  The struggles of the 
139 

HYMELIN 
Church  in  his  time  were  chiefly  with  the  Gnostic heretics.  He  excommunicated  Cerdo  and others  of  their  leaders.  The  heresy  itself,  a strange  compound  of  Oriental  superstition  and of  Metaphysical  imaginings,  has  died  out completely  and  makes  no  sort  of  appeal  to  the modern  mind,  though  it  evidently  fitted  in with  the  mentality  of  second  century  philosophers. St.  Hyginus  is  said  to  have  accurately regulated  the  gradations  of  rank  among the  clergy.  All  the  Martyrologies  style  him  a Martyr  and  say  that  he  was  buried  near  the bodv  of  St.  Peter.  

♦HYMELIN  (St.)  (March  10)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint, a  kinsman  of 
St.  Rumold.  He  died  in  Belgium  on  his  return 
from  a  journey  to  Rome.  His  shrine  at  Visse
nacken  is  a  noted  place  of  resort  of  pilgrims.  

HYPATIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  3)  

See  SS.  LUCTNIANUS,  CLAUDIUS, Ac.  

HYPATIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  17)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  in  Phrygia  of  pious  parents dining  the  reign  of  the  Emperors  Arcadius  and Honorius,  at  the  age  of  nineteen,  he  embraced the  life  of  a  solitary  in  the  wilds  of  Thrace. Later,  crossing  into  Bithynia,  he  joined  the community  of  the  monastery  known  in  history as  that  of  "  The  Oak."  He  restored  the  house from  the  state  of  semi-ruin  into  which  it  had fallen,  and  presided  over  it  as  Abbot  until  his death  (a.d.  450  about).  He  was  then  in  great repute  for  holiness,  and  had  attained  the  age of  eighty  years.  Miracles  in  life  and  after  death bore  witness  to  his  sanctity.  

HYPATIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  18)  

See  SS.  LEONTIUS,  HYPATIUS,  &c.  

HYPATIUS  and  ANDREW  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  29) (8th  cent.)  Hypatius,  a  monk,  and  Andrew, a  church  sacristan,  both  Lydians,  so  edified by  their  holy  lives  the  then  Bishop  of  Ephesus that  he  consecrated  the  one  a  Bishop  and ordained  the  other  a  priest.  They  suffered martyrdom  at  Constantinople  under  the Emperor  Leo  the  Isaurian,  after  bravely  enduring atrocious  tortures  in  defence  of  the  Orthodox belief  in  the  duty  of  honouring  holy  pictures. Their  bodies  were  thrown  to  the  hounds  to  be devoured  (A.D.  735).  

HYPATIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  14)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Gangra  in  Paphlagonia  (Asia  Minor)  who  attended  the  Council of  Nice  (A.D.  325),  and  was  a  prominent  defender in  his  time  of  the  Catholic  Faith.  While  on his  return  from  Nice,  he  was  attacked  by  a band  of  heretics  and  stoned  to  death.  

♦HYWYN  (St.)  (Jan.  6)  
(6th  cent.)  Probably  a  companion  of  St. Cadvan  in  his  return  journey  (a.d.  516)  from Brittany  to  Cornwall  and  Wales.  St.  Hywyn is  said  to  have  been  the  founder  of  Aberdaron (Carnarvon).  Several  churches  in  the  West  of England  known  as  St.  Owen's  or  St.  Ewen's possibly  have  him  for  their  Title-Saint. 

IA  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  4)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  la  was  a  Greek  woman,  a prisoner  in  Persia.  She  suffered  martyrdom  in that  country  after  enduring  frightful  torture under  the  persecuting  King  Sapor  (a.d.  360). The  Roman  Martyrology  commemorates  together with  this  holy  woman  some  nine  thousand Christian  captives  who  about  the  same  time laid  down  their  lives  for  Christ  in  Persia. *IA  (HIA,  IVES)  (St.)  (Feb.  3)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Irish  Princess,  sister  of  St. Ercus,  who  crossed  into  Cornwall  and  there suffered  martyrdom  at  Hayle.  The  date  given is  a.d.  450.  She  has  left  her  name  to  a  Cornish town. IAGO  (St.)  Apostle.  (July  25)  

The  Spanish  form  of  the  name  St.  JAMES.

♦IBERIUS  (IBAR,  IVOR)  (St.)  (April  23)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  missionaries  (SS. Kiaran,  Ailbne,  Declan,  &c),  who  are  by  many thought  to  have  preceded  St.  Patrick  in  the Apostolate  of  Ireland.  Others  hold  that  St. Ibar  was  ordained  by  St.  Patrick.  St.  Ibar preached  chiefly  in  Leinster  and  in  Meath.  

♦IDA  (Bl.)  V.  (April  13)  
(13th  cent.) A  Benedictine  nun,  born  near 
Louvain in Brabant, wonderful for  her gift 
of  prayer  and  graced  with  the  Stigmata.  She 
died  A.D.  1300.  

♦IDA  (St.)  Widow.  (Sept.  4)  
(9th  cent.)  A  noble  lady  of  the  Court  of Charlemagne,  who  sanctified  her  widowhood with  penance  and  a  life  of  prayer.  She  died at  Munster  in  Germany,  of  the  infant  Church of  which  country  she  was  a  bright  light.  

♦IDABERGA  (St.)  V.  (June  20)  

Otherwise  St.  EDBURGA,  which  see.  

♦IDDA  (St.)  Widow.  (Nov.  5)  
(12th  cent.)  A  noble  lady  in  South  Germany 
who  lived  a  holy  life  of  suffering  and  of  prayer, 
giving  herself  in  the  end  entirely  to  the  service 
of  God  in  the  Benedictine  Abbey  of  Fischingen.  

♦IDUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  14)  
(5th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Patrick,  by whom  he  was  baptised  and  appointed  Bishop of  Alt-Fadha  in  Leinster.  

IGNATIUS  of  ANTIOCH  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  1) (2nd  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Evodius, who  followed  St.  Peter,  and  thus,  the  third Bishop  of  Antioch,  one  of  the  most  illustrious of  the  Apostolic  Fathers.  He  was  surnamed Theophorus,  the  God-Bearer.  He  ruled  the Church  of  Antioch  for  forty  years,  and  comforted his  flock  during  the  persecution  of  Domitian.  Under  Trajan  he  himself  received  the crown  of  Martyrdom,  being  carried  to  Rome and  there  thrown  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the Amphitheatre  during  the  Public  Games  (a.d. 114,  probably,  though  some  contend  for  an earlier  date).  The  remains  of  St.  Ignatius, taken  to  Antioch,  were  afterwards  retranslated to  Rome.  We  have  seven  of  his  Epistles, invaluable  for  the  doctrinal  and  ascetical instruction  conveved  by  them.  

IGNATIUS  of  AFRICA  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  3)  

See  SS.  LAURENCE,  IGNATIUS, &c.  

IGNATIUS  of  LOYOLA  (St.)  (July  31)  
(16th  cent.)  The  Founder  of  the  Society  of Jesus.  Born  at  Loyola  in  the  Basque  Province of  Guipuzcoa  (Spain),  he  left  the  Royal  Court to  become  a  soldier  ;  but,  grievously  wounded at  the  siege  of  Pampeluna,  turned  on  his recovery  to  the  more  arduous  service  of  the Militant  Church.  For  this  he  prepared  himself by  a  Retreat  at  Our  Lady's  Monastery  of Monserrat,  leaving  there  his  sword  and  coming forth  armed  with  his  famous  Book  of  Spiritual Exercises.  He  set  about  his  studies  at  Paris, where  he  gathered  his  first  companions  and laid  the  foundations  of  his  Order.  This  was approved  by  Pope  Paul  III  and  by  the  Council of  Trent,  to  which  his  sons  were  of  invaluable help.  Its  mission  was  from  the  outset  the battling  with  Protestantism  and  the  stirring up  of  the  Faithful  to  a  higher  spiritual  life. Many  were  the  sinners  St.  Ignatius  himself recalled  to  God ;  manifold  the  works  of  piety and  charity  to  which  he  gave  an  impulse. Working  always  for  the  greater  glory  of  God, he  passed  away  in  Rome  in  the  sixtyfifth  year of  his  age,  with  the  name  of  Jesus  on  his  lips (July  31,  a.d.  1556),  and  was  buried  in  the Gesu,  chief  church  of  the  Society.  He  was canonised  by  Pope  Gregory  XV,  A.D.  1622.  

♦IGNATIUS  AZEVEDO  and  OTHERS  (July  15) (Bl.)  MM.  

(16th  cent.)  Forty  missionaries  to  Brazil, members  of  the  Society  of  Jesus,  whose  ship was  taken  by  another  commanded  by  a  bigoted Calvinist.  In  disposing  of  his  prisoners,  he gave  the  order  :  "As  for  the  Jesuits,  kill  them without  mercy.  They  are  going  to  Brazil  to 
INNOCENT 

disseminate  false  doctrines." The  Martyrs  were thereupon butchered pitilessly (a.d. 1570). The  detailed  account  published  is  from  the  pen of  an  eye-witness. IGNATIUS  of  CONSTANTINOPLE  (Oct.  23)  
(St.)  Bp.  

(9th  cent.)  Son  of  the  Byzantine  Emperor Michael  (who  was  driven  from  the  throne  by Leo  the  Armenian),  St.  Ignatius  was  born  at Constantinople  about  A.d.  799.  Successively a  Monk,  Abbot,  and  Priest,  he  was  elected Patriarch  a.d.  842.  His  uncompromising denunciation  of  the  vices  of  the  Court  raised up  many  enemies  against  him,  chief  among  them Bardas  Csosar,  uncle  of  the  dissolute  youth known  as  the  Emperor  Michael  the  Drunkard. In  the  end,  Ignatius  was  driven  into  exile  and his  See  usurped  by  Photius,  a  clever  but  ambitious and  unscrupulous  man.  With  Photius may  be  said  to  have  originated  the  Greek Schism,  which,  consummated  two  centuries later  by  Michael  Caerularius,  has  cut  off  the East  from  Catholic  Communion  for  nearly  a thousand  years.  St.  Ignatius  was  recalled to  Constantinople  after  nine  years  of  banishment by  the  Emperor  Basil  the  Macedonian, and  governed  his  Church  till  his  death  at  the age  of  eighty  (Oct.  23,  a.d.  878).  His  memory was  speedily  venerated  as  that  of  a  Saint  both in  the  East  and  in  the  West. ILDEPHONSUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  23)  
(7th  cent.)  A  learned  monk  and  Abbot  of Agli  near  Toledo,  who  became  Bishop  of  that city  in  A.D.  657,  and  died  nine  years  later. He  was  buried  in  the  church  of  St.  Leocadia, a  holy  Martyr  whom  in  life  he  had  always  specially honoured.  He  has  left  many  works,  among others  a  Treatise  on  "  Ecclesiastical  Writers," and  another  on  "  The  Spotless  Virginity  of  the Mother  of  God,"  which  have  earned  for  him, in  Spain  and  in  the  Benedictine  Order,  the honours  given  to  Doctors  of  the  Church. *ILLADAN  (St.)  Bp.  (June  18)  
(6th  cent.) An  Abbot  in  Ireland  of  Rathlibthien,  afterwards  a  Bishop.  St.  Aidus  was one  of  his  disciples. ILLIDIUS  (ALLYRE)  (St.)  Bp.  (July  7)  
(4th  cent.)  The  fourth  Bishop  of  Clermont (France)  who  flourished  in  the  fourth  century, dying  about  A.D.  385.  His  relics  are  in  the Abbey  of  St.  Allyre  in  Auvergne,  though St.  Gregory  of  Tours,  a  devout  client  of  St. Illidius,  seems  to  aver  that  in  his  time  they had  been  at  least  in  part  translated  to  Tours. *ILLOG  (St.)  Bp.

♦ILLTYD  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  7)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  famous  of  the Saints  of  ancient  Wales.  Having  abandoned his  career  as  courtier  and  minister,  he  embraced the  monastic  life  under  St.  Cadoc  at  Llancarvan, and  afterwards  himself  founded  the  great  Abbey of  Llan-llltut,  or  Llantwit,  whence  issued  SS. David,  Samson,  Pol-de  Leon  and  other  holy men.  There  is  a  tradition  that  St.  llltyd  died in  Brittany  (A.D.  470),  where  his  relics  are  still in  veneration.  In  South  Wales  his  Feast  is now  kept  on  Nov.  6. ILLUMINATA  (St.)  V.  (Nov.  29)  
(4th  cent.)  A  holy  maiden,  perhaps  a  Martyr, 
who  flourished  at  Todi  in  Italy  in  the  beginning 
of  the  fourth  century,  and  is  there  held  in  great 
veneration.  

ILLUMINATUS  (St.)  (May  11)  
(13th  cent.)  His  relics  arc  in  the  monastery of  St.  Catharine  at  San  Sererivo  in  the  Marches of  Ancona.  Some  say  that  he  was  a  Benedictine monk ;  others  that  he  was  a  disciple and  companion  of  St.  Francis  of  Assisi.  Probably there  were  two  holy  men  of  the  same  name who  flourished  during  the  thirteenth  century in  Central  Italy.  But  all  particulars  are lacking. 

♦IMELDA  (Bl.)  V.  (May  12)  
(14th  cent.)  An  Italian  Saint  of  the  Order of  St.  Dominic  in  the  Convent  of  which  Order at  Bologna  she  was  a  pupil.  Though  quite  a child,  she  by  her  fervour  and  innocence,  merited high  favours  from  Almighty  God,  and  among others  that  of  a  miraculous  First  Communion. She  died  A.D.  1333,  being  then  only  thirteen years  old. *IMELIN  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  10)  

Otherwise  St.  ^EMILIA N,  which  see. *INA  and  ETHELBURGA  (SS.)  (Sept.  8)  
(8th  cent.)  King  Ina,  one  of  the  most famous  of  the  sovereigns  of  the  Heptarchyv after  a  long  and  prosperous  reign,  retired  with his  Queen  Ethelburga  to  Borne,  where  they  in the  practice  of  penance  and  of  works  of  piety prepared  for  death.  King  Ina  died  a.d.  727. Miracles  are  said  to  have  been  worked  at  their tomb  :  but  Ina  and  Ethelburga  have  never been  formally  recognised  as  Saints. *INAN  (St.)  (Aug.  18)  

Otherwise  St.  EVAN,  which  see. INDALETIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  15)  

See  SS.  TORQUATUS,  CTESIPHON, &c. INDES,  DOMNA,  AGAPES  and  THEOPHILA 
(SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  28)  
(4th  cent.) A  group  of  Christians  who  in 
various  ways  suffered  torture  and  death  for 
their  Faith  at  Nicomedia,  the  residence  of  the 
persecuting  Emperor  Diocletian,  about  A.D.  303.  

♦INDRACT  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  5)  
(8th  cent.)  Indract,  a  descendant  of  Irish chieftains,  thirsted  for  penance  and  retirementAfter  years  of  a  solitary  life  as  a  hermit,  he journeyed  as  a  pilgrim  to  Rome.  On  returning through  England,  he  and  his  party,  among whom  was  his  sister  St.  Dominica  (Drusa), were  attacked  by  robbers  and  put  to  death  near Glastonbury.  The  precise  date  is  not  ascertainable. Their  relics  were  enshrined  in  the Abbey  Church  of  Glastonbury,  and  venerated as  those  of  Martyrs. *INDRACT  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  8)  
(5th  cent.)  The  legend  of  these  Saints  is  to the  effect  that  they  were  Irish  by  birth  and that,  coming  to  England  in  the  time  of  St. Patrick  (fifth  century),  they  lived  as  hermits near  Glastonbury,  and  lost  their  lives  at  the hands  of  Pagans.  It  is  certain  that  their  shrine in  Glastonbury  Abbey  was  in  high  veneration. But  very  possibly  they  are  no  other  than  the eighth  century  Saints  of  the  same  names  also honoured  at  Glastonbury,  and  whose  Feast was  kept  on  Feb.  5.

♦INNOCENT  (St.)  Bp.  (June  19)  
(6th  cent.)  A  zealous  Bishop  of  Le  Mans (France),  much  venerated  by  his  flock  both  in life  and  after  his  death  (a.d.  542)  in  the  fortyfirst  vear  of  his  Episcopate. INNOCENT  of  TORTONA  (St.)  Bp.  (April  17)  
(4th  cent.)  Born  of  Christian  parents  about A.d.  280,  at  the  age  of  about  twenty-two,  he was  (under  the  persecuting  edict  of  Diocletian) seized  and  scourged  on  account  of  his  religion  ; and  only  by  a  miracle  escaped  death.  When Constantine  had  given  peace  to  the  Church, Innocent  took  orders,  and  in  A.D.  325  was  consecrated Bishop  of  Tortona  in  Italy.  He  passed away  about  A.d.  347.

INNOCENT  V  (St.)  Pope.  (June  22)  
(13th  cent.)  Born  at  Tarentaise  in  Burgundy (A.D.  1245),  he  entered  the  Dominican  Order, and  acquired  great  fame  as  a  theologian  and  as a  preacher.  After  being  Archbishop  of  Lyons and  Cardinal  of  Ostia,  he  succeeded  Pope Gregory  XII  in  St.  Peter's  Chair.  He  died only  five  months  later  (A.D.  1276).  Leo  XIII authorised  the  continuance  of  the  veneration traditionally  paid  to  his  memory  as  to  that  of  a Saint,  and  ordered  his  name  to  be  inserted  in the  Roman  Martvrologv.  

INNOCENT,  SEBASTIA  (SABBATIA)  and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  4)  
(Date  unknown.)  Christian  Martyrs  who suffered  at  Sirmium  (Mitrovitz)  in  the  Balkans, at  a  date  and  under  circumstances  now  unknown. They  are  reckoned  as  having  been  thirty-two  in number.  

INNOCENT  I  (St.)  Pope.  (July  28)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  at  Albano  near  Borne, St.  Innocent  succeeded  St.  Anastasius  in  St. Peter's  Chair,  A.D.  402.  He  vainly  tried  to make  peace  between  the  weak  Emperor  Honorius and  Alaric,  King  of  the  Goths.  But  notwithstanding all  the  Pontiff's  efforts  and  courage, Alaric  sacked  Rome  (A.D.  410).  St.  Innocent confirmed  the  Acts  of  two  African  Councils against  the  Pelagians.  His  authority  was constantly  appealed  to  also  from  the  East,  as in  the  case  of  St.  John  Chrysostom.  persecuted at  Constantinople,  but  upheld  by  the  Holy  See. Pope  St.  Innocent  died  A.D.  417,  and  has  left valuable  laws  and  writings  on  Church  discipline.

INNOCENTS  (THE  HOLY)  MM.  (Dec.  28)  
(1st  cent.)  To  "  the  men  children  that  were in  Bethlehem  and  in  all  the  borders  thereof" killed  by  order  of  King  Herod  (Matt.  ii.  16), SS.  Irenseus,  Hilary,  Cyprian,  Augustine  and other  Fathers  give  the  title  of  Martyrs  ;  and  as such  they  have  from  the  beginning  been  commemorated in  all  Martyrologies  and  honoured liturgically  both  in  the  Eastern  and  in  the Western  Church.  Several  Oriental  Rites  keep the  Feast  of  Holy  Innocents  on  Dec.  29  ;  but Dec.  28  is  by  far  the  more  usual  date.  In  the West  a  singular  tradition  has  established  that the  Mass  of  Holy  Innocents  be  celebrated  like those  of  Advent  and  Lent,  without  Festal Chants.  Relics  of  the  Holy  Innocents  are venerated  in  many  churches.  

IPHIGENIA  (St.)  V.  (Sept,  21)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Virgin  converted  to  Christianity and  afterwards  consecrated  to  God  by  St. Matthew  the  Evangelist,  Apostle  of  Ethiopia. The  extant  Acts  of  St.  Matthew  are  however  so untrustworthy  that  no  reliance  can  be  placed on  the  particulars  given  therein  of  St  Iphigenia and  others  of  the  first  fruits  of  the  Gospel  in Ethiopia, 
IRAIS  (HERAIS,  RHAIS)  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  22) (4th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  maiden  of  Alexandria or  of  Antinoopolis,  who  seeing  a  number of  Christians  being  conducted  to  death  in  a boat  on  the  Nile,  proclaimed  herself  likewise to  be  a  believer  in  Christ,  and  asked  to  share their  fate.  Like  them  she  was  put  to  the  torture and  beheaded  (A.D.  300,  about).  

♦IRCHARD  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  24)  
(7th cent.)  An Apostle of the Picts and 
disciple  of  St.  Ternan,  born  in  Kincardineshire,

Rome  by  St.  Gregory  the  Great.

(3rd  cent.)  Christians  of  Thessalonica  who were  burned  at  the  stake  in  that  city  under Diocletian  and  Maximinian,  about  A.D.  300. IRENSEUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  28)  
(3rd  cent.)  Born  of  Christian  parents  in Asia  Minor  and  educated  by  St.  Polycarp,  the disciple  of  St.  John  the  Evangelist,  St.  Irenseus was  by  him  sent  as  a  missionary  into  Gaul, and  ordained  priest  by  St.  Pothinus,  Bishop  of Lyons,  whom  he  succeeded  as  Bishop  (A.D.  177). With  very  many  of  his  flock,  St.  Irenseus  appears to  have  suffered  martyrdom  under  Septimus Severus  (A.D.  202).  "  A  most  learned  and eloquent  man,  endowed  with  all  the  gifts  of the  Holy  Ghost,"  so  he  is  described  by  St. Epiphanius.  He  rendered  invaluable  services to  the  Popes  of  his  time,  combated  Gnosticism and  other  heresies  then  rife,  and  has  left  us several  treatises  to  which  appeal  is  constantly being  made  by  Theologians  and  Church  Historians. IRENjEUS  and  MUSTIOLA  (SS.)  MM.  (July  3) (3rd  cent.)  Irenaeus,  a  deacon,  and  Mustiola, a  matron  allied  by  marriage  to  the  Emperor Claudius  II,  were  scourged  to  death  at  Chiusi in  Tuscany  under  Aurelian  (a.d.  273).  The pretext  of  their  execution  was  their  having buried  the  bodies  of  other  Martyrs,  and  visited, to  comfort  them,  other  Christians  imprisoned for  their  Faith. IREN/EUS  and  ABUNDIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  26) (3rd  cent.)  Two  Roman  Martyrs  who  suffered under  Valerian  (a.d.  258)  in  the  same persecution  as  the  famous  St.  Laurence.  Their crime  was  the  having  sought  out  and  decently interred  the  bodies  of  other  Martyrs.  Irenaeus and  Abundius  were  done  to  death  by  being drowned  or  suffocated  in  the  public  sewers. IRENAEUS,  THEODORE,  ANTONY,  SATURNINUS,  VICTOR  and  OTHERS  (Dec.  15)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  Twenty-two  of  the  many  Christians put  to  death  in  the  persecution  under Valerian  (a.d.  258  about).  The  circumstance of  there  being  so  considerable  number  to  suffer together  probably  drew  special  attention  to them  on  the  part  of  their  fellow-Christians, and  ensured  them  special  mention  in  the Registers. IRENE  (St.)  V.M.  (April  5)  
(4th  cent.)  The  sister  of  SS.  Agape  and Chionia  who  followed  them  to  the  stake  at Thessalonica  (A.D.  304)  in  the  persecution  under Diocletian.  She  was  one  of  those  devoted Christians  who  at  the  cost  of  their  lives  succeeded in  concealing  and  preserving  for  posterity copies  of  the  Holy  Scriptures  and  other Sacred  Books,  the  destruction  of  which  was avowedly  a  primary  object  of  the  frightful persecution  at  the  end  of  the  third  century.

IRENE  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  20)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Portuguese  nun  murdered  in 
defence  of  her  chastity  (A.D.  653).  Her  body 
thrown into the  Tagus  was  miraculously 
recovered, and  the wonders wrought  at  her 
tomb  led  to  her  canonisation.  Her  shrine  is  at 
Santarem  (Sant  Irene),  the  ancient  Scalabris, 
which  takes  its  modern  name  from  the  Martyr.  

IRENION  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Gaza  in  Palestine 
who flourished in the time of  the Emperor 
Theodosius  the  Great,  and  passed  away  in  fame 
of  extraordinary  holiness  about  A.D.  389.  

IRMINA  (St.)  V.  (Dec.  24)  
(8th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  Dagobert  II, 
King  of  Austrasia.  Irmina  was  betrothed  to 
a  young  prince  of  the  Merovingian race,  but 
ISIDORE 

he  died  before  the  marriage  could  take  place. Irmina  thereupon  founded  a  convent  at  a  place called  Horren,  to  which  she  retired.  She  died (a.d.  710)  after  a  life  of  wonderful  piety  and charity.  Aided  by  St.  Irmina,  St.  Willibrord, the  Apostle  of  Frisia,  began  the  celebrated Abbey  of  Epternach.  

♦IRMGARD  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  4)  
(11th  cent.)  A  maiden  of  holy  life  in  Germany, famous  for  miracles  and  in  great  veneration at  Cologne.  She  died  about  A.D.  1100.  

ISAAC  (St.)  (April  11)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Syrian  monk  who  early  in  the sixth  century  fixed  his  habitation  near  Spoleto in  Umbria  (Central  Italy),  and  gathered  many disciples  around  him.  He  died  in  high  repute of  sanctity,  about  a.d.  550 ;  and  his  relics were  enshrined  at  Spoleto.  The  account  given of  him  in  the  Dialogues  of  St.  Gregory  the  Great is  our  chief  authority  for  his  many  miracles and  wonderful  gift  of  prophecy.  

ISAAC  (St.)  M.  (June  3)  
(9th  cent.)  A  nobleman  of  Cordova  who, having  occupied  a  municipal  post  of  some distinction,  left  the  world  to  embrace  the monastic  life.  After  three  years  of  seclusion, he  was  condemned  to  death  for  the  Faith  by the  Cadi  of  Cordova  under  the  Caliph  Abdurrahman II,  and  was  beheaded  a.d.  851.  His body  was  burned,  and  his  ashes  cast  Into  the Guadalquivir.

♦ISABEL  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  31)  
(13th  cent.)  A  French  Princess,  daughter of  King  Louis  VIII,  a  pious  and  cultured maiden,  who  refused  to  give  her  hand  to  the Emperor  of  Germany's  eldest  son  and  heir, in  order  to  consecrate  her  virginity  to  God. She  founded  a  monastery  of  Poor  Clares  near Paris,  where  she  died,  Feb.  22,  a.d.  1270.

massacre  was  followed  by  several  others  of  the 
same  sort  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  Red  Sea.  

ISAIAS  (St.)  Prophet,  M.  (July  6)  
(7th  cent.  B.C.)  One  of  the  Greater  Prophets and  writer  of  a  Book  in  the  Canon  of  Holy Scripture.  Tradition  tells  us  that  he  was  sawn in  two  (Hebr.  xi.  37)  by  order  of  King  Manasses of  Juda  (B.C.  68),  and  buried  under  an  oak  tree. His  tomb  was  still  recognised  in  the  fifth  century of  our  sera,  when  his  relics  were  enshrined in  a  Christian  church.  His  Feast  is  generally kept  in  the  East ;  but  also  in  some  churches of  the  West.  

ISAURUS.  INNOCENT,  FELIX,  JEREMIAS  and PEREGRINUS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  17)  
(Date  unknown.)  Athenian  Christians  of uncertain  date  who  during  one  of  the  persecutions had  concealed  themselves  in  a  cave  at Apollonia  in  Macedonia.  On  being  hunted down  they  were  put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded.  

♦ISBERGA  (St.)  V.  (May  21)  
(9th  cent.)  The  Patroness  of  Artois  in Franco,  said  to  have  been  a  sister  of  the  Emperor Charlemagne,  and  perhaps  identical  with Gisclla,  also  daughter  of  Pepin  the  Short.  She was  a  nun  at  Aire  in  the  North  of  France,  and died  there  earlv  in  the  ninth  century.  

ISCHYRION  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM. (June  1)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Egyptian  and  an  officer  in 
the  Roman  army,  commonly  reputed  to  have 
suffered with five others in the persecution 

under  Diocletian  (A.D.  300  about).  But  the Bollandists  and  other  moderns  conjecturally identify  him  with  the  St.  Ischyrion  (Dec.  22), victim,  half  a  century  earlier,  of  the  persecution under  Decius. ISCHYRION  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Christian,  employed either  in  the  civil  or  in  the  military  administration of  the  province.  He  gave  his  life  for  his Faith  in  the  Decian  persecution  (a.d.  250).
♦ISIDORA  (St.)  V.  (May  1)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  nun  in  an  Egyptian monastery  who,  to  escape  the  being  honoured in  the  cloister,  fled  to  a  desert  hermitage,  and at  length,  as  St.  Basil  relates,  "  flew  to  Heaven as  a  bee  to  its  hive,  laden  with  the  honey  of good  works." ISIDORE  of  ANTIOCH  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Jan.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  put  to  death  at  Antioch 
by  the  Arians  some  time  in  the  fourth  century.  

The  name  of  his  See  and  other  particulars  are 
unknown.  

ISIDORE  of  NITRIA  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  Mentioned  by  St.  Jerome  as "  a  holy  venerable  Bishop  who  had  welcomed him  to'  Egypt."  This  St.  Isidore  appears  to have  passed  away  at  a  very  advanced  age towards  the  close  of  the  fourth  century.  Some think  that  he  is  identical  with  St.  Isidore  of Pelusium  ;  others  that  he  is  the  "  Isidore  " whose  successor  was  ordained  by  Theophilus  of Alexandria. ISIDORE  (St.)  (Jan.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  priest  and  ascetic, the  spiritual  father  of  more  than  a  thousand monks,  the  friend  and  supporter  of  St.  Athanasius  and  later  of  St.  John  Chrysostom.  He played  a  notable  part  in  the  controversies  of  his time,  and  underwent  much  unjust  persecution at  the  hands  of  Theophilus  of  Alexandria. Palladius  enlarges  much  on  his  virtues  and  on his  eminent  holiness  of  life.  He  died  at  an advanced  age,  shortly  after  a.d.  400. ISIDORE  of  PELUSIUM  (St.)  (Feb.  4)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Egyptian,  a  monk  from  his youth,  and  afterwards  Superior  of  a  monastery he  had  founded  at  Pelusium.  Though  often embroiled  in  the  controversies  of  his  time,  he was  in  great  and  general  esteem  both  as  a theologian  and  as  a  guide  of  souls.  What  have remained  of  his  letters  are  remarkable  for clearness  in  the  statement  of  doctrine,  and  for elegance  of  diction.  He  died  A.D.  449  or  A.D. 450  at  an  advanced  age. ISIDORE  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  5)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  St.  Isidore,  Martyr,  commemorated on  Feb.  5,  is  now  generally  identified with  the  Martyr  of  the  same  name  whose Feast  is  kept  on  May  15.  He  is  variously  known as  "  of  Alexandria  "  (his  birthplace),  or  "  of Chios  "  (the  place  of  his  martyrdom).  Hence the  confusion  in  the  Registers.  He  suffered under  Decius,  a.d.  250. ISIDORE  of  SEVILLE  (St.)  Bp.,  (April  4)  

Doctor  of  the  Church.  

(7th  cent.)  Born  of  a  noble  family  of Carthagena  in  Spain,  St.  Isidore,  with  his brothers,  Leander  and  Fulgentius,  and  his sister,  Florentia,  have  all  become  canonised Saints.  St.  Isidore  succeeded  St.  Leander  as Bishop  of  Seville  in  a.d.  600 ;  presided  over several  Synods,  and  thoroughly  reorganised the  Spanish  Church,  then  just  emerging  victorious from  its  struggle  with  Arianism.  He was  versed  in  all  the  science  of  his  age  ;  and  his extant  works  are  voluminous  and  of  great value,  rangine  in  their  subject-matter  from Grammar  to  History,  Theology  and  Ascetics. He  died  A.D.  636,  his  last  act  having  been  the distributing  of  all  his  goods  and  moneys  among the  poor. ISIDORE  (St.)  M.  (April  17)

ISIDORE 
St.  Isidore  passed  his  life  as  a  labourer,  marrying a  wife  as  fervently  pious  as  he  himself  was. He  died  May  15,  A.D.  1170,  at  the  age  of  sixty  ; and  his  body  remaining  incorrupt  was  fresh evidence  of  his  sanctity.  Of  him  it  was  said  : "  In  life  his  hand  was  ever  on  the  plough  ; his  heart  ever  blessed  with  the  thought  of God."  Pope  Gregory  XV  canonised  him  A.D. 1622.  He  is  the  Patron  Saint  of  the  city  of Madrid.  

ISIDORE  (St.)  M.  (May  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Egyptian  soldier  who,  with his  troop,  crossed  from  Alexandria  to  the  Island of  Chios,  and  was  there  tortured  and  beheaded as  a  Christian  under  Decius  (A.D.  250).  The well  into  which  his  body  was  thrown  is  famed for  miracles  wrought  by  water  drawn  from  it. This  St.  Isidore  is  almost  certainly  one  and  the same  with  the  St.  Isidore  of  Feb.  5.

(6th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Teilo,  and  by him  consecrated  Bishop.  The  fact  that  several Welsh  churches  are  dedicated  to  him  bears witness  to  the  universal  belief  in  his  sanctity of  those  who  knew  him  or  who  lived  shortly afterwards.

(7th  cent.)  Daughter  of  an  Irish  chieftain in  the  present  County  of  Waterford,  St.  Ita early  in  life  resolved  on  consecrating  herself to  God  in  the  Religious  state.  She  encountered much  opposition,  but  having  at  last  received the  veil,  she  founded  the  famous  monastery of  Hy-Connall,  near  Limerick.  She  was  the friend  and  adviser  of  SS.  Brendan,  Colman  and other  holy  men,  and  is  called  the  "  Second St.  Brigid  "  or  the  "  St.  Brigid  of  Munster." A.D.  650  is  given  as  the  date  of  her  passing  from this  world.  

♦ITHAMAR  (St.)  Bp.  (June  10)  
(7th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Paulinus  at Rochester,  by  birth  an  Anglo-Saxon,  and  thus the  first  of  our  native  Bishops.  He  died  A.D. 671 ;  and  several  churches  were  dedicated  to him.  

♦ITTA  (IDUBERGA)  (St.)  Widow.  (May  8)  
(7th  cent.)  The  wife  of  Pepin  of  Landen, Mayor  of  the  Merovingian  Royal  Palace.  She was  the  mother  of  St.  Begga  and  of  St.  Gertrude, to  whose  monastery  of  Nivelles,  when  left  a widow,  she  retired,  and  where  she  died  a  holy death  (a.d.  652).  

IVAN  (St.)  Hermit.  (June  24)  
(9th  cent.)  A  holy  hermit  in  Bohemia  who preferred  his  solitary  cell  to  the  brilliant  position offered  to  him  at  Court.  He  died  A.D.  845,  and was  reverently  interred  near  his  hermitage,  by the  care  of  St.  Ludmilla,  the  saintly  Duchess  of Bohemia.

♦IVO  (St.)  Bp.  (April  24)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Saint  said  to  have  been of  Persian  nationality,  but  who  is  of  uncertain history.  He  came  to  England,  it  is  alleged,  at the  end  of  the  sixth  century,  and  lived  in Huntingdonshire.  Miracles  wrought  at  his tomb  bore  witness  to  his  sanctity  ;  and  his body  was  solemnly  enshrined  in  Ramsey  Abbey (April  24,  A.D.  1001).  The  town  of  St.  Ives  in Huntingdonshire  takes  its  name  from  him.  

IVO  (YVO)  (St.)  (May  19)  
(14th  cent.)  A  Breton  Saint,  the  Patron  of lawyers.  Born  near  Treguier  (a.d.  1253),  he 144 

studied  at  Paris  and  Orleans,  and  all  his  life practised  law  in  his  native  city.  His  gratuitous services  to  the  oppressed  and  needy  earned  him the  title  of  "  Advocate  of  the  poor."  Orphans and  widows  he  treated  as  his  most  important clients.  He  was  above  all  a  man  of  prayer  and penance.  He  died  a.d.  1303,  and  was  canonised a.d.  1347,  many  miracles  having  been  proved to  have  been  attributable  to  his  advocacy  with Almighty  God.  

♦IVO  of  CHARTRES  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  23)  
(12th  cent.)  A  Canon  Regular  in  France, distinguished  by  his  learning,  as  by  his  piety and  zeal  in  God's  service.  He  reluctantly received  consecration  at  Rome  as  Bishop  of Chartres  from  the  Pope,  Blessed  Urban  II. His  long  Episcopate  was  chiefly  notable  for  the untiring  war  he  waged  against  abuses  in  Church discipline,  and  for  his  strenuous  upholding  of the  rights  of  the  Holy  See,  against  the  usurpations of  the  monarchs  of  the  period.  He  died a.d.  1115.

♦JACUT  and  GUETHENOC  (SS.)  (Feb.  6)  
(5th  cent.)  Two  brothers,  disciples  of  St. Budoc,  and  like  him,  driven  by  the  Saxons  from Great  Britain,  their  own  country.

JAMES  THE  HERMIT  (St.)  (Jan.  28)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Syrian  Solitary  of  the  sixth century  who  passed  fifteen  years  in  a  cave  on a  slope  of  Mount  Carmel  in  exercises  of  penance and  fervent  piety ;  but  from  over-trust  in himself,  at  the  end  of  that  period,  yielded  to the  temptations  of  the  flesh,  and  fell  into  heinous sins,  incurring  even  the  guilt  of  homicide. Yet  God's  mercy  came  to  him  as  to  King David  ;  and  for  the  ten  years  he  survived, repentant  and  humbled,  he  ceased  not  to deplore  the  evil  that  he  had  done.  He  redoubled his  austerities,  and  in  the  end  attained to  true  and  high  sanctity,  to  which  many miracles  bore  witness.  

♦JAMES  of  SCLAVONIA  (St.)  (April  20)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Franciscan  Friar,  native  of Dalmatia,  who  lived  a  most  holy  life  in  a convent  near  Bari  in  the  South  of  Italy.  He died  there,  A.D.  1485.  Many  miracles  have been  worked  through  his  intercession.

JAMES  THE  LESS  (St.)  Apostle.  (May  1)  
(1st  cent.)  St.  James,  the  brother  (that  is, the  cousin)  of  Our  Lord,  one  of  the  Twelve, and  the  writer  of  a  Canonical  Epistle,  was known  as  James  the  Just,  and  from  his  youth upwards  led  a  life  of  extreme  austerity.  After the  Ascension  he  was  appointed  Bishop  of Jerusalem,  and  his  repute  of  sanctity  became so  great  that  people  thought  themselves  happy if  thev  could  but  touch  the  hem  of  his  garment. When  ninety-six  years  old  he  suffered  martyrdom at  the  hands  of  the  Jews,  who  cast  him down  from  a  pinnacle  of  the  Temple.  He  died praying  that  his  enemies  might  be  forgiven (A.D.  61).  His  relics  are  enshrined  in  Rome with  those  of  his  fellow-Apostle,  St.  Philip.

♦JAMES  of  STREPA  (Bl.)  Bp.  (June  1)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Franciscan  Friar  of  Polish nationality,  afterwards  Archbishop  of  Lemberg, in  Galicia,  famous  for  his  love  of  God  and  zeal for  souls.  He  died  a.d.  1411,  and  was  beatified by  Pope  Pius  VI,  a.d.  1790.  

JAMES  of  NISIBI  (St.)  Bp.  (July  15)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  Fathers  of  the  Council of  Nicaea  (a.d.  325).  He  was  celebrated  for his  learning  and  for  the  gift  of  miracles  which Almighty  God  had  bestowed  upon  him.  He was  a  strenuous  upholder  of  the  Orthodox  Faith against  the  Arians.  A  Syrian  by  birth,  he became  Bishop  of  Nisibi  in  Mesopotamia.  He had  been  imprisoned  in  his  youth  as  a  Christian under  Galerius,  colleague  of  Diocletian,  early in  the  fourth  century  ;  but  survived  through  a long  and  useful  Episcopate,  passing  to  his reward  in  a  good  old  age,  a.d.  350.  

JAMES  THE  GREATER  (St.)  Apostle.  (July  25) (1st  cent.)  The  son  of  Zebedee  and  Salome, and  brother  of  St.  John  the  Evangelist,  called with  him  to  the  Apostolate  by  Our  Lord.  From the  Acts  of  the  Apostles  (xii.  2)  we  know  that he  was  the  first  of  the  Twelve  to  give  his  life for  his  master,  being  "  killed  with  the  sword  " by  King  Herod  Agrippa  (A.D.  43).  Of  his  work during  the  ten  years  preceding  we  know  little, save  what  tradition  has  handed  down  of  his journey  to  Spain  and  short  Apostolate  in  that country,  of  which  from  time  immemorial  he has  been  honoured  as  the  Patron  Saint.  His body  was  translated  to  Spain,  and  his  shrine at  Compostella  is  one  of  the  most  famous  places of  pilgrimage  in  the  Christian  world.  

JAMES  THE  HERMIT  (St.)  (Aug.  6)  
(6th  cent.)  By  birth  a  Syrian.  He  led  a solitary  life  about  A.D.  500  in  the  environs  of Amida  (Diarbekir)  in  Mesopotamia.  The  fame of  his  austerities  and  miracles  attracted  the admiration  and  esteem  of  the  King  of  Persia, at  that  time  Sovereign  of  the  country.  On  that monarch  promising  to  grant  him  any  favour  he might  ask,  St.  James  only  requested  that  mercy should  never  be  denied  to  any  who  pleaded for  it  at  the  King's  hand.

JAMES  INTERCISUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  27)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Persian  nobleman  of  high rank,  who  having  weakly  apostatised  to  keep the  favour  of  King  Yezdegird,  but  being  afterwards converted  anew  by  the  prayers  of  his mother  and  wife,  bravely  atoned  for  his  guilty weakness  by  undergoing  a  fearful  martyrdom (a.d.  421)  in  defence  of  the  Christian  Religion, under  Varanes  V,  successor  of  Yezdegird.  The Roman  Martyrology  adds  that  with  him  there suffered  also  in  Persia  a  vast  multitude  of Christians.  St.  James  is  surnamed  "  Intercisus  " (cut  to  pieces),  because  fingers,  toes,  then  feet and  hands,  legs  and  arms,  were  successively cut  off  his  still  living  body.  He  is  greatly honoured  throughout  the  East,  but  less  known in  the  West.  

JAMES  of  PICENUM  (St.)  (Nov.  28)  
(15th  cent.)  This  Saint  is  commonly  called St.  James  of  the  Marches  of  Ancona,  the  modern name  of  the  ancient  Picenum,  in  which  he  was born.  Though  his  family  was  of  the  poorest, his  talents  opened  a  bright  worldly  future before  him.  But  he  elected  to  put  on  the Franciscan  habit  at  Assisi,  and  thenceforth lived  a  wonderful  life  of  penance  and  poverty. His  zeal  for  the  salvation  of  souls  (says  Butler) seemed  to  have  no  bounds,  and  for  forty  years together  he  never  passed  a  single  day  without preaching  the  Word  of  God,  either  to  the people  or  to  the  Religious  of  his  own  Order. He  worked  miracles,  and  shared  in  some  of  the missionary  labours  of  St.  John  Capistran  in Germany.  He  died  a.d.  1476  at  the  age  of ninety,  and  was  canonised  a.d.  1726. 

♦  JAMES  HUDSON  (Bl.)  M.  (Nov.  28)  
(16th  cent.)  A  native  of  Yorkshire,  who  had studied  at  Reims,  and  there  been  ordained priest.  He  returned  to  England  and  forthwith did  his  utmost  to  make  known  the  truth  of  the Catholic  Faith  to  his  fellow-countrymen.  After one  year  of  missionary  labour,  he  was  seized  and condemned  to  death.  On  the  morning  of  his Martyrdom  he  loudly  declared  that  to  be  the most  joyous  day  of  his  life.  He  suffered  at York,  a.d.  1582.  His  name  is  sometimes  given as  James  Thompson. *JANE  of  VALOIS  (Bl.)  (Feb.  4)  
(16th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  Louis  XI  of France  and  wife  of  Lewis,  Duke  of  Orleans, afterwards  King  Louis  XII.  She  was  divorced by  him,  or  rather  her  husband  obtained  a decree  of  nullity  of  marriage  against  her  on  the ground  that  he  had  married  her  under  constraint from  her  father.  Jane  then  gave  herself  up  to the  doing  of  works  of  piety  and  charity,  until her  death  (a.d.  1506).  Some  years  previously she  had  founded  the  Institute  of  nuns  known  as the  Annonciades,  and  had  herself  taken  the religious  habit  among  them. *JANE  MARY  BONOMO  (Bl.)  V.  (March  1)  
(17th  cent.)  A  Benedictine  nun  of  Bassano in  North  Italy,  remarkable  for  her  sublime prayer  and  for  her  patience  in  suffering.  She died  a.d.  1670  at  the  age  of  sixty-four.  She was  beatified  by  Pope  Pius  VI  a  little  over  a century  later. JANE  FRANCES  (St.)  Widow.  (Aug.  21)  
(17th  cent.)  Jane  Frances  Fremiot,  born  at Dijon  in  Burgundy  (Jan.  23,  A.d.  1575),  was early  married  to  the  Baron  de  Chantal,  a nobleman  of  rank  equal  to  her  own ;  but losing  him  through  a  fatal  accident  while hunting,  she  thenceforth  gave  herself  up entirely  to  a  life  of  prayer  and  of  works  of charity.  In  the  year  1610,  guided  and  encouraged throughout  by  her  friend  and  spiritual father,  St.  Francis  de  Sales,  she  founded  the Order  of  Nuns  of  the  Visitation,  which  quickly spread  in  France  and  neighbouring  countries. St.  Jane's  last  years  were  passed  in  the  enduring of  intense  suffering  of  body  and  mind.  She went  to  her  rest  at  Moulins,  Dec.  15,  a.d.  1643. Her  remains  were  translated  to  Annecy  in  Savoy, the  cradle  of  her  Order.  There  she  rests  near St.  Francis,  in  the  crypt  of  a  stately  church. JANUARIA  (St.)  M.  (March  2)

Considering  the wholesale  and  systematic  destruction  of  all Christian  writings  which  more  than  once  took place  before  the  final  fall  of  the  African  Church, and  seeing  how  completely  that  Church  was wiped  out,  it  is  remarkable  that  we  know  as much  concerning  it  as  we  do.

The  body of  St.  Januarius  (San  Oennaro)  was  buried  in the  church  of  Naples,  of  which  city  he  has become  the  Patron  Saint.  The  yearly  liquefaction of  some  of  his  blood  preserved  in  a phial  is  a  well-known  miracle,  and  has  resulted in  the  conversion  of  countless  sinners  to  a  better life.

(16th  cent.)  Twenty-six  holy  men,  early missionaries  and  converts  in  Japan,  where shortly  before  St.  Francis  Xavier  had  introduced Christianity.  Among  these  twenty-six, St.  Philip  of  Jesus  (Las  Casas)  is  the  first named.  Some  of  them  were  European  missionaries (Franciscans  and  Jesuits),  the  others natives  of  the  country.  They  were  the  first  in Japan  to  shed  their  blood  for  Christ,  being  by order  of  the  Emperor  Taicosama,  crucified  near Nangasaki,  a.d.  1597.  They  were  canonised by  Pope  Pius  IX  (a.d.  1862).  Subsequently to  their  death,  the  Church  of  Japan  was  all but  extinguished  in  the  blood  of  its  hundred thousand  Martyrs. *JARLATH  (HIERLATH)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  1)  
(5th cent.)  One of St. Patrick's saintly disciples.  He  succeeded  St.  Benignus  in  the See  of  Armagh  (a.d.  468),  and  appears  to  have passed  away  a.d.  481. *JARLATH  (St.)  Bp.  (June  6)

Among  his  disciples were  St.  Brendan  of  Clonfert  and  St.  Colraan of  Cloyne.  He  died  Dec.  26,  a.d.  540. *JARMAN  (GERMAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Jnlv  3)  
(5th  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  the  Isle  of Man,  sent  thither,  it  is  said,  by  St.  Patrick. Kirk-Jarman,  near  Peel,  marks  the  place  of his  sepulchre. JASON  (St.)  (July  12)  
(1st  cent.)  In  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles (xvi.  16)  he  is  described  as  "  one  Mnason,  a Cyprian,  an  old  disciple."  The  word  Mnason was  gradually  corrupted  into  Nason,  and  later into  Jason.  He  appears  to  have  always  been venerated  by  the  Church  and  by  the  Christian people  as  a  Saint ;  but  nothing  is  now  known about  his  life  and  work. JASON  (St.)  M.

(6th  cent.  B.C.) The  second  of  the  Greater 
Prophets,  and  the  inspired  writer  of  a  Canonical 
Book  of  Holy  Scripture,  to  which  is  appended 
another  entitled  the  Lamentations  of  Jeremias

that at  the  age  of  fifty-five  he  was  stoned  to 
death  at  Taphnes  in  Egypt  (B.C.  590)  bv  the  I

JEROME  (HIERONYMUS)  ^EMILIANI  (Feb.  8) (St.)  
(16th  cent.)  The  Founder  of  a  Congregation of  Regular  Clerks,  vowed  to  the  care  of  orphan children,  and  known  as  Somaschi,  from  the little  town  in  the  Venetian  territory  where  they began  their  work  of  charity,  St.  Jerome,  born at  Venice  of  noble  parents,  in  his  youth  served in  the  army  of  the  Republic.  Taken  prisoner, he  was  miracuously  set  free  after  having  had recourse  to  the  intercession  of  Our  Blessed Lady.  He  then  gave  himself  up  wholly  to exercises  of  piety  and  to  works  of  charity,  in which  he  persevered  to  the  day  of  his  holy death  (Feb.  8,  A.D.  1537),  he  being  then  in  his fifty-seventh  year.  He  died  of  a  contagious malady  caught  while  tending  the  sick.  His Order  was  approved  by  Pope  St.  Pius  V,  and he  himself  was  canonised  by  Pope  Clement XIII,  who  appointed  July  20  as  his  Festival Day.  

JEROME  (HIERONYMUS)  (St.)  (Sept.  30)  

Doctor  of  the  Church.  

(5th  cent.)  Born  at  Stridonium  in  Dalmatia, St.  Jerome  studied  in  Rome,  visited  the  then chief  centres  of  learning  in  Gaul  and  in  Greece, and  became  the  most  erudite  scholar  of  his  age. Retiring  into  the  Desert  of  Syria,  he  continued to  divide  his  time  between  prayer  and  study, though  not  without  exercising  a  helpful  influence on  the  Church  affairs  of  the  period.  Repairing to  Rome  and  ordained  priest,  he  became  the confidant  and  adviser  of  Pope  St.  Damasus, at  whose  death  he  returned  to  the  East.  There, attended  by  the  cultured  Roman  ladies,  Paula and  Eustochia,  he  settled  at  Bethlehem,  where he  passed  away,  Sept.  30,  a.d.  420.  His  life was  one  of  troubles  and  vicissitudes,  but sanctified  by  assiduous  prayer  and  unremitting toil.  His  body  is  enshrined  at  St.  Mary  Major's, in  Rome.  He  is  famous  for  his  compilation  of the  great  Vulgate  edition  of  the  Bible,  which is  that  authorised  down  to  our  own  times  by the  Church.  It  is  partly  an  original  translation from  the  Hebrew,  partly  a  revised  text  of  the Vetus  Italica,  or  primitive  Latin  version  of the  Scriptures,  and,  taken  as  a  whole,  is  assuredly the  most  reliable  authority  on  the  genuine text  that  has  remained  to  us. *  JEROME  and  SIMON  (Bl.)  MM.  (Dec.  5)  
(17th  cent.)  Blessed  Jerome,  a  Jesuit missionary  to  Japan,  after  twenty-two  years  of toil,  was  betrayed  to  the  Pagan  persecutors  of the  Christian  religion  and  burned  to  death  at Tokio,  with  a  native  Christian,  Simon  Jempe, his  disciple  (Dec.  5,  A.D.  1623). JOACHIM  (FATHER  OF  THE  BLESSED  VIRGIN MARY)  (St.)  (March  20)  
(1st  cent.)  Other  forms  of  the  name  Joachim appear  to  be  Eliacim,  and  perhaps  the  Heli  of St.  Luke's  Gospel  (iii.  23).  But  Joachim  is traditional,  and  is  used  by  early  writers  like St.  Epithanius.  The  cultus  of  St.  Joachim  is immemorial  in  the  East.  In  the  West  it  seems to  have  been  introduced  in  the  sixteenth century,  since  which  time  popular  devotion to  the  Saint  has  become  universal.  Liturgically, the  Feast  of  St.  Joachim  was  long  celebrated on  the  Sunday  within  the  Octave  of  the  Assumption. It  is  now  assigned  to  August  16.  Of the  holy  man's  life,  nothing  whatever  has  been revealed  to  us  ;  and  the  legends  recorded  in the  various  Apocryphal  Gospels  are  so  distorted as  to  be  quite  unreliable.  That  he  was  the husband  of  St.  Anne  and  father  of  Our  Blessed 
JOHN 

Lady are reasons amply sufficient for the prominence he has obtained in the worship of  the  Catholic  Church. JOACHIM  (St.)  (April  16)  
(14th  cent.)  Born  at  Siena  of  the  noble family  of  the  Pelicani,  when  fourteen  years  old, he  received  the  Religious  Habit  of  the  Servite Order  at  the  hands  of  St.  Philip  Benizi.  As a  Religious,  he  excelled  in  every  virtue,  above all  in  humility,  which  in  him  was  so  dominant that  he  never  could  be  prevailed  upon  to  suffer himself  to  be  promoted  to  the  priesthood. His  devotion  to  the  Blessed  Virgin  was  boundless and  lifelong.  He  died  at  Siena  (A.D.  1305)  at the  age  of  forty-six. JOAN  of  ARC  (THE  MAID  OF  ORLEANS)  
(St.)  V.  (May  30)  
(15th  cent.)  Jeanne  d'Arc,  a  peasant  girl, born  at  Domremy  in  Lorraine  (A.D.  1411),  was distinguished  from  childhood  for  her  virtues and  singular  piety.  While  watching  her  flock of  sheep  she  ever  sought  union  with  God ;  and was  by  Him  raised  to  those  high  degrees  of prayer  which  seem  reserved  to  but  few  even  of His  Saints.  In  Joan's  time,  France  was  torn by  Civil  War,  and  in  great  part  subject  to  the English  King,  Henry  VI.  In  repeated  visions of  Angels  it  was  shown  to  Joan  that  she  was to  be  instrumental  in  freeing  and  pacifying  her Fatherland.  She  was  directed  herself  to  take up  arms  in  its  defence,  and  to  lead  the  French soldiers  to  victory.  The  compelling  the English  Generals  to  raise  the  siege  of  Orleans, and  the  conducting  Charles  VII  of  France  in triumph  to  his  Coronation  at  Reims,  were  her chief  achievements.  But  (as  she  herself  had predicted)  Joan  was  to  be  betrayed  and  to  die in  the  accomplishment  of  her  work.  Taken prisoner,  she  found  herself  at  the  mercy  of  the English  and  Burgundians.  The  Bishop  of Beauvais  presided  over  the  Court  which  condemned her  to  death,  mainly  on  the  pretext that  she  had  donned  man's  attire  and  had  fought in  defence  of  her  country.  Every  other  charge brought  against  her  utterly  broke  down.  She was  unjustly  condemned  to  death  and  burned at  the  stake  at  Rouen,  May  30,  A.D.  1431.  Her last  words  were  the  Name  of  Jesus  thrice repeated.  Within  a  very  few  years  the  Ecclesiastical Courts  annulled  the  judgment  of  the B  is  hop  of  Beauvais  ;  and  the  more  the  history of  the  Holy  Maid  has  since  been  looked  into, the  more  clearly  has  the  genuineness  of  her Divinely  inspired  mission  been  shown.  After the  lapse  of  nearly  five  centuries,  the  Catholic Church  has  formally  canonised  the  "  Maid  of 
OrlpAns  " 
JOANNA  (St.)  Widow.  (May  24)  
(1st  cent.)  The  wife  of  Chuza,  housesteward  of  King  Herod  Antipas.  She  was  one of  the  holy  women  who  accompanied  Our  Lord in  his  journeyings  and  who  brought  spices  and ointments  to  the  Sepulchre  on  Easter  morning (Luke  viii.  3 ;  xxiv.  10).  Nothing  more  is known  concerning  her.  The  Greeks  and Armenians  honour  her  on  their  Festival  of "  The  Holy  Ointment  Bearers." 
JOANNICIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  4)  
(9th  cent.)  A  native  of  Bithynia  in  Asia Minor,  who  after  serving  as  a  soldier,  retired  to a  solitary  place  near  Mount  Olympus  and  embraced the  life  of  a  hermit.  Pursued,  however, by  popular  veneration,  he  often  changed  his abode.  He  was  endued  in  a  high  degree  with the  gifts  of  prophecy  and  of  miracles  ;  and was  a  strenuous  opponent  of  the  Iconoclast heretics.  He  died  at  the  age  of  ninety-four (a.d.  846),  and  his  memory  is  greatly  honoured, especially  among  the  Greeks  and  Sclavonians.  

♦JOAVAN  (St.)  Bp.  (March  2)  
(6th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  a  native  of Ireland,  educated  in  Britain,  and  a  companion of  St.  Paul  de  Leon  in  Armorica,  where  he became  that  Saint's  successor  as  Bishop.  He passed  away  about  A.D.  562.  His  tomb  is  still 

in  great  veneration  and  his  Festival  Is  kept liturgically  in  Brittany.  

JOB  (St.)  Patriarch  (May  10)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  man  "  simple  and upright,  and  fearing  God  and  avoiding  evil  " (Job.  i.  1),  of  whose  "  patience  "  we  are  reminded that  "  we  have  heard "  (St.  James  v.  11) that  patience  forming  the  text  of  a  Canonical Book  of  Holy  Scripture.  It  is  likely  that  he flourished  about  B.C.  1500.  His  name  is inserted  in  all  the  Western  Martyrologies,  though his  public  cultus  chiefly  obtains  in  the  East.  

♦JODOC  (JUDOC,  JOSSE)  (St.)  (Dec.  13)  
(7th  cent.)  Son  of  Hoel,  King  of  Brittany, and  brother  of  St.  Judicael.  To  escape  from succeeding  to  his  father's  throne,  he  fled  to  the territory  now  called  Picardy,  and  after  many years  of  Eremitical  life,  died  near  Montreuii, about  A.D.  675.  

JOEL  (St.)  Prophet.  (July  13)  
(8th  cent.  B.C.)  One  of  the  Twelve  Minor Prophets.  He  prophecied  in  the  Kingdom  of Juda  about  the  same  time  as  Osee  in  that  of Israel.  Apart  from  what  we  read  in  the  Canonical Book  of  Holy  Scripture  containing  the record  of  the  revelations  made  to  him,  we  have no  particulars  concerning  him.  His  body  is enshrined  under  the  High  Altar  of  the  Cathedral of  Zara  in  Dalmatia.  

JOHN  CAMILLUS  of  MILAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  10) (7th  cent.)  Surnamed  "  Bonus  "  (The  Good). The  Bishop  of  Milan  first  enabled  to  return  to his  Diocese  from  which  for  nearly  eighty  years the  Lombard  invaders  had  banished  his  predecessors. During  his  ten  years  of  Episcopate he  did  much  to  efface  the  traces  left  of  Ananism. His  rule  was  in  all  respects  firm  and  gentle. He  passed  away  A.D.  655,  and  in  death  as  in life  has  always  been  in  exceeding  honour  at Milan.  St.  Charles  Borromeo  (A.D.  1583) placed  his  relics  in  a  stately  shrine  in  the Cathedral.  

JOHN  of  RAVENNA  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  12)  
(5th  cent.)  The  Bishop  of  Ravenna  (A.D. 452-a.d.  494)  who  saved  his  flock  from  the fury  of  Attila  the  Hun,  and  mitigated  its  sad lot  when  the  city  was  taken  by  Theodoric, King  of  the  Ostro-Goths.  He  was  eminent for  the  energy  and  wisdom  of  his  government, and  by  his  prudent  counsel  greatly  aided  Pope St.  Gelasius  in  the  adapting  of  Church  discipline to  the  needs  of  that  age  of  barbarism.  

JOHN  CHALYBITA  (St.)  Hermit.  (Jan.  15)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  in  Constantinople  of  noble and  wealthy  parents,  when  about  twelve  years old  he  secretly  left  his  home  to  become  a  monk near  Jerusalem.  After  serving  God  manfully in  his  monastery  for  about  six  years  his  Abbot gave  him  permission  to  revisit  his  home.  On his  way  he  disguised  himself  as  a  beggar,  and his  mother,  not  knowing  him,  drove  him  from her  door.  He  thenceforth  subsisted  on  the charity  of  his  parents  in  a  little  hut  in  the neighbourhood,  spending  his  time  in  prayer and  good  works.  After  three  years,  Our  Lord visited  him  and  told  him  that  his  trial  was  over. John  then  sent  for  his  mother,  and  showing  her the  Book  of  the  Gospels  she  had  given  him  in childhood,  died  in  her  arms.  This  happened about  the  middle  of  the  fifth  century.  Some authors  transfer  to  Rome  the  scenes  of  the closing  years  of  this  Saint.

See  SS.  ANTONY,  MERULUS, <fec.  

JOHN  THE  ALMONER  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  23)  
(7th  cent.)  A  wealthy  citizen  of  the  Island of  Cyprus  who,  considering  the  death  of  his wife  and  two  children  as  a  call  from  God  to  the leading  of  a  more  perfect  life,  forthwith  gave away  in  alms  all  that  he  possessed,  and  devoted himself  to  a  life  of  prayer  and  good  works. His  fame  of  sanctity  led  to  his  being  elected Patriarch  of  Alexandria  (A.D.  608) ;  but  before taking  possession'of  his  See,  he  bade  the  officials to  briug  him  a  complete  list  of "  his  lords," 
147 

JOHN 
meaning  the  poor  of  the  city  ;  and  thenceforth provided  for  the  needs  of  the  seven  thousand five  hundred  thus  reported  to  him.  On  two days  of  each  week  he  attended  to  the  complaints of  all  who  believed  themselves  aggrieved,  nor would  he  suffer  his  servants  to  take  food  till all  wrongs  were  redressed.  All  injustice  was hateful  to  him,  and  he  was  implacable  against the  users  of  false  weights  and  measures.  It  is said  of  him  that  he  never  uttered  an  idle  word. In  Alexandria  he  left  seventy  churches  in  place of  the  seven  he  had  found  there.  He  died in  Cyprus,  his  native  island,  a.d.  619.  Throughout his  life  God  blessed  his  alms  by  multiplying his  gold  and  so  enabling  him  to  do  more  for  the poor  and  needy.  St.  John  of  Alexandria  has well  deserved  his  surname  of  Eleemosynarius (Alms-giver).
♦JOHN  of  ST.  OMER  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  27)  
(12th  cent.)  A  saintly  monk  of  French Flanders  raised  much  against  his  will  to  the Episcopal  See  of  Terouanne  or  St.  Omer.  He was  a  man  of  most  austere  life,  and  though gentle  and  kindly  in  his  dealings  with  others, effected  great  and  salutary  reforms  in  Church discipline.  He  died  at  a  great  age,  a.d.  1130. JOHN  CHRYSOSTOM  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  27)  

Doctor  of  the  Church.  

(5th  cent.)  Surnamed  Chrysostom  (GoldenTongued)  from  his  marvellous  and  persuasive eloquence.  A  Syrian  of  Antioch,  born  a.d.  344 and  trained  by  able  masters,  he  renounced  the all  but  certain  prospect  of  a  distin  .uished  public career  to  take  Holy  Orders.  After  leading  for some  time  the  life  of  an  Ascetic  or  Monk,  he  was ordained  priest  by  St.  Meletius  of  Antioch, and  became,  as  was  said,  "  the  eye,  the  ear, and  the  hand  of  his  Bishop."  Raised  on  account of  his  merit  (a.d.  397)  to  the  great  See  of  Constantinople, his  success  in  reforming  the  dissolute life  of  the  Eastern  Capital— one  of  the  glories  of his  life— while  it  endeared  him  to  his  flock,  raised up  against  him  powerful  enemies  in  the  Court of  the  weak  Emperor,  Arcadius — chief  among them,  the  Empress  Eudoxia.  Pretexts  were invented,  and  in  a  gathering  of  Bishops,  misnamed a  Synod,  Chrysostom  was  deposed  and banished  (a.d.  403),  in  defiance  of  the  Pope who,  as  was  to  have  been  expected,  strenuously espoused  his  cause.  The  Saint  died  in  exile, Sept.  14,  a.d.  407,  at  Comana  in  Cappadocia, of  the  hardships  he  had  been  made  to  endure. His  body  was  brought  back  to  Constantinople in  a.d.  434,  and  later  translated  to  St.  Peter's in  Rome.  His  noble  writings,  which  include  a revisod  Greek  Liturgy,  full  Commentaries  on Holy  Scripture,  a  Treatise  on  the  Priesthood, and  many  Homilies,  are  among  the  most valuable  of  those  we  owe  to  the  Fathers  of  the Church. JOHN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  28)  
(6th  cent.)  Styled  by  the  Roman  Martyrology  "  A  man  of  God."  Born  near  Langres  in France,  early  in  life  he  built  a  monastery  on  the banks  of  the  little  river  Reaume,  of  which  he became  the  Abbot.  His  death  is  placed  at about  A.D.  539. JOHN  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  31)  

See  SS.  CYRUS  and  JOHN.
♦JOHN  OF  THE  GRATE  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  1)  
(12th  cent.)  A  saintly  Bishop  of  St.  Malo  in Brittany,  the  father  of  his  people,  who  on  his holy  death  (a.d.  1163)  insisted  on  venerating him  as  a  Saint.  After  the  lapse  of  some centuries  Pope  Leo  X  sanctioned  their  devotion. The  expression  "  Of  the  Grate  "  merely  refers to  the  iron  grating  that  surrounded  the  shrine of  the  Saint.
♦JOHN  NELSON  (Bl.)  M.  (Feb.  3)  
(16th  cent.)  A  native  of  Yorkshire,  ordained priest  somewhat  late  in  life,  at  Douai.  His missionary  labours  barely  lasted  one  year. He  was  then  arrested  and  hanged  at  Tyburn (a.d.  1578)  for  refusing  the  oath  of  Queen Elizabeth's  Supremacy.  His  last  words  were  : 
148 

"  I  forgive  the  Queen  and  all  the  causers  of  my death." 
JOHN  of  MATHA  (St.)  (Feb.  8)  
(13th  cent.)  Born  in  Provence  (France) (A.D.  1169),  and  educated  at  Aix  and  Paris, John  of  Matha  renounced  rank  and  promise  of worldly  distinction  for  the  service  of  his  neighbour in  the  duties  of  the  priesthood.  A  vision at  his  first  Mass  determined  him  to  the  instituting, in  concert  with  St.  Felix  of  Valois,  of  the Order  of  the  Most  Holy  Trinity  for  the  Redemption of  Christian  Captives  held  in  slavery  by the  Moors  of  Africa.  For  this  purpose  he  betook himself  to  Barbary.  His  Order  grew  rapidly, and  was  approved  by  Pope  Innocent  III.  It still  exists.  The  Religious  are  robed  in  white and  wear  on  their  breasts  a  red  and  blue  cross. St.  John  died  in  Rome,  Dec.  21,  A.D.  1213.  

JOHN  JOSEPH  OF  THE  CROSS  (St.)  (March  5) (18th  cent.)  Carlo  Gaetano,  born  A.D.  1654, in  the  Island  of  Ischia,  off  the  coast  of  Naples, at  the  age  of  sixteen,  took  the  name  of  John Joseph  of  the  Cross  in  the  Alcantarine  or strictest  branch  of  the  Franciscan  Order.  His life  thenceforth  was  one  of  penance  and  suffering. As  Superior,  by  his  kind  considerateness he  won  the  hearts  of  all  his  brethren,  while  by his  skill  and  energy  he  propagated  and  consolidated his  Institute  throughout  Italy.  At  his word,  in  time  of  famine,  loaves  were  multiplied, and  food  and  herbs  sprang  into  being.  He  died at  the  age  of  eighty,  at  the  hour  he  had  predicted, March  5,  a.d.  1734.  He  was  canonised bv  Pope  Gregory  XVI  one  hundred  years  later.  

♦JOHN  BAPTIST  MACHADE  and  OTHERS 
(Bl.)  MM.  (Feb.  15)  
(17th  cent.)  Blessed  John  Baptist,  a  Portuguese Jesuit,  was  beheaded  at  Nangasaki  in Japan,  June  1,  A.D.  1617.  The  martyrdom  of numerous  other  Christians,  both  European  and native,  quickly  followed,  some  of  them  being crucified  head  downwards  like  St.  Peter  the Apostle.  

♦  JOHN  of  BRITTO  (Bl.)  M.  (Feb.  17)  
(17th  cent.) A  famous  Jesuit  missionary  and 
Martyr,  by  birth  a  Portuguese.  After  twenty 
years  of  toil  in  the  South  of  Hindostan  he  was 
put  to  death  for  the  Faith,  Feb.  4,  a.d.  1693.  

♦JOHN  THE  SAXON  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  22)  
(9th  cent.)  A  native  of  Friesland,  invited to  England  with  other  holy  and  learned  men  by King  Alfred,  and  made  Abbot  of  Athelingay in  Somersetshire,  where  his  zeal  for  the  restoration of  Religious  discipline  led  to  his  being struck  down  by  murderers  while  kneeling  in prayer  in  his  Oratory,  a.d.  895.  

♦JOHN  LARKE  (Bl.)  M.  (March  7)  
(16th  cent.)  A  venerable  priest,  ordained  at the  beginning  of  the  sixteenth  century,  and sometime  Rector  of  Chelsea,  where  Blessed Thomas  More  had  his  residence.  That  Martyr's death  so  wrought  upon  him  that  he  too  bravely underwent  imprisonment  and  suffering  for  the same  Sacred  Cause,  and  at  length  laid  down his  life  for  the  Faith  (a.d.  1544).  

JOHN  of  GOD  (St.)  (March  8)  
(16th  cent.)  The  Founder  of  the  Order  of Charity  for  the  Service  of  the  Sick.  A  native of  Portugal,  he  was  until  the  age  of  forty, by  turn  a  shepherd,  a  soldier  and  a  pedlar, settling  down  at  last  in  a  small  shop  at  Gibraltar. A  sermon  preached  by  St.  John  of  Avila,  the Apostle  of  Andalusia,  so  startled  him  that  he betook  himself  to  Africa  to  aid  and  comfort the  Christian  captives  held  in  slavery  by  the Moors.  Finally,  he  devoted  himself  to  the work  of  ministering  to  the  sick  ;  and  gathering others  about  him  began  an  Institute  which  in our  time  is  still  flourishing.  Ten  years  later (a.d.  1550)  he  died  of  an  illness  contracted  in the  service  of  his  neighbour,  expiring  while  on his  knees  before  the  Altar.  His  Order  was definitely  organised  in  a.d.  1570,  and  he, famous  for  many  miracles,  was  canonised a.d.  1690. 
JOHN 

JOHN  of  PINNA  (St.)  (March  19)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Syrian  by  birth,  but  an Italian  by  domicile,  he  settled  at  Pinna  in  the Abruzzi,  where  he  built  a  monastery  which  he governed  as  Abbot  for  forty  years.  He  lived in  the  sixth  century  and  was  famous  for  many supernatural  gifts  and  graces.  

JOHN  of  EGYPT  (St.)  Hermit.  (March  27)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Recluse  of  Lycopolis  in  the Thebaid  (Egypt),  to  whom  God  gave  a  remarkable grace  of  prophecy  in  witness  to  his  rare sanctity  of  life.  People  flocked  from  the  most distant  countries  to  see  and  consult  him — among them  Theodosius  the  Great,  to  whom  he  predicted his  victories  over  Maximus  (a.d.  388), and  over  Eugenius  (a.d.  394).  St.  John  died in  that  same  year,  394,  at  the  age  of  ninety. Many  miracles  were  wrought  by  his  intercession.  

JOHN  DAMASCENE  (St.)  (March  27)  

Doctor  of  the  Church.  

(8th  cent.)  The  last  of  the  Greek  Fathers, born  at  Damascus,  where  his  father  was  the Caliph's  Vizier.  He  was  educated  with  great care  by  Cosmas,  a  Greek  monk  who  had  been brought  into  Syria  as  a  slave.  On  his  father's deatli  he  succeeded  him  as  Vizier,  and  had  thus all  that  the  world  could  give  him — wealth, honours,  power,  learning.  But,  realising  the danger  of  his  high  position  at  a  Mohammedan Court,  he  divided  his  riches  among  the  poor  and went  as  a  pilgrim  to  Jerusalem,  eventually settling  in  the  famous  Laura  or  monastery  of St.  Sabbas.  His  life  henceforth  is  a  simple record  of  humility,  prayer,  labour  and  obedience. He  passed  away  May  6,  A.D.  780,  being as  is  asserted  one  hundred  and  four  years  old. On  account  of  the  flowing  eloquence  of  his writings  St.  John  acquired  the  surname  "  Chrysorrhoes "  (Golden  Stream).  His  chief  work, that  on  the  Orthodox  Faith,  is  the  first  systematic Treatise  on  Dogmatic  Theology  we  possess, and  has  been  a  model  to  the  writers  of  succeeding ages.  His  convincing  discourses  in defence  of  the  veneration  of  Holy  Pictures marked  him  out  as  a  champion  of  the  Faith against  Leo  the  Isaurian,  the  Iconoclast  Emperor of  Constantinople,  through  whose  machinations he  was  sentenced  to  have  his  right  hand cut  off.  It  was  afterwards  miraculously restored  to  him  by  Our  Blessed  Lady,  whose devout  client  he  ever  was.  Venerated  from his  own  age  as  a  Saint,  Pope  Leo  XIII  numbered him  among  the  Doctors  of  the  Church.  

JOHN  CAPISTRAN  (St.)  (March  28)  
(15th  cent.)  He  was  the  son  of  a  gentleman of  Anjou  (France),  but  was  born  at  Capistrano in  Italy  (a.d.  1385).  He  studied  Civil  and Canon  Law  at  Perugia,  where  he  tried  though  in vain  to  settle  the  disputes  between  the  City of  Perugia  and  Ladislas,  King  of  Naples.  He joined  the  Franciscans  in  Perugia  (a.d.  1415). His  great  humility  and  spirit  of  self-denial  were proof  against  every  trial.  He  became  the  first General  of  the  Observantine  Franciscans  (a.d. 1437).  He  preached  with  wonderful  success in  Italy,  Austria,  Germany  and  Hungary. He  was  the  right  hand  of  the  famous  John Huniades  in  the  defence  of  Vienna,  against the  Turks  (A.D.  1456).  He  had  ever  in  his exhortations  to  the  soldiers  the  Name  of  Jesus on  his  lips.  He  died  at  Vilak  in  Hungary (A.D.  1456).  His  relics  were  thrown  by  the Lutherans  into  the  Danube,  but  happily  were afterwards  recovered.  

JOHN  CLIMACUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  30)  
(7th  cent.)  Born  in  Palestine  about  A.D.  525, while  still  a  youth,  he  made  such  progress  in learning  that  he  acquired  the  surname  of  the "Scholastic."  When  sixteen  years  old,  he turned  from  the  brilliant  future  which  lay before  him  in  the  world  ;  and  retiring  to  Mount Sinai,  put  himself  under  the  direction  of  a  holy monk  who  foretold  that  this  John  would  be  one of  the  brightest  lights  of  the  Eastern  Churches. Nineteen  years  later  he  withdrew  to  yet  deeper 

solitude  and,  by  studying  the  lives  of  the  Saints and  modelling  his  own  on  their  examples, raised  himself  to  a  high  degree  of  contemplative prayer.  His  fame  for  sanctity  drew  to  him crowds  of  disciples,  and  at  the  age  of  seventy-five he  was  chosen  Abbot  of  Mount  Sinai,  where  he wrote  his  famous  book :  "  The  Climax  or Ladder  of  Perfection,"  which  has  been  praised in  all  ages  for  its  wisdom,  its  clearness  and  its unction.  After  four  years  of  Superiorship, he  again  returned  to  his  solitude  and  died A.D.  605.  

♦JOHN  PAYNE  (Bl.)  M.  (April  2)  
(16th  cent.)  A  convert  priest,  a  native  of Northamptonshire,  who,  ordained  at  Douai, returned  to  England  with  Bl.  Cuthbert  Mayne, (A.D.  1576).  He  was  arrested  and  put  to  the torture  in  1581 ;  and  in  the  end  hanged  at Chelmsford,  with  the  Name  of  Jesus  on  his lips.  He  was  greatly  loved  and  venerated  in Essex,  the  scene  of  his  missionary  labours.  

♦JOHN  DE  SURDIS  (Bl.)  Bp.  (April  17)  
(12th  cent.)  A  nobleman  of  Cremona  who became  a  Benedictine  monk  and  afterwards Bishop  of  Vicenza,  in  the  North  of  Italy.  He was  a  model  pastor,  and  in  the  end  met  his death  (A.D.  1181)  at  the  hands  of  certain  evildoers whom  he,  as  in  duty  bound,  had  sought to  correct  and  convert.  

JOHN  of  CONSTANTINOPLE  (St.)  (April  2)  

Abbot.  

(9th  cent.)  An  Abbot  of  the  monastery, called  Cathares  at  Constantinople,  and  a  staunch upholder  of  the  lawfulness  of  the  cultus  paid  by Catholics  to  pictures  or  statues  of  Our  Lord and  His  Saints.  He  flourished  in  the  time  of the  notorious  Leo  the  Isaurian  ;  but  is  believed to  have  survived  to  the  succession  of  the Emperor  Leo  the  Armenian  (a.d.  813).  

♦JOHN  HAILE  (Bl.)  M.  (May  4)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Vicar  of  Isleworth,  near London,  venerated  for  his  holiness  of  life. He  suffered  at  Tyburn  an  unspeakably  horrible but  glorious  martyrdom  in  defence  of  the Primacy  of  the  Apostolic  See  (a.d.  1538).  

JOHN  of  BEVERLEY  (St.)  Bp.  (May  7)  
(8th  cent.)  Born  in  Yorkshire  and  trained at  Canterbury  by  St.  Theodore,  this  Saint became  successively  Bishop  of  Hexham  and Archbishop  of  York.  Among  his  pupils  was his  future  biographer,  Venerable  Bede.  He passed  away  May  7,  A.D.  721.  One  of  his miracles,  the  restoring  speech  and  hearing  to a  man  that  was  deaf  and  dumb,  has  led  to  his being  regarded  as  the  special  Patron  of  those so  afflicted.  His  shrine  at  Beverley,  where he  had  built  a  monastery,  was  a  famous  place of  pilgrimage  in  Mediaeval  England ;  and Oct.  25,  the  anniversary  of  the  Translation of  his  relics,  was  regarded  as  his  chief  festival.  

♦JOHN  of  AVILA  (Bl.)  (May  10)  
(16th  cent.)  Born  at  Toledo  and  early  entering the  Ecclesiastical  state,  this  holy  man devoted  his  whole  life  to  preaching  and  to giving  spiritual  help  to  others.  He  is  looked upon  as  the  father  and  master  of  the  Spanish Saints  and  Mystics  of  his  time.  St.  Teresa, St.  John  of  God,  St.  Francis  Borgia  and  others owed  much  to  his  wise  direction.  He  died Mav  10,  A.D.  1569.  

JOHN  THE  SILENT  (SILENTIARIUS) (May  13) (St.)  Bp.  

(6th  cent.)  Born  at  Nicopolis  In  Armenia (A.D.  454)  and  of  illustrious  descent,  after  the death  of  his  parents,  he  built  a  church  and monastery  in  his  native  city  and,  with  some fervent  companions,  gave  himself  utterly  up  to a  life  of  prayer  and  penance.  After  ten  years he  was  made  Bishop  of  Colonia  in  Armenia, where  for  nine  years  he  showed  himself  a shining  example  to  his  people.  He  then resigned  his  Bishopric,  and  quietly  sought  the Laura  or  monastery  of  St.  Sabbas,  near  Jerusalem. He  succeeded  in  concealing  the  fact that  he  was  a  Bishop  ;  and  St.  Sabbas  employed 
1*9 

JOHN 
him  as  a  labourer,  promoting  him  later  to  the offices  of  guest-master  and  house  steward. When  some  time  later  still,  St.  Sabbas  proposed that  the  monk  John  should  be  ordained  priest, the  Saint  was  compelled  to  confide  to  the Patriarch  of  Jerusalem  that  he  was  already  a Bishop.  This  St.  John  the  Silent  is  one  of  the Fathers  of  the  Desert  to  whom  ancient  writers attribute  a  longevity  far  surpassing  that  of average  man.  We  are  told  that  St.  John  the Silent  survived  until  a.d.  558,  when  he  would have  attained  the  age  of  one  hundred  and  four.  

JOHN  BAPTIST  DE  LA  SALLE  (St.)  (May  15) (18th  cent.)  A  French  priest,  Founder  of the  Society  of  the  Christian  Brothers,  and  raised up  by  Almighty  God  to  be  an  Apostle  of  the Christian  Education  of  Youth.  Born  (a.d.  1651) at  Reims,  of  noble  parents,  and  having  taken Holy  Orders  at  the  completion  of  his  studies, he  felt  inspired  by  God  to  renounce  the  canonry to  which  he  had  been  appointed,  and  to  sell all  that  he  possessed  for  the  benefit  of  the  poor. He  to  the  end  of  his  days  led  a  life  of  austere penance,  sacrificing  himself  utterly  to  the service  of  his  neighbour.  With  patience  he overcame  the  many  obstacles  which  stood  in the  way  of  the  establishment  of  his  Institute, which  was  formally  approved  by  the  Holy  See a  few  years  after  his  holy  death  (a.d.  1719).  

JOHN  NEPOMUCEN  (St.)  M.  (May  16)  
(14th  cent.)  The  Martyr  of  the  Secret  of Confession.  Born  (a.d.  1330  about)  at  Nepomuck  in  Bohemia,  he  became  Canon  of  Prague and  eventually  Court  Chaplain  and  Confessor to  the  Empress  Jane,  wife  of  the  dissolute Wenceslaus  IV.  For  refusing  to  reveal  what he  had  heard  from  her  in  Sacramental  Confession, St.  John  was  by  order  of  Wenceslaus, thrown  into  the  River  Moldau  and  drowned (a.d.  1383).  In  life,  his  dwelling-place  had been  the  resort  of  all  who  were  in  distress,  and in  his  humility  he  had  refused  bishoprics  and other  preferments  offered  to  him.  He  was canonised  a.d.  1729.  Ten  years  previously his  tomb  had  been  opened.  His  flesh  had returned  to  its  dust ;  only  his  tongue  was fresh  and  incorrupt.  

♦JOHN  FORREST  (Bl.)  M.  (May  22)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Franciscan  Friar  of  Greenwich, Confessor  to  Queen  Catharine  of  Aragon. After  a  long  imprisonment,  which  it  would seem  he  owed  at  least  in  part  to  the  instigation of  the  Apostate  Latimer,  he  was  condemned to  be  burned  at  the  stake  in  Smithfield.  By a  refinement  of  cruelty  he  was  suspended  over the  flames,  which  at  the  outset  only  reached his  feet.  He  won  his  everlasting  crown  May 22,  A.D.  1538.  

JOHN  BAPTIST  DEI  ROSSI  (St.)  (May  23)  
(18th  cent.)  An  Italian  Saint,  born  near Genoa,  who,  educated  in  Rome  and  ordained priest,  became  a  model  of  holy  living  to  the secular  clergy  of  the  Eternal  City.  He  was appointed  Canon  in  one  of  the  Roman  churches, and  devoted  all  his  time  and  powers  to  his priestly  work  among  the  people,  living  himself a  life  of  prayer  and  penance.  He  was  especially admirable  for  his  whole-hearted  sacrifice  of  self in  the  helping  of  the  poor.  He  died  a.d.  1764, at  the  age  of  sixty,  and  was  canonised  by Pope  Leo  XIII  a.d.  1881.  

♦JOHN  STONE  (Bl.)  M.  (May  23)  
(16th  cent.)  The  English  Menology  commemorates this  Holy  Martyr  on  May  23,  though neither  the  day  nor  the  year  of  his  death  have so  far  been  ascertained.  He  was  an  Augustinian Friar,  and  is  believed  to  have  won  his  Crown  at the  outset  of  the  persecution,  about  A.D.  1538. He  has  always  been  venerated  as  one  of  the victims  of  the  Anti-Catholic  policy  of  Henry VIII.  His  place  of  martyrdom  was  Canterbury.  

JOHN  OF  PRADO  (St.)  M.  (May  24)  
(17th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Franciscan  Friar who  crossed  over  to  Morocco  in  order  to  preach 150 

Christianity  to  the  Moors,  and  by  them  was cast  into  a  dungeon,  loaded  with  chains,  put  to the  torture,  scourged  and  finally  burned  alive for  the  Faith  of  Jesus  Christ,  May  24,  a.d. 1636.  

JOHN  I  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (May  27)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Tuscan  who  from  being  Archdeacon of  Rome  became  Pope,  in  succession  to St.  Hormisdas  (A.D.  523).  His  short  reign  was troubled  by  the  machinations  of  Theodoric, the  Arian  King  of  the  Ostro-Goths,  at  that time  masters  of  Italy.  St.  John,  at  the  instance of  Theodoric,  repaired  to  Constantinople  to treat  with  the  Catholic  Emperor,  Justin  I ; but  on  his  return  to  Italy  was  thrown  into prison  at  Ravenna  by  Theodoric,  and  soon  died therein  of  want  and  hardships  (18  May,  A.D. 526).  His  body,  brought  at  once  to  Rome,  was interred  in  St.  Peter's  (May  27).  Many  miracles are  related  of  him,  especially  his  having  at Constantinople  given  sight  to  a  man  born blind.  

♦JOHN  SHERT  (Bl.)  M.  (May  28)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Bachelor  of  Arts  of  Oxford and  a  schoolmaster,  who  having  been  ordained priest  in  Rome,  worked  for  some  years  on  the English  Mission.  He  received  the  Crown  of Martyrdom  at  Tyburn  (a.d.  1582)  together with  Bl.  Thomas  Forde.  On  seeing  the  Sacred Body  of  his  Fellow-Martyr,  hanging  on  the gallows,  he  cried  out :  "  Happy  art  Thou, Blessed  Soul.  Pray  for  me." 
♦JOHN  STOREY  (Bl.)  M.  (June  1)  
(16th  cent.)  The  Principal  of  an  Oxford College  and  Vicar-General  to  the  Bishop  of London.  On  the  accession  of  Elizabeth,  he took  refuge  on  the  Continent  and  filled  various important  offices  under  the  Spanish  Crown. But  burning  with  a  thirst  for  martyrdom,  he contrived  to  return  to  England,  and  was  forthwith arrested  and  executed  at  Tyburn  (a.d. 1553),  dying  for  the  Dogma  of  the  Papal Primacy.  

JOHN  of  VERONA  (St.)  Bp.  (June  6)  
(4th cent.)  A Bishop of Verona (North 
Italy)  in  the  fourth  century,  the  successor  of 
St. Maurus.  No particulars of  his  life have 
come  down  to  us.  

JOHN  of  ST.  FACUNDUS  (St.)  (June  12)  
(15th  cent.)  Born  at  Sahagun  (S.  Fagoudrz) in  Spain,  from  an ,  early  age  he  had  held several  Benefices  in '  the  Diocese  of  Burgos  ; but  the  reproaches  of  his  conscience  forced  him to  resign  them  all,  except  one  chapel  where  he daily  said  Mass,  preached  and  catechised. He  studied  Theology  at  Salamanca,  and  ultimately became  a  Hermit  of  the  Augustinian Order  in  the  same  city.  His  life  was  marked by  a  singular  devotion  to  Holy  Mass.  Each night  after  Matins,  he  remained  in  choir  till  the hour  of  celebration.  The  power  of  his  personal holiness,  felt  in  his  preaching,  produced  a complete  reformation  in  Salamanca.  He  had a  special  gift  of  reconciling  enemies.  He sedulously  denounced  the  vice  of  impurity rife  at  the  time  ;  and  died  in  defence  of  the Angelic  virtue,  being  poisoned  by  a  woman whose  companion  in  sin  he  had  converted. He  went  to  his  reward,  A.D.  1479.  

JOHN  FRANCIS  REGIS  (St.)  (June  16)  
(17th  cent.)  A  Jesuit  Saint,  a  man  of  truly Apostolic  life,  whose  heart  was  ever  on  fire  with the  Love  of  God  and  of  his  neighbour.  Born A.D.  1597  in  Languedoc  (France),  he  entered the  Society  of  Jesus  at  the  age  of  eighteen, and  was  ordained  priest  fifteen  years  later. From  then  to  his  holy  death  (Dec.  31,  A.D. 1640),  he  may  be  said  to  have  spent  every  day of  his  life  in  preaching,  catechising  and  hearing confessions.  His  field  of  work  was  Central  and Southern  France.  Countless  were  the  conversions of  sinners  with  which  Almighty  God blessed  his  zeal.  In  life  and  in  death  he  worked miracles,  and  was  canonised  by  Pope  Clement XII  (A.D.  1737). 
JOHN 

♦JOHN  FISHER  (Bl.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  22)  
(16th  cent.)  One  of  the  first  and  perhaps the  most  illustrious  of  the  English  Martyrs  of the  sixteenth  century.  Born  in  Yorkshire  and educated  at  Cambridge,  he  was  consecrated Bishop  of  Rochester  a.d.  1504.  Thirty  years later  he  bravely  upheld  the  cause  of  Queen Catharine  of  Aragon  against  her  adulterous husband  ;  and  on  the  unlawful  oath  of  Royal Supremacy  being  tendered  to  him  steadfastly refused  to  defile  his  conscience  by  taking  it. For  this  he  was  beheaded  in  the  Tower  of London,  a.d.  1535,  his  age,  infirmities,  merits and  the  popular  veneration  in  which  he  was held  notwithstanding.  He  died  with  the  words of  the  Te  Deum  on  his  lips,  and  was  buried  in the  Tower.  

JOHN  of  NAPLES  (St.)  Bp.  (June  22)  
(5th  and  9th  cent.)  Both  John  I  and  John IV,  Bishops  of  Naples,  are  honoured  as  Saints. To  the  former,  early  in  the  fifth  century,  who translated  the  body  of  St.  Januarius  from Puteoli  to  Naples,  should  be  attributed  the  vision of  St.  Paulinus,  mentioned  on  this  day  in  the Roman  Martyrology.  St.  John  IV,  successor of  Bishop  Tiberius  in  the  ninth  century,  was  a learned  and  zealous  prelate,  the  peacemaker  of his  time.  He  died  a.d.  853,  in  such  repute  of sanctity  that  he  is  honoured  as  one  of  the principal  Patrons  of  the  City  of  Naples. :  Locally,  he  is  known  as  San  Giovanni  d'Acquarolla.  

JOHN  (St.)  M.  (June  23)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  priest  who  was  dragged 
before  an  idol  in  the  reign  of  Julian  the  Apostate 
and,  on  his  refusal  to  burn  incense  before  it, 
was  beheaded  a.d.  362.  

JOHN  THE  BAPTIST  (St.)  (June  24)  

Fore-runner  of  Our  Lord. (1st  cent.)  What  we  know  of  St.  John  the Baptist  "  than  whom  among  them  that  are born  of  women  a  greater  hath  not  arisen" (Matt.  xi.  11),  from  his  sanctification  in  his mother's  womb  (Luke  i.)  to  his  martyrdom under  King  Herod  (Mark  vi.),  is  set  down  in Holy  Scripture.  The  historian  Josephus  attributes Herod's  subsequent  misfortunes  and miserable  death  to  his  murder  of  St.  John. The  latter  has  always  had  a  chief  place  in  the veneration  given  by  Holy  Church  to  the  Servants of  God.  His  relics  appear  to  have  been  dispersed in  the  fourth  century  at  the  time  of Julian  the  Apostate.  Some  were  honoured at  Alexandria.  His  head  or  part  of  it  is  venerated in  the  church  of  St.  Sylvester  in  Rome. France  claims  another  portion  brought  to Amiens  in  the  time  of  the  Crusades.  

JOHN  THEREST  (St.)  (June  24)  
(12th  cent.)  Of  Calabrian  parentage,  he  was born  in  Sicily,  whither  his  mother  had  been carried  by  the  Mohammedans  who  in  the twelfth  century  made  frequent  inroads  into Italy.  He  escaped  from  the  Infidels  while  still a  child  and,  crossing  into  Italy,  was  baptised and  permitted  to  embrace  the  life  of  a  hermit under  the  discipline  of  two  Basilian  monks  in repute  of  high  sanctity.  In  this  he  persevered to  the  day  of  his  death  (Feb.  24,  A.D.  1129), excelling  in  sanctity  even  his  masters.  Ho worked  many  miracles  to  the  edification  and help  of  those  who  sought  his  prayers.  

JOHN  and  PAUL  (SS.)  MM.  (June  26)  
(4th  cent.)  Two  famous  Christian  heroes, reputed  the  last  to  have  suffered  in  Rome  for refusing  to  worship  idols  (a.d.  362),  under Julian  the  Apostate.  They  are  daily  commemorated in  the  Canon  of  the  Mass  ;  and  their shrine  on  the  Mons  Ccelius  is  one  of  the  most frequented  in  Rome.  Much  controversy  has arisen  in  modern  times  concerning  their  identity. The  traditional  account  is  that  they  were brothers,  officials  in  the  household  of  Constantia,  daughter  of  the  Emperor  Constantine  ; that  they  were  secretly  put  to  death  in  their own  house,  by  order  of  Julian  ; and  that  their 

glorious  end  became  public  through  the  many wonders  wrought  at  their  tomb.  These  also (it  is  alleged)  led  to  the  conversion  of  Terentianus,  the  judge  who  had  passed  sentence  of death  upon  them.  

JOHN  of  TOURS  (St.)  (June  27)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  hermit  who  in  the  sixth century  had  his  cell  in  the  neighbourhood  of Tours.  He  was  the  spiritual  guide  of  the saintly  Queen  Radegundis,  and  remarkable for  the  gift  he  had  received  of  high  prayer.  

JOHN  of  BERGAMO  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (July  11)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Bergamo  in  Lombardy  who  during  his  twenty-four  years  of Episcopate  succeeded  in  extirpating  the  last traces  of  Arianism  from  his  Diocese,  but  in  the end  paid  for  his  zeal  with  his  life.  He  was  done to  death  a.d.  681  by  the  partisans  of  the heretics.  He  took  part  (as  appears  from  its Acts)  in  the  Council  held  in  Rome  by  Pope St.  Agatho  (A.D.  680).  

JOHN  GUALBERT  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  12)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Florentine  nobleman  who spent  his  youth  in  idle  dissipation,  but  was brought  by  a  Providential  inspiration  to  turn to  the  pursuit  of  worthier  objects.  Hugo,  his brother,  had  been  murdered,  and  John,  as was  the  custom  of  the  nobles  of  his  century, deemed  it  his  duty  to  avenge  his  death.  However, he  only  met  the  murderer  on  a  Good Friday,  after  he  had  listened  to  a  sermon in  which  the  example  of  Christ  on  the  Cross, pardoning  His  enemies  was  dwelt  upon.  Moved by  the  thoughts  thus  suggested,  the  young noble  overcame  himself  and  freely  pardoned, so  far  as  he  was  concerned,  the  wrongdoer. Then,  entering  a  church  and  kneeling  before  a Crucifix,  he  sought  pardon  for  his  own  sins. Raising  his  eyes  he  saw  the  Crucified  Saviour miraculously  bow  His  Head  as  if  according the  pardon  he  asked  for.  He  thereupon  applied to  be  received  as  a  monk  in  the  neighbouring monastery ;  but  soon  in  the  desire  for  greater solitude  betook  himself  to  the  forest  country of  Vallis  Umbrosa  (Vallombrosa),  where  he founded  a  house  of  strict  Benedictine  Observance. The  new  Institute  was  approved  by  the then  Pope  in  a.d.  1070,  and  governed  by  St. John  until  his  death,  three  years  later,  when he  found  himself  already  at  the  head  of  twelve monasteries.  He  was  canonised  by  Pope Celestine  III.

(14th  cent.)  A  member  of  an  ancient  family of  Siena  in  Tuscany.  He  had  honourably discharged  the  duties  of  First  Magistrate,  and was  wedded  to  worldly  pursuits,  when  the reading  of  the  Life  of  the  famous  penitent, St.  Mary  of  Egypt,  made  of  him  a  changed  man. Selling  all  his  goods,  he  gave  the  proceeds  to the  poor  and,  with  the  consent  of  his  wife, made  a  vow  of  chastity.  Thenceforth,  he  set about  practising  rigorous  penance,  and  employed himself  serving  the  sick  in  the  hospitals. He  was  soon  joined  by  others,  who  from  their often  pronouncing  the  Sacred  Name  of  Jesus, came  to  be  known  as  "  Jesuates."  His  Institute was  approved  (a.d.  1367)  by  Pope  Urban V,  and  St.  John  died  thirty  days  after  the  seal thus  put  upon  his  work.  It  lasted  three hundred  years,  being  suppressed  on  account of  its  paucity  of  members,  A.D.  1668.  

♦JOHN  FELTON  (Bl.)  M.  (Aug.  8)

(17th  cent.)  Born  in  Brabant,  he  was received  while  quite  young  into  the  Society  of Jesus,  and  sent  to  Rome  for  his  studies.  He died  at  the  age  of  twenty-two  ;  but  his  ardour in  the  practice  of  virtue  and  assiduity  in  prayer were  such  that  he  had  visibly  attained  already to  a  great  height  of  sanctity  before  he  passed away  (Aug.  13,  A.D.  1621).  He  was  canonised by  Pope  Leo  XIII.  

JOHN  and  CRISPUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  18)  
(4th  cent.)  Two  Roman  priests  who,  during the  persecution  under  Diocletian,  devoted themselves  to  the  recovering  and  interring  the bodies  of  the  Christian  Martyrs.  The  fate  of these  they  ultimately  shared  in  one  of  the  first years  of  the  fourth  century.

(17th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  founder  of  the well-known  Religious  Congregation  called  after him  the  Eudists.  Their  work  is  chiefly  the direction  of  Ecclesiastical  Seminaries  and  the preparing  of  youth  for  the  priesthood.

(14th  cent.)  A  Flemish  Saint  who,  after many  years  of  usefulness  as  a  secular  priest, retired  to  the  then  solitary  hermitage  of  Grcenendaal  in  the  forest  of  Soignies,  and  eventually founded  there  a  monastery  of  Canons  Regular, over  which  he  presided  as  Prior.  He  was favoured  with  many  supernatural  gifts,  and occupies  a  prominent  place  among  Mediaeval Mystics.  His  ascetic  writings  have  a  special charm.  He  passed  away  Dec.  2,  A.D.  1381,  in the  eighty-eighth  year  of  his  age.  The  Roman Decree  authorising  his  cultus  was  issued  A.D.  1908.

His  great  work was  to  combat  the  vice  then  rampant  in  Italian social  life.  He  was  remarkable  too  for  his solicitude  in  regard  to  the  poor  and  for  his insistence  on  Church  discipline.  His  people, who  idolised  him,  straightway  after  his  death canonised  him  as  a  Saint.

(19th  cent.)  The  famous  "  Cure  d'Ars." Born  a.d.  1786,  he,  after  the  troubles  of  the French  Revolution  and  the  Napoleonic  wars, was  ordained  priest.  He  toiled  all  his  life  as Pastor  of  the  obscure  village  of  Ars  in  Central France,  converting  sinners  and  guiding  numberless souls  to  God.  The  fame  of  his  sanctity drew  multitudes  from  all  parts  to  seek  help  and spiritual  comfort  from  him  in  his  poor  Presbyterv.  He  died  Aug.  4,  A.D.  1859,  and  was beatified  by  Pope  Pius  X  (A.D.  1905).

(17th  cent.)  An  Italian  Saint  of  Luni  in Tuscany,  founder  of  the  Institute  of  the  "  Clerks Regular  of  the  Mother  of  God,"asociety  devoted especially  to  Apostolic  work  in  Italy.

He is  looked  upon  as  one  of  the  founders  of  the great  Roman  College  of  the  Propaganda  for Foreign  Missions.  He  fell  asleep  in  Christ  in Rome,  Oct.  9,  A.D.  1609,  at  the  age  of  sixty, and  was  canonised  in  the  twentieth  century.  

JOHN  CANTIUS  (St.)  (Oct.  20)  
(15th  cent.)  A  native  of  Poland,  drawn  to piety  from  his  earliest  years.  Having  taken his  degrees  in  the  University  of  Cracow,  he  was appointed  there  to  the  Chair  of  Theology. For  some  time  he  took  charge  of  a  parish,  but, fearing  the  responsibility  of  the  care  of  souls, returned  to  his  University  and  taught  there  till his  holy  death  at  the  age  of  seventy-six  (Dec.  24, A.D.  1473).  He  was  a  Saint  of  most  austere and  prayerful  life,  and  literally  again  and  again distributed  to  the  poor  all  that  he  possessed. He  was  canonised  by  Pope  Clement  XIII  in the  eighteenth  century,  and  his  Feast  was ordered  to  be  kept  annually  in  the  Universal Church  on  Oct.  20.

(17th  cent.)  Born  near  Avila  in  Spain (A.D.  1542),  he  entered  the  Carmelite  Order at  the  age  of  twenty-one,  and  was  ordained priest  in  A.D.  1567.  After  practising  extraordinary austerities,  he  was  led  under  the influence  of  St.  Teresa  to  found  the  Institute of  Bare-Footed  Carmelites,  approved  (A.D.  1580) by  Pope  Gregory  XIII,  and  flourishing  to  our own  day.  He  not  only  passed  through  many spiritual  and  interior  trials,  but  underwent much  persecution  and  even  imprisonment. He  died  A.D.  1605,  and  was  canonised  by  Pope Benedict  XIII  (A.D.  1726).  His  wonderful works  on  Mystical  Theology,  "  The  Ascent  of Mount  Carmel,"  "The  Dark  Night,"  "The Spiritual  Canticle,"  "  The  Living  Flame,"  make him  the  master  and  guide  of  all  who  are  favoured with  the  gift  of  supernatural  prayer.

JOHN  THAUMATURGUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  5)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Polybotum  in  Phrygia  (Asia  Minor),  one  of  the  most  strenuous champions  of  Orthodoxy  against  the  Emperor Leo  the  Image-Breaker  (a.d.  716-741).  So great  was  St.  John's  reputation  for  holiness  and the  fame  of  the  miracles  he  wrought,  whence his  surname  "Thaumaturgus  "  (Wonder-worker), that  the  Emperor  did  not  dare  to  interfere  with him  in  his  zealous  pastoral  charge  of  his  flock. His  people  were  devoted  to  him,  and  he  passed away  in  peace  among  them.  

♦JOHN  MARINONI  (Bl.)  (Dec.  13)

He  became  the  "  beloved  disciple," and  was  the  only  one  of  the  Twelve  who  did  not forsake  the  Saviour  in  the  hour  of  His  Passion. He  stood  faithfully  at  the  foot  of  the  Cross, whence  the  dying  Lord  made  him  the  guardian of  his  Immaculate  Mother.  His  later  life  seems to  have  been  passed  chiefly  in  Jerusalem,  but latterly  at  Ephesus,  whence  he  founded  many Churches  in  Asia  Minor.  He  wrote  a  Gospel, supplementary  to  the  three  others,  three  Epistles and  the  wonderful  and  mysterious  Book  of the  Apocalypse  or  Revelation.  Brought  to Rome,  a  tradition  adopted  by  the  Church relates  that  he  was  cast  by  order  of  the  Emperor Domitian  into  a  caldron  of  boiling  oil ;  but, like  the  Three  Children  in  the  fiery  furnace  of Babylon,  miraculously  preserved  unhurt.  He was  banished  to  the  Island  of  Patmos,  where  he wrote  the  Apocalypse,  but  afterwards  returned to  Ephesus,  where  he  lived  to  an  extreme  old age,  surviving  all  his  fellowApostles.

He  was  employed as  gardener  to  his  brethren,  and  persevered  in his  humble  toil  for  eighty-five  years,  working while  it  was  light,  and  in  the  night  time  plaiting ropes  and  repeating  over  Psalms  and  Canticles from  the  Holy  Scriptures.  His  austerities  were marvellous ; and  it  is  recorded  of  him  that, 

as  penance  for  his  fault  in  not  cutting  down  a fig-tree  when  directed  to  do  so,  he  abstained from  eating  fruit  to  the  day  of  his  death. JONAS,  BARACHISIUS  and  OTHERS (March  29)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  King  Sapor  II  of  Persia,  in  the eighteenth  year  of  his  reign,  raised  a  fierce  persecution against  the  Christians.  Among  the  sufferers were  the  two  brothers,  Jonas  and  Barachisius  of  the  city  of  BethAsa.  While  travelling about  and  encouraging  the  Christians  of  his neighbourhood  (nine  of  whom  received  the Crown  of  Martyrdom),  they  were  arrested  and after  bravely  enduring  every  form  of  torture, laid  down  their  lives  for  Christ's  sake.  They died  A.D.  327. JONAS  (St.)  Prophet.  (Sept.  21)  
(8th  cent.  B.C.)  One  of  the  Twelve  Lesser Prophets  and  the  inspired  writer  of  a  Canonical Book  of  Holy  Scripture.  To  what  Almighty God  has  therein  revealed  concerning  him  tradition adds  that,  having  returned  from  Nineveh into  Palestine,  he  retired  with  his  mother  to  near the  city  of  Sur,  where  he  died  B.C.  761.  In  the time  of  St.  Jerome  his  tomb  was  shown  at  Diospolis.  Most  of  the  Oriental  Chinches  include him  in  their  Kalendars. JONAS  (YON)  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  22)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  companion  or  disciple of  St.  Denis  of  Paris.  He  evangelised  either the  city  of  Chartres  or  laboured  at  some  place of  similar  name  (Chdtres,  now  Arpajon)  in  the neighbourhood  of  Paris,  and  eventually  won  the Crown  of  Martyrdom.  His  relics  were  venerated at  Corbeil  and  in  other  places.  The  Acts  we have  of  this  Saint  are  altogether  untrustworthy. His  date  depends  on  that  of  St.  Denis,  so  much controverted,  either  in  the  first  or  in  the  third century. JOSAPHAT  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  12)  
(17th  cent.)  The  first  of  the  Orientals  to  be formally  canonised  in  Rome.  Born  at  Vladimir in  Poland  (A.D.  1584)  at  the  age  of  twenty he  entered  the  Order  of  St.  Basil.  Night  and day  he  prayed  for  the  extinction  of  the  Eastern Schism  and  for  the  Union  of  the  Greeks  with Rome,  performing  the  most  rigorous  penances with  the  view  of  obtaining  this  from  Almighty God.  Many  were  the  conversions  brought about  by  his  indefatigable  zeal.  He  was ordained  priest,  and  afterwards,  when  in  his thirty-ninth  year,  consecrated  Archbishop  of Polotsk  in  Lithuania.  Thenceforward  in  a position  to  put  new  life  into  his  clergy  and  people, he  profited  them  not  only  by  word  but even  more  by  his  example.  Though  warned not  to  visit  the  parish  of  Witepsk,  overrun  by the  Schismatics,  as  a  brave  shepherd  of  souls he  faced  the  danger,  and  was  cruelly  put  to death  there  by  the  enemies  of  the  Faith  (Nov. 12,  A.D.  1623).  He  was  canonised  by  Pope Pius  IX  (A.D.  1867). JOSAPHAT  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  27)

He  succeeded brilliantly  in  his  studies,  and  when  ordained priest  was  presented  with  a  canonry  in  the Cathedral  of  Turin.  But  his  lifework  was  the service  of  the  poor  and  distressed.

nineteenth  century).  Not  one  Institute  only, but  very  many  (answering  to  differences  of age,  sex,  health,  bodily  and  mental  fitness) were  begun  by  him  and  successfully  organised into  one  connected  whole.  His  establishment, which  he  called  "  The  Little  House,"  now provides  for  about  ten  thousand  souls,  otherwise spiritually  or  temporally  destitute.  The  holy man's  own  life  was  austere  and  one  of  high prayer.  Many  were  the  supernatural  favours he  received  from  Almighty  God.  He  went to  his  reward  April  30,  a.d.  1842,  and  was beatified  by  Pope  Benedict  XV  (a.d.  1917).

During  his  stay  among  the  Infidels  he  suffered both  imprisonment  and  torture.  He  returned to  Italy  to  die  of  a  long  and  painful  malady (A.D.  1612).  Pope  Benedict  XIV  canonised him  in  the  following  century.  

JOSEPH  (JOSIPPUS)  of  ANTIOCH  (Feb.  15)  
(St.)  M.  

(Date  unknown.)  A  deacon  who,  with  seven others,  is  set  down  as  having  suffered  martyrdom at  Antioch  in  one  of  the  early  persecutions. But  no  date  and  no  particulars  are  given  by any  reliable  authority.  

JOSEPH  of  ANTIOCH  (St.)  (Feb.  15)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Syrian  deacon  of  Antioch  and writer  of  Hymns.  He  distinguished  himself  by his  zeal  for  orthodoxy  against  the  Iconoclasts of  the  time  of  the  Emperor  Theophilus  (a.d. 829-840).  

JOSEPH  of  ARIMATHiEA  (St.)  (March  17)  
(1st  cent.)  Holy  Scripture  tells  us  of  the  part this  holy  man,  "  a  noble  councillor  "  (Mark  xv. 43)  took  in  the  Burial  of  the  Body  of  Our Blessed  Lord.  Various  traditions  present  him to  us  as  having  lived  to  be  over  eighty  years of  age,  and  as  having  preached  the  Gospel  in various  countries.  That  which  makes  of  him the  First  Apostle  of  the  Britons  and  Founder of  Glastonbury  has  little  evidence  to  support it,  though  the  choice  of  him  for  Patron  Saint of  the  church  existing  there  from  time  immemorial still  awaits  explanation.  

JOSEPH  (St.)  (March  19)  
(1st  cent.)  Of  St.  Joseph,  Spouse  of  the Virgin  Mother  of  God  and  Foster-Father  of Our  Blessed  Lord,  Almighty  God  has  revealed that  he  was  "  a  just  man  "  (Matt.  i.  19).  Beyond what  we  learn  of  him  from  Holy  Scripture, the  facts  of  his  life  are  unknown  to  us.  From the  circumstance  of  his  not  being  mentioned in  the  history  of  the  Passion,  it  is  believed  that already  then  he  had  gone  to  his  rest.  Devotion to  him  as  a  Saint,  fervent  in  the  East  from earl*  ages,  has  later  grown  in  the  West  in  such marvellous  wise  that  he  is  now  formally  constituted the  Patron  Saint  of  the  Universal Church,  and  that  the  nations  of  Christendom vie  with  one  another  in  doing  him  honour. The  churches  and  altars  dedicated  to  him  in all  parts  of  the  world  are  literally  numberless.

See  SS.  PHOTINA,  JOSEPH, &c.  

JOSEPH  ORIOL  (St.)  (March  23)  
(18th  cent.)  A  Spanish  priest,  the  son  of poor  parents  at  Barcelona,  where  he  died  (a.d. 1702)  at  the  age  of  fifty-two.  He  gave  his whole  life  to  the  practice  of  austerities  and  to the  conve  ng  of  sinners.  Beloved  by  all  at Barcelona,  >  life  and  after  death,  lie  was  in popular  ven  ation  as  a  Saint,  and  the  many supernatural  gifts  bestowed  upon  him  by Almighty  Goa  witnessed  to  the  truth  of  the popular  belief. 154 

JOSEPH  of  PERSIA  (St.)  M.  (April  22)  

See  PERSIA  (MARTYRS  of).  

JOSEPH  BARSABAS  (St.)  (July  20)  
(1st  cent.)  Surnamed  "  The  Just  "  (Acts  i. 23),  and  one  of  the  seventy-two  disciples  sent out  by  Our  Lord  (Luke  x.  1).  St.  Matthias was  preferred  to  him  for  the  Apostleship  ;  but he,  nevertheless,  tradition  tells  us,  devoted  his life  to  the  work  of  evangelising  the  heathen. He  preached  through  many  lands,  suffering much  from  the  enmity  of  the  Jews,  his  fellowcountrymen,  who  are  said  to  have  on  one occasion  made  him  drink  poison,  from  the  fatal consequences  of  which  he  was  miraculously saved  (Mark  xvi.  18).  

JOSEPH  of  PALESTINE  (St.)  (July  22)  
(4th  cent.)  As  we  learn  from  his  Life, written  by  St.  Epiphanius,  he  was  by  birth  a Jew ;  but  after  prolonged  resistance  to  the call  of  Almighty  God  was  converted  to  Christianity, and  on  that  account  afterwards  cruelly persecuted  by  his  former  co-religionists.  Favoured by  the  Emperor  Constantine,  he  received from  him  the  title  and  authority  of  a  Count (Comes),  and  set  upon  building  churches  in the  Holy  Land  and  otherwise  spreading  the knowledge  of  the  Christian  Faith.  He  was  the host  in  Palestine  of  St.  Eusebius  of  Vercelli, driven  into  exile  by  the  Arians.  He  is  said to  have  survived  till  a.d.  356,  when  he  passed away  at  Scythopolis  (Galilee).  

JOSEPH  CALASANCTIUS  (St.)  (Aug.  27)  
(17th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Saint,  a  talented scholar  and  the  Apostle  of  Christian  Education. From  his  very  childhood  it  was  a  passion  with him  to  help  on  his  companions  in  their  Catechism and  other  lessons.  Ordained  priest,  he  was busied  with  pastoral  work,  until  in  a  vision  he learned  that  he  was  to  go  to  Rome  and  there find  the  task  God  imposed  upon  him.  This was  to  found  the  Order  of  Clerks  of  the  Mother of  God  of  the  Christian  Schools  (Scuole  Pie, whence  the  name  Scolopii).  For  twenty  years he  devoted  himself  to  this  work,  which  has lasted  to  our  own  days.  Many  and  great  were his  sufferings  from  ill-health  and  from  the persecution  of  ill-wishers.  His  life  of  sacrifice was  crowned  by  a  holy  death  (a.d.  1648),  he being  then  ninety-two  years  old.  

JOSEPH  of  CUPERTINO  (St.)  (Sept.  18)  
(17th  cent.)  Joseph  Desa  was  born  at Copertino  near  Brindisi  (a.d.  1602).  With some  difficulty  he  obtained  admission  as  a Lay-Brother  among  the  Conventual  Franciscans ;  but  on  account  of  his  rare  spiritual  gifts was  soon  promoted  to  the  priesthood.  Very wonderful  were  the  penances  he  inflicted  upon himself ;  more  marvellous  still  the  gift  of ecstatic  prayer  with  which  Almighty  God  endued him.  "  O  Lord,  be  Thou  my  only  good,"  was the  aspiration  ever  on  his  lips.  To  be  misunderstood and  to  be  calumniated  was  a  lot he  shared  with  many  of  God's  servants.  He wrought  many  miracles,  both  in  his  life  and  after his  holy  death,  which  occurred  at  Osimo,  near Ancona  (a.d.  1672).  He  was  canonised  in  the following  century  by  Pope  Clement  XIII.  

JOSSE  (JOST,  JODER)  (St.)  (Dec.  13)  

Otherwise  St.  JUDOCUS,  which  see.  

JOSUE  (JOSHUA)  (St.)  Patriarch.  (Sept.  1 )  
(15th  cent.  B.C.)  The  leader  of  the  Israelites into  the  Land  of  Chanaan.  Beyond  what  we learn  of  him  from  the  Pentateuch  and  from  the Canonical  Book  entitled  after  him,  we  have  no record  of  his  life,  nor  any  reliable  traditions associated  with  him.  He  has  been  venerated as  a  Saint  in  the  Christian  Church  from  the earliest  times.  

JOVIAN  (JOVINIAN)  (St.)  M.  (May  5)  
(4th  cent.)  A  fellow-missionary  with  St. Peregrinus  of  Auxerre,  sent  into  Gaul  by  Pope St.  Xystus  II  in  the  middle  of  the  third  century, where,  by  his  learning  and  knowledge  of  Holy Scripture,  he  rendered  great  service  to  his holy  Bishop  in  the  Office  of  Lector  or  Reader. 
JULIAN 

He  is  believed  to  have  survived  until  after A.d.  300,  when,  like  St.  Peregrinus,  he  gave  his life  for  the  Faith. JOVINUS  and  BASILEUS  (SS.)  MM. (March  2)  
(3rd  cent.)  Two  Saints  who  suffered  martyrdom in  Rome  under  the  Emperors  Gallienus  and Valerian,  about  a.d.  258.  They  were  interred on  the  Latin  Way  (Via  Latino),  later  a  great place  of  pilgrimage  on  account  of  its  being  the burial-place  of  these  and  of  many  other  Christian heroes.

(Date unknown.)  An African Martyr of 
uncertain  date  registered  by  all  the  old  Martyro
logies  as  having  perished  by  being  cast  into  the 
sea.

(5th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Terentianus, and  tenth  (or  perhap3  fourteenth)  Bishop  of Bologna,  in  Italy.  Beyond  the  fact  that  he restored  one  of  the  churches  of  his  city,  nothing is  now  known  of  his  life.  He  flourished  about a.d.  485,  though  some  post-date  his  Episcopate to  the  following  century. JUDE  (THADD^EUS)  (St.)  Apostle.  (Oct.  28)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  Twelve,  the  brother of  St.  James  the  Less,  and  therefore  related  by blood  to  Our  Blessed  Lord.  He  is  the  inspired writer  of  one  of  the  Canonical  Epistles.  The tradition  is  that  he  preached  the  Gospel,  first in  Mesopotamia,  and  afterwards,  in  company with  his  fellowApostle  St.  Simon,  in  Persia. They  are  said  to  have  gathered  in  an  immense harvest  of  souls.  SS.  Simon  and  Jude  suffered martyrdom  together  in  Persia,  and  their Festivals  are  celebrated  together  on  Oct.  28. JUDGCENOC  (JUDGANOC,  JOUVEN)  (Dec.  13)  
(St.)  

Otherwise  St.  JUDOCUS,  which  see. JUDICAEL  (St.)  King.  (Dec.  17)  
(7th  cent.)  The  son  and  successor  of  King Hoel  of  Brittany,  and  a  monarch  beloved  by his  people.  Abdicating  his  crown,  he  spent the  last  twenty  years  of  his  life  as  a  hermit near  Vannes,  and  passed  away  Dec.  17,  a.d. 658. JUDOCUS  (JUDGANOC,  JOSSE,  &c.)  (Dec.  13)  
(St.)  Hermit.  

(7th  cent.)  Brother  of  King  Judicael  of Brittany,  and  on  the  abdication  of  the  latter for  some  months  occupant  of  the  throne.  Leaving Brittany,  after  making  a  pilgrimage  to  Borne, he  retired  to  a  hermitage  in  Pieardy,  where  he served  God  for  many  years,  dying  A.D.  668. His  tomb,  famous  for  miracles,  was  at  a  place still called St.  Josse-sur-Mer, near  Montrcuil 
JULIA  of  SARAGOSSA  (St.)  M.  (April  16)  

See  SABAGOSSA  (MARTYRS  of). JULIA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  22)  
(5th  cent.)  A  noble  Christian  virgin  of Carthage,  taken  prisoner  by  Genseric  the Vandal  in  the  capture  and  sack  of  that  city (A.D.  439).  She  was  sold  into  Syria  as  a  slave. Her  master,  though  a  Pagan,  treated  her  kindly  ; but  she  had  to  attend  him  in  a  voyage  which ended  in  a  shipwreck  on  the  coast  of  Corsica. There,  she  is  said  to  have  fallen  into  other Pagan  hands,  and  to  have  been  crucified  because of  her  refusal  to  take  part  in  an  idolatrous festival.  There is possibly in the legend a 

confusion  between  two  Saints  of  the  same  name. It  is  historical  that  the  relics  of  St.  Julia  the Martyr  were  in  a.d.  763  translated  from  Corsica to  Brescia  in  Lombardy.  Part  of  them  are  now at  Leghorn,  of  which  city  she  is  the  Patron Saint.

(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  of  Troyes (France),  seized  by  the  soldiers  of  the  Emperor Aurelian  after  his  victory  over  the  usurper, Tetricus  (a.d.  272).  Committed  to  the  charge of  Claudius,  an  officer  in  the  army,  she  succeeded in  converting  him  to  Christianity,  and with  him  was  beheaded  at  Troyes  during  the ensuing  persecution,  set  on  foot  by  Aurelian.

JULIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  7)  
(4th cent.)  A Martyr in the persecution 
under  Diocletian.  She  suffered  about  a.d.  300  ; 
some  say  in  Egypt ; some  say  in  Syria.  No 
reliable  account  of  her  has  come  down  to  us.  

JULIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Dec.  10)  
(4th  cent.)  A  fellow-sufferer  with  St.  Eulalia at  Merida  in  Spain,  under  Diocletian,  about A.D.  303.  

JULIAN  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  7)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Martyr  honoured  at Cagliari  in  Sardinia,  and  whose  relics  were discovered  and  enshrined  in  A.D.  1615.  Locally, he  is  often  styled  Comes  (Count) ;  but  the  reason of  this,  as  well  as  all  other  particulars  about him,  are  lost ;  nor  are  either  the  date  or  the place  of  his  martyrdom  known  to  us.

See  SS.  LUCIAN,  MAXIMIANUS,  &c.  

JULIAN,  BASILISSA,  ANTONIUS,  ANASTASIUS, CELSUS,  MARCIONILLA  and  OTHERS (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  This  holy  company  is  chronicled as  having  suffered  at  Antioch  (but  as  there  are several  cities  of  that  name  it  is  uncertain which  is  referred  to)  under  Diocletian,  in  the first  years  of  the  fourth  century.  Basilissa,  the wife  of  Julian,  is  said  to  have  escaped  and  to have  ended  her  days  in  peace.  Antony,  a  priest, Anastasius,  a  new  convert  to  Christianity, Marcionilla,  a  matron,  with  Celsus,  her  little son  and  seven  other  children,  were  put  to  the torture,  together  with  Julian,  a  prominent citizen,  and  beheaded.  "  At  the  same  time," it  is  added,  "  many  other  Christians  perished at  the  stake." 
JULIAN  SABAS  THE  ELDER  (St.)  (Jan.  14)  
(4th  cent.)  A  celebrated  Syrian  Solitary  who did  much  to  encourage  the  Christians  when persecuted  by  Julian  the  Apostate,  and  the Catholics  in  their  conflict  with  the  Arians. St.  John  Chrysostom  has  left  us  a  magnificent panegyric  of  St.  Julian,  whose  merits  are similarly  enlarged  upon  by  Theodoret.  This St.  Julian  is  probably  identical  with  the  Saint of  the  same  name  commemorated  in  the  Roman Martyrology  on  Oct.  18.  He  died  before  a.d. 380.  

JULIAN  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  27)  

See  SS.  DATIVUS,  JULIAN,  &c.  

JULIAN  of  SORA  (St.)  (Jan.  27)  
(2nd  cent.)  By  birth  a  Dalmatian,  but arrested,  put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded  at Sora  in  Campania,  under  the  Emperor  Antoninus Pius  (a.d.  138-161).  The  inhabitants  of  Atina, a  town  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Sora,  claim him  as  having  really  been  put  to  death  in  their city.  

JULIAN  of  LE  MANS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  27)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Le Mans,  in  the  West  of  France,  an  Apostolic  man and  the  worker  of  many  miracles.  He  is  said to  have  been  a  Bishop  for  forty-seven  years. The  Roman  Martyrology  endorses  the  view  that 
155 

JULIAN 
it  was  St.  Peter  the  Apostle  who  sent  him  and others  into  Gaul  to  preach  Christianity,  and  so puts  his  death  about  A.D.  97.  But  many moderns  hold  that  his  Episcopate  must  be, with  that  of  the  founders  of  other  French churches,  post-dated  to  the  third  century. The  various  English  churches  and  places  entitled St.  Julian's,  and  dating  from  Norman  and Plantagenet  times,  have  this  St.  Julian  for  their Titular  Saint.  

JULIAN  of  CUENQA  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  28)  
(13th  cent.)  "Born  at  Burgos  in  Spain  (A. p. 1127)  on  the  recapture  of  Cuenca  from  the Moors  by  King  Alphonsus  IX  of  Castile,  he  was appointed  Bishop  of  that  city.  In  his  longing to  help  the  poor  and  afflicted  he  is  said  to  have spent  all  his  spare  time  in  earning  money  for them  by  the  work  of  his  hands.  It  is  related that  Christ  Himself  appeared  to  him  in  the guise  of  a  beggar  to  thank  him.  Conspicuous in  life  as  after  death  for  the  miracles  wrought at  his  prayer,  St.  Julian  went  to  his  reward (A.D.  1208).

See  SS.  MODESTUS  and  JULIAN.  

JULIAN  of  LYONS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  13)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Martyr  registered  in the  Roman  Martyrology  as  having  suffered  at, Lyons  in  France,  though  many  maintain  that it  was  at  Nicomedia  in  Asia  Minor  that  he  laid down  his  life  for  Christ.  All  particulars  about him  are  lacking.  

JULIAN  of  EGYPT  and  OTHERS  (SS.) (Feb.  16) MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  It  is  related  of  this  St. Julian  that  he  was  the  leader  of  five  thousand Egyptian  Christians,  who  together  gave  their lives  for  Christ  in  one  of  the  early  persecutions. Some  authors  assert  that  St.  Julian  was  a Bishop  ;  others  that  he  was  an  Abbot ;  but nothing  is  really  known  of  him  and  of  his fellow-sufferers.  

JULIAN  of  OffiSAREA  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  17)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Cappadocia  who (as  Eusebius  relates)  was  present  at  Csesarea  in Palestine  at  the  martyrdom  of  St.  Pamphilus and  his  fellow-sufferers.  Remarking  that  the holy  men  were  only  eleven  in  number,  lacking one  to  make  up  a  company  equal  to  that  of  the Apostles,  St.  Julian  offered  himself  to  the executioners  to  fill  up  the  number.  The  judges intervened,  and  on  Julian  persisting  that  he was  one  in  Faith  and  Hope  with  the  eleven, condemned  him  to  be  roasted  to  death  at  a slow  fire.  He  expired,  thanking  God  for  the grace  bestowed  upon  him  (A.D.  308).

JULIAN  and  EUNUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  27)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Alexandria  in  Egypt under  Decius  (A.D.  250).  Julian,  too  infirm to  walk,  was  carried  to  the  Court  of  Justice by  his  two  slaves.  They  were  both  Christians  ; but  through  fear  one  of  them  apostatised,  while the  other,  Eunus,  bravely  shared  his  master's lot.  They  were  scourged  and  then  burned  to death.  Besas,  a  soldier  in  guard  over  them, was  condemned  and  executed  merely  for  having sought  to  shield  them  from  the  insults  and outrages  of  the  heathen  mob.  We  have  these particulars  from  St.  Denis  of  Alexandria,  a contemporary  and  their  own  Bishop.  

JULIAN  of  TOLEDO  (St.)  Bp.  (March  8)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Toledo  who presided  over  the  Spanish  Church  in  the  time of  the  Visi-Gothic  kings,  from  a.d.  680  to  a.d. 090.  Admirable  for  his  charity  and  kindness to  all,  it  is  related  of  him  that  no  one  ever  came to  him  for  help  but  went  away  comforted  and content.  He  presided  over  two  important Councils  at  Toledo,  and  has  left  not  a  few erudite  and  useful  works,  besides  revising  and developing  the  Mozarabic  Liturgy  then  in  use 
156 

in  Spain.  King  Wamba,  on  becoming  a  monk, received  the  Religious  habit  from  St.  Julian. The  latter  afterwards  wrote  the  Life  of  the saintly  monarch.  

JULIAN  (St.)  M.  (March  16)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  of  senatorial  rank  of Anarzabum  in  Cilicia,  where  he  was  on  account of  his  religion  arrested  under  Diocletian  (a.d. 302,  about),  and  put  to  the  torture,  to  be finally  taken  to  the  coast,  sewn  up  in  a  sack, half-filled  with  scorpions  and  vipers,  and  cast into  the  sea.  His  relics,  recovered  by  the Christians,  were  enshrined  at  Antioch,  where St.  John  Chrysostom  delivered  a  discourse  in his  praise.  

JULIAN  (St.)  M.  (March  23)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Roman  Martyrology styles  this  St.  Julian  a  Confessor,  but  it  appears certain  that  he  was  also  a  Martyr,  though  both the  date  and  the  locality  of  his  Passion  are unknown.  The  assigning  him  to  one  of  the Csesareas  by  Baronius  is  not  borne  out  by  the older  manuscripts.  The  latter  give  him  for fellow-sufferers  two  other  Christians,  by  name Paul  and  Csesaria.

JULIAN  (St.)  (June  9)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  captive,  taken  in some  Western  country  and  sold  into  slavery  in Syria,  who,  on  regaining  his  freedom,  entered a  monastery  in  Mesopotamia,  where  he  profited much  by  the  guidance  of  St.  Ephrem.  After twenty-seven  years  of  a  most  austere  life,  he passed  away  in  high  repute  of  sanctity  (a.d. 370  about).

(8th  cent.;  Ten  Catholic  Christians  (among them,  Maria,  a  Patrician  lady)  who  ventured  to oppose  by  force  the  attempt  of  the  Iconoclasts to  deface  the  picture  of  Our  Blessed  Lord set  up  over  the  Brazen  Gate  of  Constantinople. Seized  by  the  soldiers  and  condemned  by  the judges,  they  were  all  put  to  death  by  order  of the  Emperor  Leo  the  Isaurian  (a.d.  730).

JULIAN  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  25)  
(Date  unknown.)  Baronius  qualifies  him  as 
a  Syrian  priest.  But  nothing  is  really  known 
about  him  ; nor  is  it  easy  to  distinguish  him 
from  the  many  other  Saints  of  the  same  name.  

JULIAN  of  AUVERGNE  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  A  native  of  Vienne  in  France, an  officer  in  the  Imperial  army,  but  secretly  a Christian.  On  relinquishing  military  service, he  withdrew  into  Auvergne,  where  near  Brinde he  suffered  martyrdom  (A.D.  304).  St.  Gregory of  Tours  wrote  his  Life,  and  his  relics  were discovered  and  enslirined  by  St.  Germanus  of Auxerre  (a.d.  431).

JULIAN  (St.)  Hermit.  (Oct.  18)  
(4th  cent.)  This  Saint  is  in  all  likelihood  the famous  St.  Julian  of  Antioch,  on  whose  virtues St.  John  Chrysostom  preached  a  noble  Homily, and  who  is  also  commemorated  on  Jan.  19. But  some  writers  maintain  that  the  St.  Julian of  Oct.  18  was  quite  another  personage.  They describe  him  as  an  Eastern  Solitary,  whose  cell 
JULIUS 

was  at  first  near  Edessa  in  Mesopotamia,  and afterwards  on  Mount  Sinai.  Like  St.  Julian of  Antioch  he  is  admitted  to  have  flourished  in the  fourth  century  and  to  have  acquired  the surname  of  "  Sabas  "  (wise).

The Greeks  commemorate  them  together,  to  the number  of  sixteen,  on  this  day ;  but  so  far  as can  be  ascertained,  they  are  identical  with others  of  the  same  name  registered  in  the Roman  Martyrology  on  various  days ;  SS.

JULIAN  of  APAMJEA  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  9)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Apamsea  in  Syria.  

He  distinguished  himself  in  the  controversies 
with  the  Montanist  and  Cata-Plirygian  heretics 
who  troubled  the  Church  in  the  third  century.  

JULIANA  of  BOLOGNA  (St.)  Widow.  (Feb.  17) (5th  cent.)  A  holy  matron  of  Bologna  in Italy,  whose  piety  and  charity  are  extolled  by St.  Ambrose  of  Milan.  Her  husband,  having with  her  consent  left  her  to  become  a  priest, she  devoted  herself  to  the  bringing  up  of  her four  children  and  to  the  service  of  the  Church and  the  poor.  She  went  to  her  reward  A.D.  435, at  the  age  of  seventy-five.  

JULIANA  (St.)  V.M.  (Feb.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  beheaded (A.D.  306)  with  one  hundred  and  thirty  other Christians,  at  Nicomedia  in  Asia  Minor,  under Diocletian's  colleague,  Maximian  Galerius.  In the  sixth  century  her  relics  were  taken  to Puteoli  near  Naples  ;  but  at  the  present  day several  towns  in  France,  Belgium  and  Portugal claim  to  possess  some  portion  of  them.

♦JULIANA  of  CORNILLON  (Bl.)  V.  (April  6)  
(13th  cent.)  The  humble  Augustinian  nun of  Mount  Cornillon,  near  Liege,  who  was  God's instrument  for  the  institution  in  the  Church  of the  Feast  of  Corpus  Christi,  first  celebrated  at  her petition  (a.d.  1247).  After  being  tried  in  the furnace  of  much  tribulation,  she  fell  asleep  in Christ  (a.d.  1259)  at  the  age  of  sixty-five. JULIANA  FALCONIERI  (St.)  V.  (June  19)  
(14th  cent.)  Born  at  Florence  (a.d.  1270) at  the  age  of  sixteen,  she  renounced  her  great fortune  to  consecrate  herself  entirely  to  God. She  received  the  Religious  habit  from  St. Philip  Benizi,  who  by  means  of  her  built  up  the Third  Order  of  the  Servites,  styled  from  their costume  the  "  Mantellate."  Her  life  was  one of  prayer  and  penance  to  which  she  gave  herself up  utterly  in  every  minute  of  time  left  free to  her  from  her  assiduous  service  of  the  sick  and of  the  poor.  Her  devotion  to  the  Blessed Sacrament,  was  all-absorbing,  and  she  was miraculously  comforted  with  Holy  Viaticum before  she  passed  to  Christ,  her  Spouse  (a.d. 1340).  She  was  canonised  nearly  four  hundred years  afterwards  bv  Pope  Clement  XII.  

♦JULIE  BILLIART  (Bl.)  V.  (April  8)  
(19th  cent.)  Foundress  of  the  Institute  of the  Sisters  of  Notre  Dame  of  Namur.  Born  in Picardy  (a.d.  1751)  of  a  middle-class  family, she  as  a  child  showed  great  signs  of  piety  and sought  to  inspire  her  companions  with  the  love of  virtue.  At  the  age  of  fourteen  she  took  a vow  of  chastity,  and  gave  herself  up  to  the service  and  religious  instruction  of  the  poor. Soon  her  health  completely  broke  down,  and she  remained  a  helpless  cripple  until  miraculously cured  in  a.d.  1804.  During  the  troubled times  of  the  great  French  Revolution  (a.d. 1794)  pious  friends  gathered  round  her  couch seeking  to  give  a  permanent  shape  to  their works  of  charity.  The  Institute  of  Notre-Dame took  form  at  Amiens  in  a.d.  1804.  Its  scope 

is  the  Christian  education  of  girls.  Bl.  Julie met  with  much  opposition  ;  but  steadfast  in her  confidence  in  God,  succeeded  in  establishing her  Institute,  of  which  she  chose  Namur  in Belgium  as  the  centre.  When  she  died  (April  8, a.d.  1816)  her  work  had  taken  firm  root  both in  France  and  Belgium,  whence  it  soon  spread to  England,  America  and  other  countries. She  was  beatified  by  Pope  Pius  X,  A.D.  1906. The  Rules  and  Constitutions  of  the  Sisters  had long  before  been  approved  by  Pope  Gregory XVI.

(4th  cent.)  A  rich  lady  of  Csesarea  in Cappadocia,  part  of  whose  property  was wrongfully  seized  by  a  Pagan.  In  the  Court  of the  local  magistrate,  he  successfully  pleaded  that as  Julitta  was  a  Christian  she  had  no  right  to be  listened  to  by  a  magistrate.  Thereupon she  was  arrested  and,  Joyfully  proclaiming  her Faith,  expired  at  the  stake  (a.d.  303).  By miracle  the  Martyr's  body  was  respected  by the  flames  and  recovered  intact  by  the  Christians, who  secretly  gave  it  honourable  burial.

See  SS.  PAUL,  GERONTIUS, &c.  

JULIUS  of  NOVARA  (St.)  (Jan.  31)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Greek  priest  who,  with  his holy  brother,  the  deacon  Julian,  sojourned  for a  time  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Rome,  and then  authorised  thereto  by  the  Emperor Theodosius,  bu3ied  himself  in  converting heathen  temples  into  Christian  churches,  one of  which  was  on  an  island  in  the  Lago  Maggiore. St.  Julius  died  at  No  vara  in  Piedmont,  some time  after  a.d.  390.  

JULIUS  I  (St.)  Pope.  (April  12)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman,  who  succeeded  St. Mark  (a.d.  337),  and  on  an  appeal  from  the East  justified  St.  Athanasius  against  his  Arian accusers.  He  celebrated  a  Council  in  Rome (a.d.  341)  and  the  more  important  one  at Sardica  (Sofia),  regarded  as  an  Appendix  to that  of  Nicaea.  Throughout  his  Pontificate, St.  Julius  upheld  the  Orthodox  doctrine  concerning the  Most  Holy  Trinity,  and  asserted with  vigour  the  supreme  authority  of  the  See of  Rome,  as  well  in  the  East  as  in  the  West. He  died  A.D.  352.  

JULIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  27)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  veteran  soldier,  martyred  at Dorostorum  (Sillistria)  on  the  Danube,  under Alexander  Severus,  about  a.d.  228.  

JULIUS  and  AARON,  with  OTHERS (July  1) (SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  British  Saints,  of  whom  Julius and  Aaron  suffered  at  Caerleon-on-Usk,  and the  rest  in  different  parts  of  the  country,  during the  persecution  under  Diocletian  (A.D.  303). The  general  persecution  ordered  by  Imperial authority  at  that  period  was  carried  out  with singular  mildness  by  Diocletian's  colleague, the Caesar, Constantius Chlorus, in Britain,

JULIUS 
yet  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  in  the  attempt at  that  period  to  extirpate  Christianity,  a  certain number  of  the  Faithful,  like  St.  Alban, perished  in  Britain.  Tradition  has  preserved the  names  of  Julius  and  Aaron,  mentioned  both by  Gildas  and,  in  his  History,  by  Venerable Bede. JULIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  19)  
(2nd  cent.) A  Roman  Senator,  one  of  the 
few  Martyrs  during  the  respite  from  persecution 
under  the  Emperor  Oommodus (a.d.  180-193).  

He  was  scourged  to  death.

See  SS.  AMBICUS,  VICTOR, &c. JULIUS,  POTAMIA,  CRISPIN,  FELIX,  GRATUS 
and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  Twelve  African  Martyrs,  who suffered  at  Thagura  in  Numidia,  in  the  persecution under  Diocletian  (a.d.  302),  about  the  same time  as  St.  Crispina  in  the  neighbouring  town  of 
JULIUS  (St'.)  M.  (Dec.  20)  

Nothing  has  survived  regarding  this  holy Martyr,  who  is  registered  in  the  Martyrologies as  having  suffered  at  Gelduta  in  Thrace,  though it  is  difficult  to  identify  the  locality.  Pliny describes  Gelduta  as  being  situated  on  the banks  of  the  Rhine.  

♦JUNIAN  (St.)  Hermit.  (Oct.  16)  
(5th  cent.)  A  hermit  in  France  endued  in life  with  great  powers  of  working  miracles,  and much  venerated  at  Limoges  and  in  the  surrounding districts.  He  is  believed  to  have  lived far  into  the  sixth  century.  A  small  town  near Limoges  takes  its  name  from  him.  

♦JURMIN  (St.)  (Feb.  23)  
(8th  cent,  probably.)  An  East  Anglian Prince,  perhaps  a  brother  of  St.  Etheldreda,  or again,  a  nephew  of  St.  Hilda.  His  relics  were venerated  at  Bury  St.  Edmunds  throughout the  Middle  Ages  as  those  of  a  Saint.  But  no other  particulars  regarding  him  are  extant.  

JUST  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  18)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Title-Saint  of  a  parish near  Land's  End  in  Cornwall,  described  as  a Martyr,  and  possibly  identical  with  the  St. Just,  a  Boy-Martyr,  commemorated  in  the Roman  Martyrology  on  Oct.  18.  But  the tradition  concerning  St.  Just  of  Cornwall  is too  vague  to  be  of  anv  service  historically.  

JUSTA,  JUSTINA  and  HENEDINA  (SS.) (May  14) MM.  

(2nd  cent.)  Saints  (some  say,  sisters) venerated  in  the  Island  of  Sardinia,  where they  suffered  martyrdom  (it  is  believed)  under Hadrian  (a.d.  117-138),  either  at  Cagliari  or  at

JUSTA  and  RUFINA  (SS.)  VV.MM.  (July  19)  
(3rd  cent.)  Two  poor  tradeswomen  of  Seville in  Spain,  victims  (a.d.  287)  of  the  persecution under  Diocletian  at  its  very  outset.  They  are greatly  honoured  in  the  Mozarabic  Liturgy, and  in  the  Spanish  Church  in  general.  After being  racked  they  were  tlirown  into  prison. St.  Justa  expired  in  consequence  of  the  torture to  which  she  had  already  been  subjected ; St.  Rufina  was  strangled  in  her  dungeon.  

JUSTIN  of  CHIETI  (St.)  (Jan.  1)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Some  writers  describe him  as  first  Bishop  of  Chieti  (South  of  Italy), and  as  having  lived  in  the  first  half  of  the fourth  century.  Others  have  it  that  he  flourished about  A.D.  540.  The  fact  that  he  has been  from  time  immemorial  venerated  at  Chieti led  Pope  Benedict  XIV,  after  due  investigation, to  order  the  inserting  of  his  name  in  the  Roman Martyrology.  

JUSTIN  THE  PHILOSOPHER  (St.)  M.  (April  13) (2nd  cent.)  Born  near  Sichem  in  Palestine, and  hence  styling  himself  a  "  Samaritan,"  he, from  his  youth,  gave  himself  up  to  philosophical meditations.  He  was  converted  to  Christianity, and  seems  after  a  visit  to  Rome  to  have  engaged 
158 

in  missionary  work  in  Asia.  His  inimitable Apologies  for  the  Christian  Religion,  addressed to  the  Antonine  Emperors,  and  his  Dialogue with  the  Jew  Tryphon  are  the  most  instructive second  century  writings  which  we  possess.  St. Justin  was  beheaded  in  Rome  with  other Christians  (a.d.  167). JUSTIN  (St.)  M.  (July  18)  

One  of  the  Seven  Sons  of  St.  SYMPHOROSA, zvlvich  s&@ JUSTIN  (JUSTUS)  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  1)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  child  from  Auxerre (France)  who,  journeying  from  Paris  to  Amiens with  his  father,  fell  in  with  the  officials  employed in  the  search  for  Christians.  The  little  fellow stoutly  refused  to  betray  the  direction  in  which his  father  had  fled.  The  latter  escaped,  but  little Justin  was  made  to  die  in  his  place  (about a.d.  288),  at  a  spot  some  four  leagues  from Paris.  The  old  account  goes  on  to  add  that her  little  son's  head  was  returned  to  his  mother at  Auxerre. JUSTIN  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  17)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  priest  who  busied  himself with  the  burying  of  the  bodies  of  Martyrs, and  eventually  himself  shared  their  lot  (a.d. 259).  His  relics  were  translated  in  the  ninth century  to  Frisingen  in  Germany. JUSTIN  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  12)

JUSTINA  of  PADUA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  7)  
(1st cent.)  According to the traditional 
account,  this  Christian  maiden  suffered  either 
under  Nero  or  under  Domitian,  certainly  in  the 
Apostolic Age.  She was converted to the 
Faith  by  St.  Prosdocimus,  sent  by  St.  Peter 
the  Apostle  to  Padua,  and  first  Bishop  of  that 
city.  She  was  beheaded  by  order  of  Maximus 
the  Prefect,  a  fierce  opponent  of  Christianity.  

Her relics are enshrined in the magnificent 
church  erected  in  her  honour  by  the  Cassines 
Benedictines, in whose adjoining monastery 
their  congregation  originated.  

JUSTINA  (St.)  V.M.  (Nov.  30)  
(Date  unknown.) A  Christian  maiden  put 
to  death  for  the  Faith  at  Constantinople ; but 
the  date  and  all  particulars  are  lost.  

♦JUSTINIAN  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  5)  
(6th  cent.) A  hermit,  a  native  of  Brittany, 
but  who  served  God  in  an  island  off  the  coast 
of  South  Wales,  where  he  met  his  death  at  the 
hands of evildoers, and was thenceforward 
venerated  as  a  Martyr.

(6th cent,) The first Bishop of Urgel in 
Catalogna. He  is  numbered  by  St.  Isidore  of 
Seville  among  the  "  viri  illustres  "  of  whom  he 
wrote the lives.  St. Justus has left us an 
Exposition  of  the  Canticle  of  Canticles.  He 
attended  the  Second  Council  of  Toledo  (a.d.  

527) ;  but  the  date  of  his  death  is  unknown.  

JUSTUS  (St.)  M.  (July  2)  

Sec  SS.  ARISTO,  CRESCENTIANUS, &c. JUSTUS  (St.)  M.  (July  14)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Roman  born,  miraculously converted  to  Christianity,  and  a  soldier  in  the Imperial  army.  This  may  have  brought  him into  the  East.  There  is  no  local  tradition  in regard  to  him  in  Rome,  though  it  is  there  that he  is  said  to  have  suffered  martyrdom.  His head  is  alleged  to  have  been  crushed  in  under  a red-hot  helmet.  No  dates  are  given.  He  was in  great  honour  at  Constantinople  ;  and  perhaps it  was  there,  in  "  New  Rome,"  that  his  Passion really  took  place.

(4th  cent.)  Two  Christian  children,  aged respectively  thirteen  and  nine  years,  who  were not  spared  in  the  incredibly  savage  persecution under  Diocletian.  They,  like  countless  others of  the  Faithful,  were  scourged  and  beheaded by  order  of  the  merciless  Prefect  Dacianus  at Alcala  in  Spain,  about  a.d.  304. JUSTUS  of  LYONS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  From  being  a  deacon  of  Vienne, Justus  was  promoted  (a.d  350)  to  the  See  of Lyons.  He  assisted  (a.d.  381)  at  the  Council of  Aquileia  against  the  Arians.  Thence,  disguising himself,  he  repaired  unknown  to  any one  to  Egypt,  and  embraced  the  monastic  life. However,  he  was  before  very  long  discovered ; and  his  priests  and  people  sent  to  him  to  beg of  him  to  return  to  them.  This,  we  are  assured he  persistently  refused  to  do,  and  died  in  his monastery  (a.d.  390).  His  body  was  afterwards translated  to  Lyons. JUSTUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  18)  

The St. JUSTINUS, the child-martyr  of near  Paris,  previously  commemorated  in  the Martyrologies  on  August  1. JUSTUS  of  TRIESTE  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  A  citizen  of  Trieste,  arrested  as a  Christian  during  the  persecution  under Diocletian.  He  was  imprisoned,  put  to  the torture,  and  finally  cast  into  the  sea  (a.d.  303). He  is  much  honoured  at  Trieste,  where  a  noble church  is  entitled  after  him. JUSTUS  of  CANTERBURY  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  10) (7th  cent.)  A  Roman  monk,  one  of  those sent  by  St.  Gregory  the  Great  (A.D.  601)  to reinforce  the  mission  of  St.  Augustine  to  the Anglo-Saxons.  In  604  he  was  consecrated  first Bishop  of  Rochester ;  and  in  624  succeeded St.  Mellitus  at  Canterbury.  He  died  A.D.  627, having  begun,  through  St.  Paulinus,  whom  he consecrated  first  Archbishop  of  York,  the Apostolate  of  Northumbria,  later  to  be  taken up  by  St.  Aidan.  Pope  St.  Boniface  IV,  his contemporary,  in  a  letter  still  extant,  speaks  of him  in  terms  of  high  praise. JUSTUS  and  ABUNDIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  Spanish  Saints  who  suffered under  the  Emperor  Numerian  and  the  Prefect Olybrius  (a.d.  283).  After  a  futile  attempt to  burn  them  at  the  stake,  they  were  beheaded. The  Mozarabic  Liturgy  has  a  solemn  Office  in their  honour. *JUTHWARE  (St.)  V.  (July  1)  
(7th  cent.)  The  sister  of  St.  Sidwell.  They were  probably  of  British  and  not  of  AngloSaxon  lineage,  and  appear  to  have  lived  in Devonshire  before  the  Anglo-Saxons  of  Wessex had  penetrated  into  that  county. JUVENAL  of  NARNI  (St.)  Bp.  (May  3)  
(4th  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Narni  (Central Italy),  ordained,  it  is  asserted,  by  Pope  St. Damasus.  He  converted  great  numbers  of Pagans  to  Christianity  ;  and,  having  wrought many  miracles,  fell  asleep  in  Christ,  a.d.  369. His  body  is  alleged  to  have  been  translated to  Toulouse  in  France,  but  relics  of  him  are still  venerated  at  Narni.  He  is  associated  in the  Liturgy  with  the  Martyrs  Pope  St.  Alexander and  his  fellow-sufferers  ;  but  there  is  no  ground for  the  erroneous  belief  that  St.  Juvenal  also perished  by  the  sword. JUVENAL  (St.)  M.  (May  7)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Saint  of  Narni,  a  deacon  of Pope  St.  Alexander  (a.d.  121-132),  according  to some.  But  this  appears  improbable.  Others hold  with  more  likelihood  that  he  was  a  Bishop of  Teramo.  His  reputed  shrine  is  at  Benevento. JUVENTINUS  and  MAXIMUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  25) (4th  cent.)  Two  Christian  officers  in  the army of Julian the Apostate.  Like others, 

they  were  degraded,  imprisoned,  scourged,  and at  last  beheaded  (a.d.  363).  Their  martyrdom took  place  at  Antioch  in  Syria.  

JUVENTIUS  of  PAVIA  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  8)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  tradition  is  that  St. Hermagoras,  Bishop  of  Aquileia,  the  disciple of  St.  Mark  the  Evangelist,  despatched  SS. Syrus  and  Juventius  to  evangelise  Pavia (Ticinum),  of  which  city  the  latter  became  the first  Bishop.  Consequently,  he  flourished  in the  first  or,  at  latest,  early  in  the  second century.  The  Roman  Martyrology  commemorates him  a  second  time  with  St.  Syrus  on  Sept.  8.  

JUVENTIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  1)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Roman  Martyr,  of  whom all  particulars  are  lacking.  His  body,  discovered in  the  Catacombs  in  the  sixteenth  century,  was conveyed  to  the  monastery  of  Chaise-Dieu (Evreux)  in  France,  the  date  of  which  event  has determined  that  of  his  festival.  

♦JUVENAL  ANCINA  (Bl.)  Bp.  (Sept.  12)  
(17th  cent.)  By  birth  a  Piedmontese,  and  a very  learned  man,  who  coming  to  Rome  became a  disciple  of  St.  Philip  Neri  and  one  of  the  first members  of  the  Congregation  of  the  Oratory. His  indefatigable  zeal  in  preaching  resulted  in  a wonderful  gain  of  souls  to  God.  Appointed Bishop  of  Saluzzo,  he  was  recognised  as  one  of the  model  Prelates  of  his  Age.  He  died  a.d. 1604  at  the  age  of  fifty-nine.  The  Process  of his  Beatification  was  completed  a.d.  1890.

♦KEVOCA  (KENNOTHA,  QUIVOCA)  (St.)  (May  1)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  or  Scottish  Saint  of whom  nothing  is  now  known  with  any  certainty. Some  writers  identify  him  with  St.  Mocaemog, Abbot  of  Liathmor  in  Tipperary.  But  in  the ancient  Scottish  Calendars  St.  Kevoca  appears as  a  female  Saint.
♦KEWE  (KYWA,  CIWA)  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  8)  

Otherwise  St.  KIGWE,  which  see.
♦KEYNA  (KEYNE,  KEAN)  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  8)

After  a  holy  life, spent  as  a  recluse  in  Somersetshire  (at  Keynsham,  so-called  after  her)  she  returned  to  Wales to  die.  Many  churches  are  dedicated  in  her honour. KIARAN  (KYRAN)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  9)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  surnamed  Saighir (Segienus),  and  who  appears  in  the  Roman Martyrology  as  Queranus.  He  was  trained  in the  monastic  life  by  St.  Finnian  of  Clonard,  who foretold  that  half  the  monasteries  of  Ireland would  receive  a  Rule  from  him.  This  Rule, 
160 

"  The  Law  of  Kieran,"  like  those  of  other Celtic  Saints,  is  austere  in  the  extreme.  Among the  monasteries  founded  by  St.  Kyran  was  the famous  Abbey  of  Clonmacnois  in  West  Meath, on  the  Shannon.  St.  Kyran  died  Sept,  9, a.d.  549.  

♦KIERAN  (KIERNAN,  KYRAN,  CIARAN,  PYRAN) (St.)  Bp.  (March  5)  
(5th  cent.)  Styled  "  The  First-Born  of  the Saints  of  Ireland."  Born  in  Ossory  of  noble parents,  some  time  in  the  fourth  century,  he preceded  St.  Patrick,  with  whom  he  associated himself  in  the  Apostolate  of  Ireland.  Either by  St.  Patrick,  or,  as  some  say,  by  the  Pope  of the  time  himself,  St.  Kieran  was  consecrated First  Bishop  of  Ossory.  From  his  foundation of  a  monastery  at  Saighir  (King's  County)  he became  known  as  St.  Kiaran  of  Saighir.  Various traditions  speak  of  his  having  crossed  over  to Cornwall  and  of  his  being  identical  with  the St  Piran  there  venerated  as  a  local  Saint. St.  Kyran  died,  it  would  appear,  at  a  very advanced  age.  

♦KIGWE  (KEWE)  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  8)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Marked  in  the  Exeter Martyrology  as  commemorated  on  Feb.  8. She  is  probably  the  same  as  St.  Ciwa,  a  sixth or  seventh  century  Saint  venerated  in  Monmouthshire. A  Welsh  Kalendar  gives  the  name Kigwe  or  Kigwoe.  It  is  also  written  Ciwg  and Cwick.  But  she  is  certainly  other  than  the  St. Keyna  who  has  left  her  name  to  Keynsham  in Somersetshire.  

♦KIARA  (CHIER)  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  16)  
(7th  cent.) An  Irish  Saint,  directed  in  the

♦KILDA  (St.).  

This  Saint  gives  its  name  to  an  island  off  the Scottish  coast,  in  which  there  is  a  well  known as  St.  Kilder's  or  St.  Kilda's  Well.  But  the Saint  has  not  been  identified.  

KILLIAN  (CHILIANUS),  COLOMAN  and  TOTNAN (SS.)  MM.  (July  8)

The  Saint  had  converted  Gerbert,  the local  Duke  or  chieftain  ;  but  made  an  enemy of  the  heathen  Geilana,  who  lived  with  the Duke  as  his  wife,  though  not  really  such.  She caused  St.  Chillian  to  be  assassinated,  and  with him  Coloman,  a  priest,  and  Totnan,  a  deacon (A.d.  688).  Their  relics,  a  century  later,  were enshrined  in  his  Cathedral  by  St.  Burchard, a  successor  of  St.  Killian.

St.  Kinga  died,  a  Tertiary  of the  Order  of  St.  Francis,  in  the  monastery  she had  founded  at  Sandiez.  Her  name  is  variously written,  Kioga,  Zinga,  Cunegonda,  &c.  

♦KINGSMARK  (CYNFARCH)  (St.)  (Sept.  8)  
(5th  cent.)  One  or  two  chapels  or  churches in  the  West  country  are  dedicated  to  him,  and there  is  a  place-name  commemorating  him. He  is  said  to  have  been  a  Scottish  chieftain, and  to  have  afterwards  come  to  Wales,  where, 
LANDRADA 

remaining  in  the  world,  he  sanctified  himself 
and  acquired  such  popular  repute  for  holiness 
as  after  his  death  to  have  heen  at  once  canonised 
by  the  clergy  and  people.  He,  it  would  seem, 
married a grand-daughter of the  famous 
Brychan  of  Brecknock.

He  was  there instructed  by  St.  Molua  in  Sacred  Science,  and appointed  by  St.  Comgall  to  make  other  foundations, over  one  of  which,  at  a  place  called Achadh-Ur  (now  Freshford,  County  Kilkenny), he  presided  till  his  holy  death  (a.d.  672).  He worked  many  miracles,  raising  the  dead  to  life, and  in  many  parts  of  Ireland  is  invoked  effectually on  the  part  of  paralytics  and  of  those possessed  by  evil  spirits. *LACY  (WILLIAM)  (Bl.)

(7th  cent.)  Born  in  the  north  of  France,  he gave  up  a  high  post  at  the  Court  of  King Clotaire  III  to  become  a  monk  of  Fontenelle, which  monastery  he  governed  as  Abbot  for twelve  years.

The  official  persecution  under  Diocletian  had at  that  time  practically  ceased  in  the  West. Hence,  it  is  supposed  that  St.  Lambert  perished in  a  riot  of  the  Pagans,  irritated  at  the  tolerance of  Christians  that  had  set  in.  

LAMBERT  of  MAESTRICHT  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.17) (7th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Theodardus, Bishop  of  Maestricht,  whom  he  succeeded  in a.d.  669.

Recalled  to  his  See  by  Pepin of  Heristal,  he  set  about  his  work  with  renewed zeal,  and  energetically  promoted  the  missionary efforts  of  St.  Willebrord  and  others  in  the neighbouring  Pagan  districts.  For  his  energy in  repressing  vice  he  paid  with  his  life,  being  slain by  a  troop  of  lawless  nobles  (a.d.  709)  in  the  then village  of  Ltege,  whither  his  relics  were  transported from  Maestricht,  a.d.  720 ;  and  wliich, having  become  shortly  afterwards  an  Episcopal city,  honours  St.  Lambert  as  its  chief  Patron.

He  entered  an  austere  monastery  and,  having been  promoted  to  the  priesthood,  retired  to  a desert  place  on  the  River  Sambre,  where  he founded  the  Abbey  of  Lobbes  (Laubacum),  of which  he  gave  the  government  to  St.  Wismar, and  later  that  of  Crepy  (Crespiacum)  where  he died  A.d.  686.  Like  his  saintly  contemporaries of  the  North-East  of  France  and  of  Belgium, St.  Landelinus  was  a  zealous  missionary  and unsparing  of  himself  in  his  efforts  to  convert the  heathen.  

LANDOALDUS  and  AMANTIUS  (SS.)  (March  19) (7th  cent.)  A  Roman  priest  and  a  deacon, sent  in  the  middle  of  the  seventh  century  by Pope  St.  Martin  I  to  work  with  SS.  Amandus, Aubert,  Remaclus  and  others,  at  the  evangelisation of  the  countries  now  known  as  Belgium and  North-Eastern  France.  To  this  task  the two  Saints  devoted  themselves  with  great  fruit of  souls,  and  many  miracles  are  attributed  to their  prayers.  Their  relics  were  taken  to Ghent  in  the  tenth  centurv.

(6th  cent.)  A  holy  nun  in  Ireland,  niece  of St.  Forchera.  St.  Lasar  was  in  early  life  placed under  the  care  of  SS.  Finnian  and  Kiernan  at Clonard.  Her  name,  signifying  "  Flame," testifies  to  the  ardent  love  of  her  soul  for  her Divine  Spouse. *LASERIAN  (MOLAISRE)  (St.)  Bp. (April  18)  
(7th  cent.)  A  nephew  of  St.  Blaan  (Dunblane), and  an  Irishman  by  birth,  who  is  said  to have  been  ordained  priest  in  Rome  by  Pope St.  Gregory  the  Great.  Returning  to  Ireland, he  founded  the  monastery  and  Bishopric  of Leighlin.  He  was  afterwards  by  Pope  Honorius appointed  his  Legate  in  Ireland,  where  he strenuously  upheld  the  Roman  practice  in  regard to  the  celebration  of  Easter.  He  was  prominent at  the  Synod  of  Whitefleld,  A.D.  635,  and  is venerated  as  the  Patron  of  the  Diocese  of Leighlin. LATINUS  of  BRESCIA  (St.)  Bp.  (March  24)  
(2nd  cent.)  Flavius  Latinus,  disciple  and successor  of  St.  Viator,  third  Bishop  of  Brescia in  Lombardy,  is  believed  to  have  been  imprisoned and  put  to  the  torture  with  other  Christians, under  Domitian  ;  to  have  escaped  with his  life,  and  to  have  governed  the  Diocese  of Brescia  from  a.d.  84  to  A.D.  115.  His  relics, discovered  in  the  fifteenth  century,  under  an altar  in  a  chapel,  standing  in  what  had  been the  cemetery  traditionally  alleged  to  have  been set  apart  by  him  for  the  interment  of  the  bodies of  Martyrs,  are  now  fittingly  enshrined  in  the same  locality  in  the  church  of  St.  Afra.

♦LAUNOMAR  (LAUMER)  (St.)  Abbot. (Jan.  19)  
(6th  cent.) An  Abbot  in  France  favoured 
with  the  grace  of  working  miracles  and  with 
the  gift  of  prophecy.  He  died  in  his  monastery 
near  Chartres,  a.d.  593.  

LAURENCE  JUSTINIANI  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  8)  
(15th  cent.)  A  scion  of  a  noble  Venetian family  who,  at  the  age  of  nineteen,  being  already favoured  with  the  grace  of  supernatural  prayer, joined  the  austere  Congregation  of  the  Canons Regular  of  St.  Giorgio  in  Alga,  of  which  in  due time  he  became  the  General.  Pope  Eugene  IV (a.d.  1433)  compelled  him  to  accept  the  Bishopric of  Venice,  of  which  city  he  became  the  first Patriarch,  when  that  dignity  was  transferred from  Grado  to  Venice  (A.D.  1451).  St.  Laurence, by  his  zeal  for  the  salvation  of  the  souls  committed to  his  charge,  was  the  model  of  the  Prelates of  his  age  ;  but  his  private  life  was  ever  one of  penance  and  high  prayer.  His  writings  on Mystical  Contemplation  are  sublime  in  their simplicity.  He  died  mourned  by  all,  Jan.  8, A.D.  1455,  at  the  age  of  seventy-four,  and  was canonised  A.d.  1690. LAURENCE  of  CANTERBURY  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  2)  
(7th  cent.)  One  of  the  forty  monks  sent by  Pope  St.  Gregory  the  Great  with  St.  Augustine to  convert  the  Anglo-Saxons.  He  enjoyed the  full  confidence  of  his  holy  leader,  and  was chosen  by  him  to  report  to  St.  Gregory  on  the progress  of  the  English  mission,  and  to  bring back  reinforcements  for  the  work.  Succeeding  i to  the  Archbishopric  of  Canterbury  (A.D.  604),

he  guided  the  infant  Church  successfully  and skilfully  through  the  crisis  that  followed  on  the death  of  King  Ethelbert.  He  appears  to  have dealt  very  prudently  with  the  Celtic  Prelates  ; and  the  Irish  Stowe  Missal  gives  him  express commemoration  in  the  Canon  of  the  Mass. He  died  a.d.  619,  and  was  succeeded  by  St. Mellitus.  

LAURENCE  of  NOVARA  and  OTHERS  (April  30) (SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  St.  Laurence  was  a  native  of Novara  in  Piedmont,  of  which  city  his  disciple St.  Gaudentius  became  the  first  Bishop.  He made  many  converts  to  Christianity,  and  in  the end  was  put  to  death  for  the  Faith,  together (we  are  told)  with  a  number  of  children  whom he  had  just  baptised.

This  holy  man,  whose  real surname  was  Johnson,  was  born  in  Lancashire, and  won  a  Fellowship  in  one  of  the  Oxford Colleges.  He  was  ordained  priest  at  Douai, and  afterwards,  taking  the  name  of  Richardson, faithfully  served  on  the  English  Mission.  When offered  pardon  if  he  would  confess  having  taken part  in  a  pretended  plot  against  Queen  Elizabeth his  answer  was  :  "I  cannot  confess  an  untruth  ; neither  can  I  deny  my  Faith."  He  was  put  to death  at  Tyburn,  A.D.  1582.  

LAURENCE  of  BRINDISI  (St.)  (July  22)  
(17th  cent.)  An  Italian  Capuchin  Saint, born  at  Brindisi,  who  seemed  to  live  for  no other  end  than  to  gain  souls  to  Christ.  He travelled  over  nearly  the  whole  of  Europe, converting  thousands  of  unbelievers  and  drawing countless  sinners  to  repentance.  He  died  at Lisbon,  a.d.  1619,  and  was  canonised  by  Pope Leo  XIII  (A.D.  1881).  

LAURENCE  of  ROME  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  10)  
(3rd  cent.)  Perhaps  the  most  celebrated among  the  many  Martyrs  of  Rome.  Claimed by  the  Spaniards  as  their  fellow-countryman, he  was  Archdeacon  to  Pope  St.  Xystus  II, and  as  such  administered  the  Temporals  of the  Holy  See.  When  St.  Xystus,  with  most of  his  clergy,  was  put  to  death  under  Valerian (a.d.  258),  St.  Laurence  was  spared  for  a  few days  with  the  view  of  forcing  him  to  discover and  give  up  the  supposed  concealed  treasures of  the  Church.  When  it  was  found  that  all had  been  shared  among  the  poor,  the  holy  deacon was  put  to  the  torture,  and  in  the  end  roasted alive  on  a  gridiron.  The  East  has  vied  with the  West  in  doing  honour  to  him.  His  body rests  in  the  Campus  Varan  us  (Cimitero  di S.  Lorenzo) ;  but  fragments  of  his  relics  are found  throughout  Europe,  notably  in  the Palace  of  the  Kings  of  Spain  known  as  the "  Escurial  "  (Gridiron).

(12th  cent.)  Of  princely  descent,  born  in Leinster  about  A.D.  1124.  After  being  Abbot of  Glendalough,  he  was  consecrated  Archbishop of  Dublin  (A.D.  1154).  He  guided  his  flock wisely,  encouraging  them  to  patience  in  the sufferings  consequent  on  the  invasion  of  Strongbow  ;  and  governed  his  Diocese  with  prudence for  twenty-six  years.  Repairing  in  the  interests of  his  Church,  to  Canterbury,  to  King  Henry II,  he  narrowly  escaped  death  at  the  hands  of a  madman.  He  was  present  in  Rome  (a.d. 1179)  at  the  Lateran  Council,  and  returned  to Ireland  with  the  powers  of  a  Legate.  He  died at  the  Abbey  of  Eu  in  Normandy  (14  Nov., a.d.  1180),  having  successfully  negotiated between  King  Henry  and  King  Roderic,  the Irish  monarch.  He  was  canonised  (a.d.  1226 by  Pope  Honorius  III,  who  put  on  record, among  the  miracles  worked  at  the  prayer  of St.  Laurence,  the  raising  of  seven  dead  persons to  life.

It  seems certain  that  he  met  his  death  somewhere  in France,  probably  at  Bourges  ;  but  the  accounts given  of  him  are  so  unreliable  that  no  faith can  be  given  to  them.

The  holiness  of  his  life of  prayer  and  penance  led  to  his  being  venerated by  his  people  as  a  Saint. LAUTO  (LAUDO,  LAUDUS,  LO)  (April  22)

(6th  cent.)  For  forty  years  (a.d.  528-a.d. 568)  Bishop  of  Coutances  in  Normandy,  he assisted  at  several  French  Councils.  He  was present  at  the  deathbeds  of  his  friends,  the Bishops,  St.  Melanius  of  Rouen  and  St.  Paternus of  Avranehes  ;  as  also  at  that  of  the  Abbot St.  Marculphus.  He  enriched  his  Church  out of  his  family  property  at  Briovere,  now  called after  him  St.  Lo.  He  appears  to  have  been  one of  the  most  energetic  as  well  as  one  of  the most  loved  sixth  centurv  Prelates.

LAZARUS  of  MILAN  (St.)  Bp.  *  (Feb.  11)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Milan  who was  the  support  of  his  flock  during  the  invasion of  the  Ostro-Goths.  By  his  zeal  he  won  during his  eleven  years  of  Episcopate  the  love  and admiration  of  all.  To  him,  as  to  St.  Mamertus of  Vienne,  is  attributed  the  institution  of  the Rogation  Days.  He  died  March  14,  A.D.  429  ; but  his  Feast  Day  was  fixed  on  Feb.  11,  in deference  to  the  Milanese  usage  of  not  keeping Saints'  Days  in  Lent. LAZARUS  (St.)  (Feb.  23)  
(9th  cent.)  A  monk  of  Constantinople, renowned  as  a  painter,  who  in  the  time  of Theophilus  (a.d.  829-842),  one  of  the  Iconoclast Emperors,  busied  himself  in  restoring the  Sacred  Pictures  defaced  by  the  heretics. He  was  seized  and  put  to  the  torture.  But  his right  hand,  burned  off,  was  miraculously restored  to  his  arm,  and,  escaping  with  his  life, he  persevered  to  the  end  in  his  brave  struggle for  the  Faith,  passing  away  in  great  repute  of zeal  and  ascetic  holiness.

See  SS.  ZANITAS,  LAZARUS, &c. LAZARUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  17)  
(1st  cent.)  The  disciple  and  friend  of  our Lord,  by  Him  raised  from  the  dead  (John  xi.). Although  the  Greek  historians  allege  that  he passed  from  this  world  in  the  Island  of  Cyprus, it  has  been  a  constant  belief  in  the  West  that, with  his  holy  sisters,  Mary  and  Martha,  he journeyed  into  Gaul  and  was  the  first  Apostle of  the  South  of  France,  he  himself  becoming Bishop  of  Marseilles.  Of  this  city,  as  of  others in  France,  he  is  held  to  be  the  Patron  Saint. The  Military  Order  of  St.  Lazarus,  of  which  the original  object  was  the  care  of  lepers  (whence 

the  word  "  Lazaretto  "),  has  left  a  trace  in  the style  of  the  Sardinian  Order  of  SS.  Maurice  and 
LEA  (St.)  Widow.  (March  22)  
(4th  cent.)  A  rich  Roman  lady  who,  after the  death  of  her  husband,  mortified  her  flesh by  the  wearing  of  sackcloth  and  by  the  passing of  entire  nights  in  prayer.  In  her  humility she  made  herself  the  menial  servant  of  every one  in  her  household.  She  died  a.d.  384. St.  Jerome,  her  contemporary,  makes  an edifying  comparison  between  her  holy  end  and that  of  the  Consul  Prsetextatus,  a  heathen, who  died  at  the  same  hour.

Fulgentius  and  Isidore,  the  latter  of  whom succeeded  him  in  the  See  of  Seville.  He  entered a  monastery  in  his  early  youth,  and  persevered in  prayer  and  penance  until,  on  account  of  his eminence  in  virtue  and  his  proficiency  in  sacred learning,  he  was  promoted  to  the  Archbishopric of  Seville.  He  reformed  the  Mozarabic  or Spanish  Liturgy,  was  prominent  at  the  Third Council  of  Toledo  (a.d.  589),  and  was  under God,  the  chief  means  of  converting  the  Spanish Visi-Goths  from  the  errors  of  Arianism.

She  seems  to  have  lived  at  a  very  early  period, and  to  have  been  connected  with  the  Dioceses of  Limerick  and  Kerry.  Some  suppose  her  to have  been  a  sister  of  St.  Munchin  of  Limerick. Several  place-names  in  Ireland  perpetuate  her memory ;  and  she  is  still  in  great  popular veneration.

LEO  of  CATANIA  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  20)  
(8th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Ravenna  who,  on account  of  his  many  merits,  was  appointed to  be  Bishop  of  Catania  in  Sicily.  He  was  a Prelate  of  great  learning,  and  his  reputation  as a  man  of  God  was  so  widespread  that  the Byzantine  Emperor  (probably  Constantine Copronymus)  invited  him  to  his  Court  and besought  his  prayers.  By  the  miracles  he worked  he  acquired  the  surname  of  "  Thaumaturgus  "  (Wonderworker).  Be  passed  away some  time  before  a.d.  787.  

LEO,  ABUNDANTIUS,  NICEPHORUS,  DONATUS and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  1)

LEO 
His  tomb  was  discovered  outside  the  walls  of Rome  in  1857,  and  verses  cut  in  the  stone  tell us  that  he  had  married  while  still  a  heathen, and  that  he  lived  to  the  age  of  eighty.  His body,  however,  had  been  removed  and  enshrined in  one  of  the  churches  of  Rome  as  early  as  the ninth  century.  

♦LEO  of  ROUEN  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (March  1)

LEO  I,  THE  GREAT  (St.)  Pope,  Doctor  of  the Church.  (April  11)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth  and  Archdeacon of  the  Holy  City  under  Popes  St. Celestine  and  Sixtus  III.  On  the  demise  of the  latter  (a.d.  440)  he  was  elected  Pope.  He repressed  the  Manichseans  and  insisted  (against the  custom  already  establishing  itself)  that they  should  partake  of  the  Chalice  at  Holy Communion.  He  also  crushed  the  last  vestiges of  Pelagianism  in  Italy.  But  his  great  achievement was  the  Oecumenical  Council  of  Chalcedon (a.d.  451),  summoned  by  him,  which  gave  its deathblow  to  the  heresy  of  Eutyches,  who  denied that  Christ  was  truly  man.  By  himself  bravely seeking  out  Attila  the  Hun,  Pope  Leo  saved Rome  from  destruction  ;  and  soon  after  also succeeded  in  mitigating  the  horrors  of  the  sack of  the  city  by  the  hordes  of  Genseric  the  Vandal. St.  Leo  died  April  11,  A.D.  461,  and  rests  in St.  Peter's.  More  than  a  hundred  of  his eloquent  sermons  are  still  extant.  

LEO  IX. (St.)  Pope.  (April  19)  
(11th  cent.)  A  cousin  of  the  Emperor  Conrad the  Salic,  born  in  Alsace,  and  in  Baptism  named Bruno.  He  was  brought  up  by  Berthold,  the learned  Bishop  of  Toul,  and  succeeded  him  in that  See  (a.d.  1026).  As  Bishop  he  revived discipline  among  the  clergy  and  reformed  many monasteries.  On  the  death  of  Pope  Damasus II  (A.D.  1048)  he  was  constrained  against  his own  will  to  accept  the  Headship  of  the  Church, and  took  with  him  to  Rome,  as  his  spiritual adviser,  Hildebrand,  the  future  St.  Gregory  VII. As  Pope  he  combated  simony,  then  rife  in Europe  ;  and  formally  condemned  the  heresy of  Berengarius  on  the  Eucharist.  Notwithstanding all  his  efforts,  he  was  unable  to  hinder the  consummation  of  the  Greek  Schism  then being  brought  about  by  Michael  Cserularins. He  was  busy  pacifying  Benevento,  a  city  belonging to  the  Holy  See,  when  he  was  taken  prisoner by  the  Normans  and  held  for  a  year  in  captivity. On  his  return  to  Rome,  broken  down  and enfeebled,  at  the  early  age  of  fifty-two,  he breathed  forth  his  holy  soul  before  the  High Altar  in  St.  Peter's,  April  19,  a.d.  1054.  He  has left  some  writings,  the  most  notable  of  which is  his  Apology  for  the  Latin  Church  against  the Greeks 
LEO  of  SENS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  22)  
(6th  cent.)  The  sixteenth  or  seventeenth Bishop  of  Sens  in  France  who  flourished  in  the first  half  of  the  sixth  century  and  occupied  that See  for  twenty-three  years,  defending  its  rights against  the  pretensions  of  King  Childebert,  and winning  the  love  and  veneration  of  his  people.

(6th  cent.)  A  monk  who  succeeded  St. Romanus  in  the  government  of  the  monastery which  the  latter  had  built,  under  King  Clovis, near  Troyes  (France).  On  account  of  his virtues  and  supernatural  gifts,  St.  Leo  was greatly  venerated  both  in  life  and  after  his holy  death  (the  day  and  hour  of  which  he  had predicted)  by  the  clergy  of  the  Diocese  of Troyes.  No  vestige  now  remains  of  his  monastery, except  a  Cross  erected  to  mark  its  site at  Mantenay-St.-Lie.

LEO  III  (St.)  Pope.  (June  12)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth,  who  succeeded Hadrian  I  in  the  Chair  of  St.  Peter  (a.d.  795). At  the  outset  of  his  Pontificate  he  had  to  contend with  the  unruly  factions  that  hindered  all  good government  in  the  Italy  of  that  age.  He  was himself  seized  and  put  to  the  torture.  He called  to  his  help  the  great  Emperor  Charlemagne, who  re-established  order  in  Rome,  and who  was  by  Pope  Leo  crowned  Emperor  of  the West  in  St.  Peter's  (A.D.  800).  St.  Leo  himself did  much  to  build  up  again  the  ruined  city  and more,  by  his  holy  and  energetic  life,  to  ensure the  peace  and  prosperity,  temporal  as  well  as spiritual,  of  its  inhabitants.  He  died  June 12,  A.D.  816.  

LEO  II  (St.)  Pope.  (June  28)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Sicilian,  eminent  for  piety, skilled  in  the  Latin  and  Greek  tongues,  and well  versed  in  the  science  and  literature  of  the age.  He  succeeded  Pope  St.  Agatho  in  St. Peter's  Chair  (a.d.  682).  He  blamed  Honorius, a  former  Pope,  for  his  negligence  in  not  at  once condemning  the  Monothelite  heresy,  though he  does  not  allow  that  Honorius  himself  had ever  fallen  into  that  error.  St.  Leo  reformed the  Gregorian  chant  and  composed  several Liturgical  Hymns.  He  died  a.d.  683,  and  was buried  in  St.  Peter's.  All  his  life  long  looked upon  as  the  "  Father  of  the  Poor,"  they  more than  all  others  grieved  over  his  loss  after  so brief  a  Pontificate.

He  repaired  the  Confession  or  Shrine  of  St. Peter,  and  with  the  help  of  the  Emperor Lothaire,  enclosed  the  whole  Vatican  Hill  with a  wall  (the  Leonine  City),  to  prevent  the incursions  of  the  marauding  bands  then  overrunning Italy.  Chiefly  by  his  prayers  and  by his  exhortations  to  the  soldiers,  the  Saracens from  Calabria  were  utterly  routed  at  Ostia. He  did  much  to  reform  Ecclesiastical  discipline, and  held  a  Council  in  Rome  with  that  object. He  received  King  Ethelwulph  of  England, who  came  a  pilgrim  to  Rome  with  his  son Alfred,  and  at  his  father's  recpiest  Leo  anointed Alfred  King.  St.  Leo  died  July  17,  A.D.  855, and  was  succeeded  bv  Benedict  III.

On  the  death  of  King Clovis  II  he  assisted  St.  Bathildis,  the  Queen Regent,  duriug  the  minority  of  her  son,  Clotaire III.  In  A.D.  659  he  became  Bishop  of  Autun, where  he  reformed  Church  discipline  and enjoined  in  all  monasteries  the  strict  observance of  the  Ilule  of  St.  Benedict.  He  was  for  some time  driven  from  his  See  through  jealousy,  and with  admirable  patience  endured  other  persecution. In  the  end,  through  the  machinations  of Ebroin,  the  odious  Mayor  of  the  Palace  to Theodoric  III,  St.  Leger  was  cruelly  done  to death  (A.D.  678).

He  was  eminent for  austerity  of  life  and  for  the  charitable  help he  never  refused  to  those  in  trouble,  more especially  to  poor  prisoners.  He  gradually gathered  disciples  around  him.  He  died  a happy  death  about  a.d.  559,  and  his  memory was  throughout  the  Middle  Ages  venerated everywhere  in  Western  Europe.

He  propagated  everywhere  devotion  to Our  Lord's  Passion,  and  in  particular  the  prayer of  the  Way  of  the  Cross.  A  holy  death  (Nov.  26, a.d.  1751)  crowned  his  life  of  utter  self-sacrifice.

( 6th  cent. )  The  Roman  Martyrology  indicates St.  Licerius  as  a  Bishop  of  Ilerda  in  Spain  ;  but, though  probably  born  in  that  town,  his  Episcopal city  appears  to  have  been  Conserans,  in the  South  of  France.  Possibly  even  he  is  one and  the  same  with  Glycerius,  second  Bishop  of Conserans.  He  flourished  in  the  sixth  century, and  governed  his  Church  for  about  forty  years. Many  miracles  are  attributed  to  him. LICINIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  7)  

See SS. CARPOPHORUS, EXANNTHUS, <fec *LIDWINA  (St.)  V.  (April  14)  
(15th  cent.)  A  holy  virgin,  born  at  Schiedham  in  Holland  (a.d.  1380),  who  until  her  death (A.D.  1433)  lived  a  life  of  heroic  patience  under unceasing  pain  caused  by  bodily  infirmities. Her  only  comfort  was  that  afforded  her  by  the supernatural  favours  with  which  it  pleased Almighty  God  to  enrich  her.  Her  shrine  is  at 33riiss6ls« LIE  (LYE)*  (St.)  (Nov.  10)  

Otherwise  St. LEO of  MELUN, which  see. St.  LEO  of  TROYES  (May  25)  is  also  known as  St.  LIE  or  LYE. *LIEBERT  (St.)  M.  (July  14)  
(9th  cent.) A  Saint  born  at  Malines  in  Belgium, who became an Abbot, and suffered martyrdom at the hands of the Normans (A.D.  835).
♦LIEPHARD  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  4)  
(7th  cent.)  A  legend  makes  him  out  to  have been  the  companion  of  King  Cadwalla  in  the latter's  pilgrimage  to  Rome.  He  was  no  doubt of  English  birth  and  may  have  been  a  Bishop, as  certain  local  Liturgies  describe  him.  He was  done  to  death  near  Cambrai  in  France about  a.d.  640,  while  on  his  way  back  to England.  Some  writers  have  confused  him with  St.  Liudhard,  the  Bishop  who  attended Queen  Bertha  to  Canterbury,  but  neither  dates nor  ascertained  facts  justify  this  theory. *LIETBERT  (LIEBERT)  (St.)  Bp.  (June  23)  
(11th cent.) An Archbishop of Cambrai, 
celebrated  for  the  austerity  of  his  life.  He 
underwent  much  persecution  before  his  holy 
death  (A.D.  1076).  

LIGORIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  13)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  hermit  in  the  East, who  having  been  discovered  by  a  mob  of  Pagans, was  slain  by  them.  His  remains  were  afterwards brought  to  Venice,  where  he  is  in  veneration as  a  Saint  and  a  Martyr. LILIOSA  (St.)  M.  (July  27)  

See  SS.  GEORGE,  FELIX,  &c. LINUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Sept.  23)  
(First  cent.)  The  immediate  successor  of St.  Peter  in  the  See  of  Rome,  as  St.  Irenseus and  others  of  the  early  Fathers  assure  us. Tertullian,  indeed,  holds  that  St.  Peter  appointed St.  Clement  to  take  his  place ;  but  it  is  now generally  admitted  that  the  order,  Linus, Clctus,  Clement,  is  the  true  one.  St.  Linus ruled  the  Church  for  twelve  years  (a.d.  6779),  and  is  numbered  among  the  Martyrs in  the  Canon  of  the  Roman  Mass.  Tradition adds  that  St.  Linus  lies  buried  near  the  grave of  the  Apostle  in  St.  Peter's.  He  is  said  to  have insisted  that  women  should  never  enter  a church  with  uncovered  heads.  He  is  almost certainly  the  Linus  mentioned  by  St.  Paul (2  Tim.  iv.  41). LIOBA  (St.)  V.  (April  23)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  lady  who  at the  invitation  of  St.  Boniface  passed  over, together  with  St.  Thecla  and  others,  into Germany,  to  aid  the  Saint  in  his  Apostolic labours.  St.  Lioba  was  made  Abbess  of  the monastery  then  just  founded  at  Bischoffsheim, and  quickly  won  the  respect  and  love  of  princes and  people.  She  died  about  A.D.  779,  and  was 

interred, like St. Boniface, at Fulda. Her biographer  assures  us  that  he  himself  was  an eye-witness  of  some  of  the  miracles  wrought at  her  tomb. LIPHARDUS  (St.)  (June  3)  
(6th  cent.)  A  citizen  of  Orleans  who,  having occupied  various  municipal  positions  of  distinction, at  the  age  of  fifty  embraced  the Ecclesiastical  state.  When  a  deacon  he  retired to  a  solitary  spot  near  the  city  and  gave  himself up  to  a  life  of  prajrer  and  penance.  Later, when  he  had  been  ordained  priest,  a  number  of disciples  gathered  round  him,  and  he  became founder  and  first  Abbot  of  a  celebrated  monastery. He  died  in  the  last  half  of  the  sixth century,  but  the  exact  year  is  not  known. LITTEUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.  10)

LIVINUS  (LEBWIN)  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  12)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who,  desirous  of 
winning  souls  to  God,  repaired  to  St.  Augustine 
of  Canterbury  and  was  by  him  ordained  priest 
and speeded on his way to Flanders, then 
sadly  in  need  of  missionaries.  St.  Livinus  paid 
a  farewell  visit  to  Ireland,  whence  he  returned 
already  consecrated  Bishop  and  accompanied 
by  several  other  holy  and  zealous men.  In 
Flanders  his  Apostolate  was  most  fruitful  and 
was  crowned  by  the  martyrdom  of  the  holy 
man  at  the  hands  of  the  Pagans  (a.d.  650  about).  

His  relics  were  enshrined  at  Ghent.

Otherwise  St.  LEOCADIA,  which  see. *LOLANUS  (St.)  (Sept.  2)  
(5th  cent.)  A  tradition  makes  him  a  native of  Cana  of  Galilee  and  a  nephew  of  St.  Serf. The  account  goes  on  to  say  that,  after  living seven  years  in  Rome,  he  came  to  Scotland  and there  finished  his  earthly  course.  But  the whole  legend  is  of  very  uncertain  authority. *LOMAN  (LUMAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  17)  
(5th  cent.) The  first  Bishop  of  Trim  in  Meath, said  to  have  been  a  nephew  of  St.  Patrick. *LOMER  (LAUDOMARUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  19) (6th cent.)

(1st  cent.)  It  is  an  accredited  tradition  that this  St.  Longinus  was  the  centurion  who pierced  the  side  of  Our  Lord  hanging  on  the Cross  (John  xix.  34) ;  and  that,  converted  to Christianity,  he  retired  into  Cappadocia,  his native  country,  where  he  was  put  to  death, a  Martyr  to  his  Faith  in  Christ.  His  body  is venerated  in  Rome  in  the  Church  of  St.  Augustine. LONGINUS  (St.)  M.  (April  24)

LOUIS  of  CORDOVA  (St.)  M.  (April  30)  

See  SS.  AMATOR,  PETER,  &c.  

LOUIS  of  TOULOUSE  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  19)  
(13th  cent.)  Born  in  Provence  (A.D.  1274), he  was  the  great  nephew  of  St.  Louis,  King  of France,  and  through  his  mother,  the  greatnephew  also  of  St.  Elisabeth  of  Hungary.  He was  inured  to  hardships  from  his  childhood, both  because  of  the  strictness  of  his  homelife, and  because  of  the  ill-treatment  he  had  received while  kept  prisoner  for  seven  years  at  Barcelona, as  hostage  for  his  father,  who  had  been  taken prisoner  of  war.  When  again  free  he  voluntarily embraced  a  life  of  austerity  and  prayer. He  made  his  Religious  Prof  ession  as  a  Franciscan Friar  in  Rome.  Reluctantly,  and  "  as  the poorest  of  the  poor,"  he  took  possession  of  the important  Archbishopric  of  Toulouse,  to  which he  was  almost  at  once  promoted.  He  did  not, however,  live  to  govern  his  Diocese,  but  passed away  at  Brignolles,  his  birthplace,  Aug.  19, A.D.  1297,  when  only  twenty-three  years  old. Such  was  his  repute  for  sanctity  that  he  was almost  at  once  canonised.  His  relics  are  at Valentia  in  Spain.  

LOUIS  IX  (St.)  King  of  France.  (Aug.  25)  
(13th  cent.)  The  Saint  of  whom  the  freethinkers, Gibbon  and  Voltaire,  say :  "  He united  the  virtues  of  a  King  to  those  of  a  Hero and  to  those  of  a  Man."  And  "  Never  has  it been  accorded  to  man  to  push  virtue  further." Born  near  Paris,  A.D.  1215,  he  succeeded  his father,  Louis  VIII,  under  the  Regency  of  his mother,  Blanche  of  Castile,  in  A.D.  1226.  He reigned  for  forty-four  years,  more  austere  and more  prayerful  than  a  Religious  in  his  private life,  an  energetic  ruler  but  considerate  of  his people,  and  above  all  "  hungering  and  thirsting after  justice  "  in  the  discharge  of  his  public duties.  He  married  Marguerite  of  Provence and,  through  their  son,  Philip,  the  Royal  House of  France  was  perpetuated.  The  Kings  of England  also  are  by  the  female  line  descendants of  St.  Louis.  St.  Louis  was  the  last  of  the Crusaders  and  led  two  expeditions  against  the Infidels,  in  the  second  of  which  he  died  of dysentery,  before  Tunis,  Aug.  25,  A.D.  1270. nis  relics  enshrined  at  Paris  were  destroyed in  the  Revolution  (A.D.  1793).  

LOUIS  BERTRAND  (St.)  (Oct.  9)  
(16th  cent.)  Born  at  Valencia  (a.d.  1526) and  a  blood  relation  of  St.  Vincent  Ferrer ; like  him,  he  took  the  habit  of  the  Order  of  St. Dominic.  Like  him  too,  he  was  animated  with the  spirit  of  an  Apostle  and  fired  with  the  zeal of  a  reformer.  His  life  was  spent  in  preaching in  Spain  and  in  South  America.  For  seven years  he  successfully  evangelised  the  Indians in  the  Spanish  Colonies  in  the  New  World. He  is  said  to  have  baptised  ten  thousand  of them  in  Panama  and  neighbouring  provinces. He  died  at  Valencia,  Oct.  9,  A.D.  1581.  

♦LOUISE  DE  MARILLAC  (Bl.)  Widow.  (March  15) (17th  cent.)  The  holy  widow  who,  zealously working  with  him,  enabled  St.  Vincent  de  Paul to  establish  the  celebrated  Institute  of  the Sisters  of  Charity.  After  her  husband's  death she  devoted  the  rest  of  her  life  to  the  service of  the  poor  and  of  the  sick.  She  passed  away at  Paris  (a.d.  1660)  and  was  beatified  by  Pope Benedict  XV  (1920).  

♦LOUIS  MARIE  GRIGNON  DE  MONTFORT 
(Bl.)  (Aug.  19)  
(18th  cent.) Born  in  Brittany  of  poor  parents 
(a.d.  1673)  he  from  childhood  devoted  himself 
to  the  service  of  God. Through  life  his  guiding 
motto  was : "  For  God  alone." Some  chari
168 

table  persons  having  defrayed  the  cost  of  his education,  he  was  ordained  priest  (A.D.  1700). He  then  forthwith  set  forth  on  his  career  as  an Apostolic  missionary  iu  France.  Prematurely worn  out  by  his  labours  as  a  travelling  preacher, and  by  the  austerity  of  his  life,  he  died  at La  Rochelle,  April  28,  a.d.  1716,  at  the  age of  forty-three.  To  carry  on  his  work  he  had founded  the  Institute  of  the  "  Daughters  of Wisdom,"  and  the  "  Society  of  Priests  of  the Holy  Ghost."  His  writings,  especially  his little  treatise  on  "  True  Devotion  to  Our Blessed  Lady,"  are  of  great  doctrinal  value. He  was  beatified  by  Pope  Leo  XIII  (a.d.  1886).

♦LUANUS  (LUGID,  MOLUA)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  4) (7th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Comgall  and (as  St.  Bernard  assures  us)  the  founder  of  one hundred  and  twenty  monasteries  in  Ireland  and Scotland.  His  Rule  was  one  of  the  most  austere of  its  kind.  Aug.  4,  a.d.  622,  is  given  as  the date  of  his  death.  His  Feast  is  kept  in  Scotland on  June  25.

LUCANUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  30)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Christian,  believed  to  have suffered  martyrdom  in  the  fifth  century  at Lagny  near  Paris,  and  at  one  time  much venerated  in  that  city,  where  his  relics  were enshrined.  No  particulars  concerning  this Saint  have  reached  our  time.  

LUCIAN  of  ANTIOCH  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  distinguished  for  his learning  and  eloquence ;  put  to  death  for  the Faith  at  Nicomedia  in  Asia  Minor  (a.d.  312) by  order  of  Maximinian  Galerius,  and  buried at  Helenopolis  in  Bithynia.  An  emendated Translation  of  the  Old  Testament  into  Greek is  due  to  him,  and  is  highly  praised  by  St. Jerome.  St.  Chrysostom  likewise  has  written at  length  in  praise  of  St.  Lucian.  

LUCIAN,  MAXIMIAN  and  JULIAN  (Jan.  8)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  uncertain.)  Saints  stated  to  have been  companions  of  St.  Denis  of  Paris,  and consequently  as  to  whose  date  there  is  much dispute,  whether  of  the  Apostolic  Age  or  of two  centuries  later.  They  were  the  Apostles of  the  country  round  Beauvais,  of  which  city some  say  that  St.  Lucian  was  the  first  Bishop. It  is  agreed  that  in  the  end  they  were  put  to death  as  Christians.  A  modern  view  holds that  there  were  two  Saints,  by  name  Lucian, at  Beauvais,  and  places  the  second  of  them as  late  as  the  time  of  Julian  the  Apostate,  in the  latter  half  of  the  fourth  century.

He  confessed the  Faith  under  Decius  (A.D.  250),  and was  racked  and  ultimately  burned  alive  with other  Believers.

LUCIDIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  26)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Bishop  of  Verona  in Italy  who  devoted  himself  in  a  very  special manner  to  study  and  prayer,  in  order  to  he  the better  fitted  to  instruct  his  flock.  His  relics are  enshrined  in  the  Basilica  of  St.  Stephen. The  date  of  his  Episcopate  is  controverted. LUCILLA, FLORA, EUGENE, ANTONY,

A  band  of  twenty-three  Christians, described  as  having  been  put  to  death for  their  Faith  under  the  Emperor  Gallienus (a.d.  259-268).  There  is,  however,  some  difficulty in  distinguishing  them  from  the  group of  Martyrs,  SS.  Lucy  and  twenty  others, venerated  on  June  25.  If  the  groups  are  really distinct  the  records  have  somehow  in  ancient times  got  mixed  up  together.  (See  also  St. LUCY,  July  6). LUCILLA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  31)  

See  SS.  NEMESIUS  and  LUCILLA. LUCILLIAN,  CLAUDIUS,  HYPATIUS,  PAUL 
and  DIONYSIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  in  the  ninth  persecution, that  of  Aurelian  (a.d.  273).  St.  Lucillian,  an old  man,  was  put  to  the  torture ;  and  then, with  the  four  boys,  Claudius,  Hypatius,  Paul and  Dionysius,  tied  to  the  stake  to  be  burned  ; but  rain  having  extinguished  the  fire  lighted round  them,  Lucillian  was  crucified  and  the others  beheaded.  They  suffered  at  Constantinople ;  but  probably  came  from  Nicomedia, where  Lucillian  before  his  conversion  had  been a  pagan  priest. LUCINA  (St.)  Matron.  (June  30)  
(First  cent.)  According  to  modern  writers, there  were  three  Saints  of  this  name.  All three  were  Roman  ladies  who  devoted  themselves to  the  ministering  to  the  Saints  in  prison and  to  the  burying  of  their  bodies  after  martyrdom. The  first  and  most  celebrated  of  the three,  who  is  especially  honoured  on  June  30, rendered  these  good  offices  to  SS.  Processuus and  Martinianus  and  other  Martyrs  of  Apostolic times.  The  second  ministered  similarly  during the  Decian  persecution  (a.d.  250).  The  third, in  the  time  of  Diocletian,  fifty  years  later, rescued  and  interred  the  bodies  of  St.  Sebastian and  of  other  victims  of  the  persecuting  Emperor's implacable  hatred  of  Christianity. LUCINIUS  (LEZIN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  13)  
(6th  cent.)  A  nobleman  of  the  Court  of Clotaire,  King  of  Soissons,  in  France.  He became  a  cleric  and  was  made  Bishop  of  Angers, which  See  he  illustrated  by  his  zeal  and  by  the sanctity  of  his  life  during  a  long  Episcopate. He  passed  away  in  some  year  of  the  reign  of Clotaire  II  (probably  about  a.d.  618).  Pope St.  Vitalian  is  said  to  have  canonised  St.  Lezin. LUCIOLUS  (St.)  M.  (March  3)

(4th  cent)  Catholic  Christians  of  Adrianople, persecuted  by  the  Arians,  and  eventually through  their  machinations  put  to  death. Their  leader,  St.  Lucius,  Bishop  of  Adrianople, is  well  known  on  account  of  his  zeal  at  the Council  of  Sardica  (a.d.  343)  and  elsewhere  in defence  of  Orthodoxy.  Pope  Julius  did  all that  could  be  done  to  protect  him,  and  gained the  consent  of  the  Arian  Emperor  Constantius to  his  return  to  Adrianople.  The  date  of  the martyrdom  of  these  holy  men  is  disputed.  It may  with  all  probability  be  assigned  to  a.d.  348. LUCIUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  15)

(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  Little  or  nothing  is  known of  these  Saints,  and  even  their  names  are uncertain.  Lucius  is  sometimes  found  written Lucas  or  Luke,  Lorgius  becomes  Largus, and  Absalom,  Absolucius.  St.  Lucius  is  said to  have  been  a  Spaniard  and  a  Bishop.  It  is agreed  that  all  three  suffered  in  Cappadocia (Asia  Minor),  and  it  seems  probable  that  they lived  in  the  first  century  of  the  Christian  era. LUCIUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (March  4)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  twenty-second  successor  of St.  Peter,  by  birth  a  Roman  or  perhaps  a Tuscan.  In  his  short  Pontificate  (A.D.  252254)  he  distinguished  himself  by  his  resistance to  the  Novatian  rigorists.  St.  Cyprian  extols  his virtue  and  his  zeal  for  souls.  He  was  banished for  a  time  from  Rome,  and  after  his  return was  seized  and  put  to  death  in  the  persecution under  Valerian.

(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  "  prophets  and doctors  "  recorded  in  Holy  Scripture  as  being in  the  Church  at  Antioch  when  Paul  and Barnabas  were  set  apart  for  their  Apostolic work  (Acts  xiii.  1).  He  is  stated  to  have  been "of  Cyrene,"  whence  the  tradition  that  he  was  the first  Bishop  of  that  city  in  the  Ptolemais  (Africa). LUCIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  23)  

See  SS.  QUINCTIANUS,  LUCIUS,  &c. LUCIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Senator  or  Dignitary  of  Cyrene in  Africa,  converted  to  Christianity  on  witnessing the  constancy  of  the  Martyr-Bishop  St. Theodore.  He  himself  drew  to  the  Faith, Dignianus,  the  Governor  or  magistrate,  and  in company  with  him  retired  to  the  Island  of Cyprus,  where,  with  many  other  Christians, they  were  put  to  death  in  the  persecution  under Diocletian  (A.D.  311).

(Date  unknown.) Roman  Martyrs  registered in  the  Martyrologies,  but  of  whom  there  now remains  no  other  record. LUCIUS  (St.)  King.  (Dec.  3)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  British  King  or  chieftain in  South  Wales  who  begged  from  Pope  St. Eleutherius  (a.d.  180  about)  Christian  missionaries, and  to  whom  in  response  were  sent SS.  Fugatius  and  Duvian  or  Damian.  That the  tradition  has  a  solid  foundation  seems indubitable,  and  it  is  the  only  explanation offered  of  the  fact  of  the  existence  in  Roman times  of  an  organised  British  Church.  The Roman  Martyrology  and  local  belief  identities St.  Lucius  of  Britain,  alleged  to  have  resigned Ids  chieftaincy  and  to  have  himself  become  a Christian  missionary,  with  St.  Lucius,  first Bishop  and  Martyr  at  Chiir,  in  the  Grisons (Switzerland).

LUCY 
LUCY  (LUCEIAS)  and  TWENTY  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (June  25)  
(3rd  cent.)  They  are  said  to  have  been prisoners  taken  in  war  and  sent  to  Rome  by the  Emperor  Probus  (a.d.  260).  In  Rome they  were  put  to  death  as  Christians.  The Acts  of  St.  Lucy  (which  the  Bollandists  deem not  untrustworthy)  have  it  that,  though  a virgin  consecrated  to  God,  a  captive  chief,  by name  Aucejas,  sought  her  in  marriage,  and  that in  the  end  she  was  martyred.  There  is,  however, much  difficulty  in  identifying  the  Saints and  in  reconciling  dates  in  their  legends.  See SS.  LUCILLA,  Ac.  (July  29) ;  also  SS.  FAUSTUS,  &c.  (June  24),  and  St.  LUCY  (July  6). LUCY, ANTONINUS, SEVERINUS, DIODORUS, 
DION  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  6)  
(Date  uncertain.)  In  the  opinion  of  the learned  Bollandists,  these  Saints  are  no  other than  the  "  St.  Lucy  and  Twenty-two  Martyrs  " commemorated  on  June  25.  The  St.  Lucy of  July  6  is  said  to  have  been  a  native  of Campania,  and  to  have,  with  her  companions, suffered  in  Rome.  There  is  a  legend  that  she converted  to  Christianity  the  notorious  Rictius Varus,  the  savage  Prefect  who  condemned  to torture  and  death  so  many  hundreds  of  the Faithful. LUCY  and  GEMINIANUS  (SS.)  MM. (Sept.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Lucy,  a  Christian  widow, seventy-five  years  old,  was  betrayed  in  Rome to  the  persecutors  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  300 about),  tortured  and  put  to  death  together with  a  neophyte,  Geminianus,  baptised  in  her prison.  But  the  Acts  now  extant  of  these Saints  are  untrustworthy  as  to  details. LUCY  (St.)  V.M.  (Dec.  13)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Sicilian  maiden,  one  of  the most  famous  of  the  sufferers  (a.d.  304)  in  the great  persecution  under  Diocletian,  and  still commemorated  daily  in  the  Canon  of  the  Mass. While  the  Christians  were  being  sought  out, she  distributed  her  wealth  to  the  poor,  and was  thereupon  denounced  by  a  young  noble, to  whom  her  mother  wished  to  give  her  in marriage.  She  bravely  endured  shameful tortures  and  indignities,  culminating  in  the driving  of  a  sword  through  her  throat.  Her last  words  were  a  prophecy  of  the  coming  peace of  the  Church.  Her  relics  are  venerated  at Metz  and  at  Venice. LUDGER  (St.)  Bp.  (March  26)  
(9th  cent.)  The  Apostle  of  Saxony  and first  Bishop  of  Munster.  He  was  ..a  Frisian  by birth  and  educated  by  St.  Gregory  of  Utrecht, but  afterwards  a  pupil  of  Alcuin  at  York. Returning  to  his  fatherland  as  a  missionary, he  successfully  evangelised  a  great  part  of Central  Germany,  notably  Westphalia,  where he  founded  the  Bishopric  of  Munster.  The holiness  of  his  life  and  his  zeal  for  souls  won him  the  respect  and  affection  of  Pope  St.  Hadrian I  and  of  the  Emperor  Charlemagne.  He  died at  the  age  of  sixty-six,  March  26,  A.d.  809. A  Life  of  St.  Gregory  of  Utrecht  is  from  his  pen.
♦LUDMILLA  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  16)  
(10th  cent.)  A  Sclavonian  Princess,  Duchess of  Bohemia.  She  was  converted  to  Christianity by  St.  Methodius  and  was  a  matron  of  most saintly  life.  She  was  universally  beloved  on account  of  her  charity  and  goodness  to  all with  whom  she  had  to  deal.  She  deserved  well of  the  Bohemian  nation  on  account  of  the care  with  which  she  watched  over  the  education of  their  future  Prince,  St.  Wenceslas.  St. Ludmilla  eventually  fell  a  victim  to  the  jealousy of  her  daughter-in-law,  by  whose  orders  she  was strangled  by  hired  assassins,  about  a.d.  925. LUDOVICA  (St.)  Widow.  (.Ian.  31)  
(16th  cent.)  Blessed  Ludovica  Albertoni, a  Roman  Matron  of  noble  birth,  on  the  death of  her  husband,  sold  all  her  property  and distributed  the  proceeds  to  the  poor.  Thenceforth she  lived  a  saintly  and  useful  life  as  a Tertiary  of  the  Order  of  St.  Francis. She  died 
170 

at  the  age  of  sixty-three,  A.D.  1533,  and  her tomb  in  the  church  of  St.  Francis  in  Rome was  the  scene  of  many  miracles.  Her  cultus was  sanctioned  by  Pope  Clement  X,  a.d.  1671. *LUICAN  (St.)  (July  27)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Title  Saint  of  KillLuican, seemingly a place in County Roscommon. LUKE  (LUCAS)  (St.)  M.  (April  12)

♦LUKE  KIRBY  (Bl.)  M.  (May  30)  
(16th  cent.) Born  in  the  North  of  England, 
he  studied  at  Douai  and  in  Rome.  On  his 
return  to  England  as  a  priest  he  was  subjected 
in  the  Tower  to  the  horrible  torture  known  as 
the  "  Scavenger's  daughter."  He  was  put  to 
death  at  Tvburn,  A.D.  1582.  

LUKE  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  10)  

See  SS.  APOLLIUS,  LUKE,  &c. LUKE  (St.)  Evangelist.  (Oct.  18)  
(1st  cent.)  A  physician  of  Antioch  in  Syria, who,  converted  to  Christianity,  became  the! fellow-worker  of  St.  Paul.  He  is  the  inspired writer  of  the  Third  Gospel  and  also  of  the  Acts of  the  Apostles.  It  is  from  his  pen  that  we learn  the  greater  part  of  what  ha3  been  revealed to  us  concerning  the  Incarnation,  Birth  and Early  Life  of  Our  Lord.  St.  Luke's  preaching after  the  death  of  St.  Paul  seems  to  have  been chiefly  in  the  South-East  of  Europe.  He  is venerated  as  a  Martyr  and  as  having  suffered in  Greece.  A  persistent  tradition  holds  that he  was  a  skilled  artist,  and  various  pictures  of Our  Blessed  Lady,  venerated  in  Rome  and elsewhere,  are  attributed  to  his  brush. LULLUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  16)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Englishman,  kinsman  of St.  Boniface,  and  his  successor  in  the  See  of Mentz  or  Mayence.  In  his  youth  he  had  been a  pupil  of  Venerable  Bede  at  Jarrow.  For thirty-four  years  he  governed  firmly  and  wisely the  newly-founded  Church  of  Germany,  and to  end  his  days  retired  to  the  monastery  he  had founded  at  Hertzfeld.  He  passed  away  Nov.  1, a.d.  787. *LUNAIRE  (St.)  Bp.  (July  1)

(8th  cent.) A  Bishop  of  Verona  (Italy)  who flourished at  the  end  of  the  eighth  century, but  the  details  of  whose  career  have  been  lost. LUPICINUS  and  FELIX  (SS.)  Bps.  (Feb.  3)  
(5th  cent.)  Set  down  in  the  Martyrologics as  Bishops  of  Lyons.  To  St.  Lupicinus  is usually  assigned  the  date  a.d.  486.  St.  Felix, who  is  presented  as  his  contemporary,  was most  likely  Bishop  of  some  other  See  who died  at  Lyons  at  about  the  same  time  as  St. Lupicinus,  but  nothing  certain  is  known about  either  the  one  or  the  other  of  these Saints. LUPICINUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  21)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Saint  whose  sanctity  and miracles  are  dwelt  upon  by  St.  Gregory of  Tours.  He  was  Abbot  of  the  monastery  of St.  Claud  in  the  Jura,  and  later  of  that  of Lauconne,  founded  by  his  brother,  St.  Romanus. He  flourished  about  a.d.  480. LUPICINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  31)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Verona,  some  time between  the  fourth  and  seventh  centuries. Ancient  writings  preserved  at  Verona  say  of him  that  he  was  "  most  holy,  the  best  of Bishops  "  ;  and  that  the  grief  of  his  people at  his  death  was  "  so  great  as  to  be  unbelievable." LUPPUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  23)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Christian  slave  who was  put  to  death  for  the  Faith,  but  at  what date  and  in  what  place  is  unknown.  Greeks and  Latins  have  him  equally  in  honour. 
MACARIUS 

LUPUS  of  TROYES  (St.)  Bp.  (July  29)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  distinguished Bishops  of  the  fifth  century.  Born  at  Toul and  married  to  the  sister  of  St.  Hilary,  after seven  years,  husband  and  wife  separated  by mutual  consent ;  and  Lupus  became  a  monk in  the  Isle  of  Lerins  in  the  Mediterranean. In  a.d.  426  he  was  made  Bishop  of  Troyes, but  continued  his  monastic  manner  of  life. In  the  course  of  his  energetic  Episcopate,  he accompanied  St.  Germanus  to  Britain  to  rid the  country  of  Pelagianism;  and  in  a.d.  453 succeeded  in  saving  Troyes  from  being  sacked by  Attila  and  his  Huns.  St.  Lupus  died  July 29,  a.d.  479,  at  the  age  of  ninety-six.  

LUPUS  (LEU)  of  SENS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  1)  
(7th  cent.)  The  nineteenth  Bishop  of  Sens (France),  in  witness  to  whose  eminent  sanctity, on  one  occasion,  while  he  was  offering  up  the Holy  Sacrifice,  a  precious  stone  fell  from Heaven  into  his  chalice.  He  distinguished himself  by  his  tact  and  firmness  in  dealing with  the  rival  Merovingian  Princes  of  his time.  

LUPUS  of  LYONS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  25)  
(6th  cent.)  A  monk  of  a  monastery  near Lyons,  who  became  Archbishop  of  that  See, and  as  such  (a.d.  523)  presided  over  one  of  the Councils  of  Orleans.  He  had  much  to  suffer in  the  political  troubles  which  ensued  in  the year  of  that  Council  on  the  death  of  St.  Sigismund,  King  of  Burgundy.  St.  Lupus  closed by  a  holy  death  (a.d.  542)  a  long  and  useful Episcopate.  

LUPUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  14)  

See  SS.  SATURNINUS  and  LUPUS.  

LUPUS  of  VERONA  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  2)  
(6th  cent.) A  holy  Bishop  of  Verona  who 
flourished  in  the  sixth  century,  but  of  whom, 
as  of  most  of  the  early  occupants  of  that  See, 
all  particidars  have  been  lost.  

♦LUPERCULUS  (LUPERCUS)  (St.) (March  1) Bp.,  M.  

(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  victims  of  the  persecution under  Diocletian,  or  perhaps  of  that  half a  century  earlier  under  Decius ;  but  whether in  France  or  in  Spain  it  is  now  impossible  to say.  He  is  chiefly  venerated  at  Tarbes,  near Lourdes.  

LUTGARDE  (St.)  V.  (June  16)  
(13th  cent.)  Born  at  Tongres  (Brabant) a.d.  1182,  and  professed  as  a  nun  at  the  age  of twenty.  After  some  years  the  Sisters  insisted on  her  being  made  Prioress,  whereupon  she retired  to  a  little  convent  at  Aywieres.  Here, for  thirty  years,  through  her  prayers,  miracle followed  upon  miracle — the  most  wonderful of  all  being  the  holiness  of  her  own  life.  She died  a.d.  1246,  and  her  name  was  inserted in  the  Roman  Martyrologv.  

LUXORIUS,  CISELLUS  and  CAMERINUS  Uug.21) (SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Sardinian  Martyrs  who  suffered in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  303A.D.  313).

(1st  cent.)  A  native  of  Thyatira  (now Ak-Hissar),  a  city  in  Asia  Minor,  famous  for its  dye-works,  whence  Lydia's  trade  (Purpuraria,  PurpleSeller).  She  was  at  Philippi in  Macedonia  when  her  heart  was  opened  and she  became  St.  Paul's  first  convert  in  Europe and  afterwards  his  hostess  (Acts  xvi.  14,  15). There  are  no  trustworthy  traditions  concerning ber  after-life. 

LYE  (St.)  (Nov.  10)  
Both  St. LEO  of  TROYES (May 25) and St.  LEO  of  MELTJN  (Nov.  10)  are  frequently called  St.  LYE  or  St.  LIE.

♦MABYN  (St.)  (Sept.  21)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Saints,  Mabyn,  Mabon, Mabenna,  in  Wales  and  Cornwall,  are  associated with  St.  Teilo,  and  have  originated  some  placenames.  But  nothing  definite  can  be  stated  in regard  to  them.  One  of  the  daughters  of  the chieftain,  Brychan  of  Brecknock,  is  venerated as  St.  Mabenna ;  and  the  place-name,  Ruabon (Denbigh)  perpetuates  the  name  of  another Saint  of  similar  name. *MACAILLE  (St.)  Bp.  (April  25)  
(5th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Mel  who  became Bishop  of  Croghan  (King's  County).  He assisted  St.  Mel  in  receiving  St.  Bridgid's  vows, and  counselled  her  to  strive  to  excel  in  the virtue  of  mercy.  St.  Macaille  died  about  a.d. 489.  He  seems  to  be  other  than  his  contemporary, St.  Maccai,  also  a  disciple  of  St.  Patrick, venerated  in  the  Isle  of  Bute.
♦MACANISIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  3)  
(6th cent.) Baptised  as  an  infant  by St.  

Patrick,  he  became  first  Bishop  of  Connor  and

♦MACARTIN  (MACCARTHEN)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  24)  
(6th  cent.)  An  early  disciple  and  faithful companion  of  St.  Patrick,  who  consecrated  him first  Bishop  of  Clogher  and  is  said  to  have  given him  his  own  pastoral  staff.  St.  Macartin  was remarkable  for  his  tender  devotion  to  Our Blessed  Lady.  He  died  March  24,  a.d.  506. MACARIA  (St.)  M.  (April  8)  

See  SS.  JANUARIUS,  MAXIMA, &c.  

One  of  six  Martyrs  who  suffered  as  Christians in  Africa.  In  some  Martyrologies  the  masculine termination  occurs  ;  and  so  with  her  companion St.  Maxima.  Januarius  is  only  registered  with these  Saints  in  the  Roman  Martyrologies,  but three  other  Saints  are  frequently  mentioned in  other  Martyrologies.  No  particulars  and  no dates  are  known. MACARIUS  THE  YOUNGER  (St.)  (Jan.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  Sometimes  styled  "  the  Younger," sometimes  "of  Alexandria,"  to  distinguish  him from  another  St.  Macarius  who  was  also  a  hermit in  Egypt.  He  is  said  to  have  abandoned  the trade  of  a  fruiterer  to  consecrate  himself  to  God in  the  Thebaid  in  Upper  Egypt,  about  A.D.  335. Thence  passing  into  Lower  Egypt,  he  took  up his  abode  in  the  Desert  of  Nitria.  Here  he  was ordained  priest  and  surpassed  the  other  hermits in  the  practice  of  austerities.  He  became renowned  for  his  gifts  of  prophecy  and  miracleworking.  Lucius,  the  intruded  Arian  Patriarch of  Alexandria  banished  him  on  account  of  his unflinching  Orthodoxy.  He  died,  according  to Palladius,  about  a.d.  395,  at  an  advanced  age. He  is  alleged  to  have  written  a  Rule  for  Monks and  some  Discourses  on  spiritual  subjects. MACARIUS  THE  ELDER  (St.)  (Jan.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Saint,  born  about A.D.  300,  who  in  his  youth  retired  to  a  solitary hut,  where  he  combined  assiduous  prayer  and the  practice  of  austerities  with  the  tending  of sheep  and  the  plaiting  of  baskets.  Soon,  to escape  public  notice,  he  fled  to  the  Desert  of Scete,  where  he  was  promoted  to  the  priesthood and  passed  the  remaining  sixty  years  of  his  life. His  chief  duty  was  to  celebrate  daily  the  Divine Mysteries  and  otherwise  minister  to  the  spiritual needs  of  the  several  thousand  members  of  this

MACARIUS 
monastic  colony.  His  gift  of  working  miracles extended  to  the  raising  of  the  dead  to  life ; and  his  attachment  to  the  Orthodox  Faith  led to  the  dispersion,  exile,  and  martyrdom  of  his monks.  St.  Macarins  and  other  survivors  were recalled  from  banishment  by  the  Emperor Valens,  who  feared  a  popular  uprising  on  their account.  St.  Macarius  died  A.D.  390.  

MACARIUS,  JUSTUS,  and  THEOPHILUS  (Feb.  28) (SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  According  to  the  Roman  Martyrology,  they  suffered  in  Rome  during  the  Decian persecution  (a.d.  250).  Some  other  Martyrologies  describe  them  as  having  been  potters  by trade,  and  allege  their  place  of  suffering  to  have been  Alexandria.  Their  relics  are  venerated  in the  Jesuit  Church  at  Bari.  Bologna  also  claims to  possess  some  part  of  them.  

MACARIUS  of  JERUSALEM  (St.)  Bp.  (March  10) (4th  cent.)  The  thirty-ninth  Patriarch  of Jerusalem  and  a  strenuous  defender  of  the Orthodox  Faith  against  the  Arians.  He  was the  first  of  the  Bishops  of  Palestine  to  subscribe the  Canons  of  the  Council  of  Nicaoa  (A.D.  325). During  his  Episcopate  the  Empress  St.  Helena recovered  the  True  Cross,  and  it  was  he  who planned  Constantine's  magnificent  Basilica  of the  Holy  Sepulchre.  He  died  about  a.d.  353.  

MACARIUS  of  CONSTANTINOPLE  (St.)  (April  1) (9th  cent.)  The  Abbot  of  a  great  monastery near  Constantinople,  renowned  for  learning  and virtue,  and  favoured  by  Almighty  God  with  the gift  of  healing.  His  zeal  for  the  Catholic  Faith was  so  ardent  that  the  Iconoclast  Emperor  Leo the  Armenian  singled  him  out  as  the  special object  of  his  fury.  He  was  put  to  the  torture and  detained  in  prison  until  the  death  of  the tyrant.  Michael  the  Stammerer,  successor  of the  latter,  banished  him  to  a  neighbouring island,  where  he  died  about  A.D.  830.  

MACARIUS  of  ANTIOCH  (St.)  (April  10)  
(11th  cent.)  An  Armenian,  who  in  his  youth wa^>  placed  under  the  care  of  his  relative Macarius,  Archbishop  of  Antioch,  whom  he succeeded  in  his  Patriarchal  dignity.  Fearing the  loss  of  the  grace  of  humility  through  the honours  paid  him,  he  resigned  his  charge, distributed  his  goods  among  the  poor  and journeyed  into  Palestine,  where  his  zeal  for souls  exposed  him  to  many  dangers,  which, however,  he  passed  through  unharmed.  He next  set  out  on  a  missionary  journey  to  the West,  where  his  labours  in  Bavaria  and  at Cologne,  Mayence,  Malines,  Cambrai,  Tournai and  elsewhere  were  confirmed  by  miracles,  and resulted  in  a  marvellous  harvest  of  souls.  He died  at  Ghent  (A.D.  1012) — a  last  victim  of  the Plague,  then  raging  in  those  parts.  His  shrine is  in  one  of  the  churches  of  that  city.  

MACARIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  20)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Petra  in  Palestine, associated  with  St.  Asterius,  Bishop  of  the  other Petra  in  Arabia.  He  was  a  resolute  defender of  the  Catholic  doctrine  of  the  Holy  Trinity and  took  part  in  the  Council  of  Sardica.  He suffered  much  at  the  hands  of  the  Arians,  who succeeded  in  banishing  him  to  Africa  (a.d.  350 about),  where  he  died.  His  real  name  (as appears  from  the  works  of  St.  Athanasius)  was Arius ;  but  he  changed  it  to  Macarius,  on account  of  its  being  that  of  the  heresiarch, against  whom  his  life  was  a  continuous  struggle.  

MACARIUS  and  JULIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  12)  
(Date  unknown).  Described as Martyrs in 
Syria. Their  names  are  found  in  most  of  the 
ancient  Registers ;  but no date is given, 
nor  have  we  any  details  of  their  martyrdom.  

MACARIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  5)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  soldier  who  was  put  to death  at  Melitene  in  Armenia  on  the  River Euphrates,  with  his  comrades  Eudoxius  and Zeno,  and  seven  hundred  and  four  other  soldiers, on  account  of  their  religion.  Some  say  that these  Christians  were  among  the  victims  of  the persecution  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  302,  about) ; 172 

others  join  them  with  St.  Romulus,  a  Martyr of  Trajan's  time,  nearly  two  centuries  earlier. A  detailed  account  of  the  sufferings  of  these Martyrs  exists,  but  it  is  of  late  date  and  early accounts  are  lacking. MACARIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  6)  

See  SS.  FAUSTUS,  MACARIUS, &c. MACARIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM. (Oct.  30) (3rd  cent.)  On  Oct.  30  the  Roman  Martryology  notes  a  special  festival,  kept  in  honour of  the  thirteen  Martyrs  who  suffered  (it  would seem) at Alexandria, together with a St. Macarius,  under  the  Emperor  Decius  (A.D.  250). Tradition has preserved  the  names of  three among  them,  Eunus,  Julian  and  Justus. See  St.  MACARIUS  (Feb.  28  and  Dec.  8). MACARIUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  8)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  burned  alive  for his  religion  (it  is  said)  at  Alexandria  in  Egypt during  the  Decian  persecution.  By  many  he is  supposed  to  be  identical  with  the  St.  Macarius of  Feb.  28,  alleged  to  have  suffered  with  others in  Rome,  but  whose  death  most  ancient  Registers place  elsewhere,  some  at  Thessalonica. MACARIUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  20)  

See  SS.  EUGENE  and  MACARIUS. *MACCALDUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  28)

(6th  cent.)  A  Saint  whose  chief  monastery was  in  Clonmore,  where  he  worked  many miracles.  He  was  closely  allied  with  SS. Onchu  and  Finan,  and  co-operated  with  them in  promoting  peaceful  relations  among  the Irish  chieftains  of  his  time. MACEDON  (St.)  M.  (March  27)  

See  SS.  PHILETUS,  LYDIA, &c. MACEDONIUS  (St.)  (Jan.  24)  
(5th  cent.) A  hermit  in  Syria  of  most  austere life,  renowned  in  the  East  for  the  many  miracles wrought  through  his  intercession. MACEDONIUS, PATRITIA and MODESTA 
(SS.)  MM.  (March  13)  
(4th  cent.)  The  names  of  these  and  those of  several  fellow-sufferers  with  them  appear in  most  of  the  ancient  Martyrologies.  They  are registered  as  having  been  put  to  death  at Nicomedia,  Diocletian's  Imperial  residence  on the  Sea  of  Marmora,  about  A.D.  304. MACEDONIUS, THEODULUS and  TATIAN 
(SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  12)  
(4th  cent.)  Phrygian  Christians  who,  irritated at  the  re-establishment  of  heathenism under  Julian  the  Apostate,  broke  into  a  temple and  destroyed  an  idol.  For  this,  on  their  refusal to  apostatise,  they  were  roasted  alive  (a.d. 362). MACHAREES  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  1> 
(2nd  cent.  B.C.)  These  Saints  of  the  Old Testament  are,  by  exception,  specially  and liturgically  venerated  in  the  Western  Church^ Prominent  among  them  were  the  old  man Eleazar,  a  chief  of  the  scribes,  ninety  years  of age,  and  a  mother  with  her  seven  sons  (2  Mach. vi.  vii.).  Several  Fathers  of  the  Church  have left  us  Panegyrics  preached  in  their  praise. Their  relics  were  by  the  Empress  St.  Helena brought  to  Constantinople,  but  afterwardstranslated  to  Rome.

♦MACHABEO  (GILDA-MACHAI-BEO)  (March  31)  
(St.)  Abbot.  

(12th  cent.)  Born  A.D.  1104,  St.  Machabeo entered  the  monastery  of  SS.  Peter  and  Paul at  Armagh,  of  which  he  became  Abbot,  and where  he  died  in  high  repute  of  holiness,  March 31,  A.D.  1174.
♦MACHAI  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  11)  
(5th  cent.) A  disciple  of  St.  Patrick  who founded  a  monastery  in  the  Isle  of  Bute. *MACHAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  28)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Scottish  Saint,  trained in  Ireland  and  consecrated  Bishop  in  Rome. The  Aberdeen  Breviary  gives  various  traditional particulars  of  his  miracles  ;  but  nothing  is  now reallv  known  about  him. *MACHARIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  13)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  baptised  by  St. Colman,  who  became  a  disciple  of  St.  Columba at  Iona,  and  who  was  sent  as  Bishop  with twelve  disciples  to  convert  the  Picts.  Tradition tells  us  of  a  memorable  pilgrimage  of  his  to  the shrine  of  St.  Martin  at  Tours. *MACHUDD  (MECHELL)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  15)  
(7th  cent.) The  sainted  Founder  of  Llanfechell  (Anglesey),  at  one  period  a  monastery of  great  importance. MACHUTUS  (MACLOVIUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  15)  

Otherwise  St.  MALO,  which  see. *MACKESSOG  (KECSAG)  (St.)  (March  10)  

Otherwise  St.  KESSOG,  which  see. MACRA  (St.)  V.M.  (Jan.  6)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  young  Christian  maiden  of Reims  in  France.  At  the  outbreak,  or  rather some  years  before  the  outbreak  of  the  persecution under  Diocletian,  she  was  arrested  as  a Christian  (A.D.  287)  and  brought  before  the infamous  Rictiovarus,  the  Imperial  representative at  Fismes  in  Champagne.  She  was  constant in  her  confession  of  Christ.  She  is described  as  having  been  subjected  to  the most  fiendish  tortures  before  being  burned  to death.  Like  St.  Agatha  of  Sicily,  in  art  she is  usually  represented  with  a  pair  of  pincers in  her  hand,  in  memory  of  one  of  the  happenings in  her  torture  chamber. MACRINA  THE  ELDER  (St.)  (Jan.  14)  
(4th  cent.)  This  holy  woman  was  the  paternal grandmother  of  SS.  Basil  and  Gregory  Nyssen. According  to  St.  Basil,  she  was  a  Christian, eminent  for  her  piety,  who  had  stored  up  in her  memory  the  teachings  of  St.  Gregory Thaumaturgus,  the  famous  Apostle  of  her native  city,  Neo-Csesarea  in  Pontus.  During the  persecutions  under  Diocletian  and  his colleague  Galerius,  she  with  her  husband  had been  forced  to  take  refuge  in  the  forests  of  the province,  and  had  remained  concealed  in  a hiding-place  on  the  shores  of  the  Black  Sea for  seven  years  or  more.  In  A.D.  311,  they were  able  to  return  to  Neo-Caesarea ;  but  at the  renewal  of  the  persecution  under  Licinius, they  suffered  so  much  that  St.  Gregory  Nyssen, their  grandson,  was  able  to  proclaim  them "  true  Martyrs  and  Confessors  of  Christ." St.  Basil,  also  her  grandson,  was  in  his  boyhood committed  to  the  care  of  St.  Macrina,  who  may be  said,  humanly  speaking,  to  have  laid  the foundations  of  the  sanctity  of  this  celebrated Doctor  of  the  Church.  St.  Macrina  passed  away about  the  middle  of  the  fourth  century. MACRINA  THE  YOUNGER  (St.)  V. (July  19)  
(4th  cent.)  The  sister  of  SS.  Basil,  Gregory Nyssen  and  Peter  of  Sebaste.  At  an  early  age she  was  betrothed  to  a  rich  and  noble  youth, but  his  sudden  death  determined  her  to  renounce all  worldly  prospects  and  to  consecrate  herself wholly  to  the  service  of  God.  She  helped  in the  training  of  her  brothers,  and  later  on  was instrumental  in  the  foundation  of  several Religious  Houses,  over  one  of  which  she  ultimately presided  as  Abbess.  She  had  for  many years  the  consolation  of  the  presence  of  her brother,  St.  Gregory  Nyssen,  with  whom  she spent  her  last  hours  in  prayer  and  heavenly 

conversation.  She  died  in  December,  A.D.  379, and  was  buried  in  the  grave  of  her  mother, St.  Eumelia,  in  the  Church  of  the  Forty  Martyrs at  Caesarea.  St.  Gregory  Nyssen  has  left  us  a magnificent  Funeral  Discourse  delivered  at  the obsequies  of  his  holy  sister.  From  some allusions  in  it  the  learned  Bollandists  are  inclined to  post-date  the  death  of  St.  Macrina  to  July, A.D.  380. MACRINA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  20)

See  SS.  SABINUS,  JULIAN, &c. MACROBIUS  and  JULIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  13) (4th cent.)  Two Christians who suffered under  the  Emperor  Licinius  (a.d.  321) ; but  in different  places.  St,  Macrobius,  a  Cappadocian, was  (say  the  Greeks),  on  account  of  his  intellectual abilities,  strong  character  and  physical beauty,  a  favourite  of  the  Emperor.  Disgraced on  account  of  his  religion,  he  was  banished with  other  Christians  into  Scythia,  and  finally burned  at  the  stake  at  Tomis  on  the  Black  Sea. St.  Julian,  a  priest  in  Galatia,  was  after  torture beheaded. *MACULL  (St.)  Bp.  (April  25)  

Otherwise  St.  MAUGHOLD,  which  see. *MADALBERTA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  7)

♦MADELGISILUS  (St.)  (May  30)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  disciple  and trusted  confidant  of  St.  Fursey.  After  some vears  of  monastic  life  at  St.  Riquier,  he,  together with  St.  Pulgan,  retired  to  a  hermitage,  near Monstrelet,  where  he  passed  away,  famous  for the  miracles  he  had  wrought  (A.D.  655). *MADEN  (MADERN)  (St.)  (May  17)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Breton  Saint  of  Cornish descent  to  whom  many  churches  are  dedicated. At  St.  Madern's  Well  in  Cornwall,  the  reputed site  of  his  hermitage,  many  miracles  have  been wrought  even  in  comparatively  recent  times. MADIR  (St.)  M.  (March  3)  

Otherwise  St.  HEMETERIUS,  which  see. *MADOES  (MADIANUS)  (St.)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Saint  who  has  left  his  name  to a  place  in  the  Carse  of  Gowrie.  Some  identify him  with  St.  Modocus  or  ^Edan  of  Ferns.  But another  tradition  makes  of  him  a  fellowmissionary  to  Scotland  with  St.  Bonifatius Quiritinus,  who  appears  to  have  been  sent from  Rome  to  preach  Christianity  in  North Britain.  It  seems  impossible  to  disentangle the  facts  from  the  accretions  to  the  legend. *MADRUN  (MATER1ANA)  (St.)  (April  9)  
(5th  cent.) A Welsh  or  Cornish Saint  to whom  some  Cornish  churches  are  dedicated. *M#:DOC  (MODOC,  ^EDAN,  EDAN) (Jan.  31) (St.)  Bp.

(13th  cent.) An  Abbot  of  Knock  (Louth), best  known  as  the  composer  in  verse  of  an Irish  Martyrology. *M,ffiLRHYS  (St.)  (Jan.  1)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  the  Isle  of  Bardsey, probably a Breton by birth, venerated in North  Wales. *Mi*ETHLIN  (AM^ETHLIN)  (St.)  (Dec.  26)

♦M^ELRUBIUS (MAOLRUBHA) (St.) (April  31) (8th cent.)  A member of St. Comgall's community  at  Ben-Chor, who, feeling  called to  a  missionary  life,  journeyed  to  Iona.  He

MAGINA 
afterwards  founded  a  church  at  Applecross  or Apurcrossan  (Isle  of  Skye),  where  his  ministry was  most  fruitful.  He  lived  to  an  advanced age,  and  some  traditions  have  it  that  he  ended by  dying  a  Martyr's  death  at  the  hands  of Danish  pirates  (a.d.  721).  

MAGINA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  3)  

See  SS.  CLAUDIUS,  CRISPINUS,  &c.  

♦MAGNOBODUS  (MAINBCEUFj  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  16) (7th  cent.)  A  Frank  of  noble  birth,  appointed at  the  demand  of  the  people,  Bishop  of  Angers. He  is  celebrated  for  his  works  of  charity  and also  for  the  many  miracles  Almighty  God enabled  him  to  perform.  He  died  about  a.d. 670.  

♦MAHARSAPOR  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  2)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Persian  Christian  who  suffered martyrdom  under  the  persecuting  King  Varanes (a.d.  421).  After  a  three  years'  imprisonment, he  was  thrown  into  a  pit  and  left  to  die  of hunger.  

MAGINUS  (MAXIMUS)  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  25)  
(4th  cent.)  A  hermit  in  the  mountainous country  round  Tarragona  in  Spain,  and  a  worker of  miracles.  He  was  beheaded  as  a  Christian about  A.D.  304.  It  is  possible  that  the  name Magi,  still  common  in  Tarragona,  is  a  reminiscence of  this  Saint.  

MAGLORIUS  (St.;  Bp.  (Oct.  24)  
(6th  cent.)  A  kinsman  of  St.  Samson,  Bishop of  D61  in  Brittany.  They  were  both  natives of  South  Wales,  and  educated  in  the  monastery of  St.  Illtyd  in  Glamorganshire.  They  crossed over  together  into  Brittany,  where  they  became heads  of  two  monasteries,  St.  Samson  of  Dol 
♦-. and  St.  Maglorius  of  Lanmeur.  On  the  death  of St.  Samson,  St.  Maglorius  was  chosen  as  his  successor ;  but,  because  of  his  old  age  and  desire  of solitude,  he  caused  St.  Budoc  to  be  accepted  in  his place  and  retired  to  the  sea-coast,  where  he  built himself  a  hut  or  cell.  Disciples  gathered  round him,  and  a  nobleman,  who  had  benefited  by his  prayers,  offered  him  the  Isle  of  Jersey  as a  home.  There  he  founded  a  monastery  and remained  until  his  death  (a.d.  586).  His  relics were  Anally  enshrined  at  Paris.  

MAGNERICUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  25)  
(6th  cent.)  The  disciple  and  successor  in the  Archbishopric  of  Treves  of  St.  Nicetius, whom  he  voluntarily  attended  into  exile  when that  holy  prelate  was  unjustly  banished  by King  Clothair.  King  Sigebert,  son  of  Clothair, recalled  the  Saints  and,  on  the  death  of  Nicetius, St.  Magnericus  was  unanimously  elected  in  his place  (A.D.  566).  His  virtues  and  learning brought  him  into  universal  esteem.  He  received many  marks  of  the  Royal  favour  from Kings  Sigebert  and  Childeric,  and  obtained from  the  latter  the  release  of  Theodore,  Bishop of  Marseilles,  wrongfully  accused  and  cast  into prison.  St.  Magnericus  was  an  intimate  friend of  St.  Gregory  of  Tours,  and  specially  devoted to  St.  Martin  of  Tours,  the  popular  Saint  of  his age.  He  dedicated  to  St.  Martin  several churches  and  a  famous  Benedictine  Abbey. St.  Magnericus  died  before  the  end  of  the  sixth century.  His  Life  was  written  by  Abbot Eberwin.

(12th  cent.)  A  native  of  the  Orkneys,  over which  he  was  set  as  Governor  by  the  King  of Norway,  the  then  Overlord  of  the  islands. St.  Magnus  was  plotted  against  and  in  the  end cruelly  murderecl. He  offered  up  his  life  for

MAGNUS  of  ANAGNI  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  19)  
(3rd  cent.)  Several  Saints  by  name  Magnus are  commemorated  on  Aug.  19.  The  St. Magnus  whose  relics  are  at  Anagni  and  who  is registered  in  the  Roman  Martyrology,  was  a Bishop  of  Trani  in  Sicily.  He  suffered  death under  Decius  (a.d.  250).  The  various  accounts we  have  of  him  and  of  the  others  of  the  same name  are  confusing  and  contradictory,  owing to  the  ancient  scribes  having  often  failed  to distinguish  the  one  from  the  other.  

MAGNUS,  CASTUS  and  MAXIMUS  (Sept.  4)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  No  mention  is  made  in  the Roman  Martyrology  of  the  place  or  date  of  the martyrdom  of  St.  Magnus  and  his  two  companions. However,  the  Bollandists  are  reasonably of  opinion  that  they  were  of  the  number of  seventeen  Martyrs  put  to  death  at  Ancyra in  Galatia,  and  that  their  names  were  accidentally separated  from  those  of  SS.  Rufinus, Sylvanus  and  Vitalicus  in  the  transcription  of the  Marty rologies.  Both  entries  occur  on  the same  day.  

♦MAGNUS  (MAGNOALDUS)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  6) (7th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  and  fellow-missionary  with  the Irish Saints, Columbanus and Gallus.  He  founded  the  Abbey  of  Fussen  in Bavaria,  and  passed  away  about  a.d.  666.  

MAGNUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  6)  
(7th  cent.)  A  member  of  the  illustrious Venetian  family,  Frigeria  who  became  Bishop of  Oderzo  in  the  Province  of  Treviso  on  the Adriatic.  Owing  to  the  inclusions  of  Rotari, King  of  the  Lombards,  St.  Magnus  transferred (a.d.  638)  his  See  to  Citta  Nuova,  a  new  town then  called  Heraclea  in  honour  of  the  Emperor Heraclius.  St.  Magnus  was  distinguished  for his  pastoral  zeal  and  for  his  personal  sanctity. He  founded  eight  of  the  most  prominent churches  of  Venice,  to  one  of  which  (San Oeremia)  his  body  was  transferred,  a.d.  1206. He  died  at  Heraclea  about  a.d.  660.  In  Italy St.  Magnus  is  in  the  list  of  Saints  styled  the Fourteen  Helpers.  

MAGNUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  5)  
(6th  cent.)  Beyond  the  fact  that  he  was of  the  family  of  the  Trinceri  and  occupied the  See  of  Milan  in  the  early  part  of  the  sixth century,  little  is  recorded  about  him  in  the Milanese  Kalendars  dating  from  the  eleventh century.  His  cultus  is  ancient  and  constant, and  his  virtues  are  extolled  in  various  documents. They  also  indicate  the  church  of  St. Eustorgius  as  his  place  of  burial.  

♦MAGUIL  (St.)  (May  30)  

Otherwise  St.  MADELGISILUS,  ivhich  see.  

♦MAIDOC  (MADOC)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  28)  

There  are  several  Welsh  and  Irish  Saints  of this  name.  Hardy  gives  the  following  as variants  of  the  word :  AIDNUS,  AIDAN, EDAN,  AIDUS,  EDUS,  EDA,  MAIDOC, M^EDOC,  MODOC,  MODOG,  MCEDOC, MCEG,  MOGUE,  MADOG.  The  best-known are  of  course  St.  EDAN  of  FERNS  (Jan.  31) and  St.  AIDAN  of  LINDISFARNE  (Aug.  31). The  St.  MAIDOC  assigned  to  Feb.  28  may  be the  sixth  century  Bishop  (or  perhaps  only Abbot),  after  whom  Llanmadog  in  Glamorganshire is  called.  

♦MAIDOC  (MOMH^EDOG)  (St.)  Abbot  (March  23) (5th  cent)  A  holy  Abbot  of  Fiddown  (Kilkenny). Various days are assigned for his festival,  owing  probably  to  his  being  confused with  others  of  the  same  name.  

♦MAILDULF  (St.)  (May  17)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irishman  by  birth  who, coming  to  England,  founded  the  great  Abbey of  Malmesbury,  where  he  had  St.  Aldhelin among  his  disciples,  and  where  he  ended  his holy  life,  a.d.  673. 
MAMMEA 

♦MAINE  (MEVENUS,  MEW  AN.  MEEN)  (June  21) (St.)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Welsh  or  Cornish  Saint,  disciple of  St.  Samson,  whom  he  accompanied  to Brittany.  He  founded  there  the  great  Abbey, since  known  as  St.  Meen.  He  was  all  his  life in  great  repute  of  sanctity,  and  died  at  a  great age  (a.d.  617).  

MAJOLUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (May  11)  
(10th  cent.)  A  French  Saint  born  about a.d.  906.  He  studied  at  Lyons  under  the famous  Abbot  Antony,  and  on  the  completion of  his  course  was  made  Archdeacon ;  but, when  chosen  to  fill  the  vacant  See  of  BesanQon, he  fled  to  Cluny  and  embraced  the  monastic life  under  the  Abbot  Aimard,  of  whom  he  became Coadjutor.  His  learning,  piety  and  merit gained  him  the  confidence  of  the  Emperor Otto  and  other  princes,  and  he  was  chosen to  reform  the  discipline  of  many  religious communities.  During  one  of  his  journeys  to Paris  he  fell  ill  at  Sauvigny,  and  died  in  the arms  of  his  brethren,  May  11,  a.d.  994.  His tomb  became  a  famous  resort  of  pilgrims.  

MAJORICUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  6)  
(5th  cent.)  The  son  of  St.  Dionysia,  who encouraged  him  to  welcome  his  martyrdom and  not  to  lose  his  wedding  garment,  which  was his  title  of  admission  to  the  Heavenly  Banquet. She  embraced  his  corpse  and  buried  him  with thanksgiving  in  her  own  house.  Both  mother and  son  suffered  martyrdom  during  the  Arian persecution  (about  a.d.  490)  in  Africa,  under Hunneric  the  Vandal.  

MALACHI  (St.)  Prophet.  (Jan.  14)  
(5th  cent.  B.C.)  The  last  of  the  Twelve Minor  Prophets  and  the  inspired  writer  of  one of  the  Canonical  Books  of  the  Old  Testament. The  tradition  is  that  he  was  of  Sapha  of  the Tribe  of  Zabulon.  He  is  a  Post-Exilic  Prophet. We  have  no  particulars  of  his  life  or  of  the place  of  his  burial.  It  is  held  by  some  that  he is  one  and  the  same  person  with  Esdras  (Ezra), prominent  among  the  Jews  at  the  time  of  the Return  from  the  Captivity.  The  Greeks  keep his  Feast  Day  on  Jan.  3.  

MALACHY  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  3)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  at  Armagh  (a.d.  1095) and  brought  up  under  the  care  of  the  famous Recluse,  Imhar  (O'Hagan),  Malachy  was  ordained priest  by  St.  Celsus.  He  was  successively Abbot  of  Ben-Chor,  Bishop  of  Connor and  Archbishop  of  Armagh  (a.d.  1132).  He at  once  set  about  restoring  the  discipline  of  the Church  of  Ireland  and  succeeded  in  raising  it in  great  part  to  its  former  splendour.  Pope Innocent  II  appointed  him  Papal  Legate  in Ireland.  However,  the  holy  man  resigned  the Primatial  See  and  retired  to  that  of  Down, the  territory  of  which  he  separated  from  the Diocese  of  Connor.  He  made  more  than  one journey  to  Rome,  and  on  his  return  from  the last  of  these,  died  at  Clair vaux,  the  great Cistercian  Abbey  ruled  over  by  his  friend, St.  Bernard  (Nov.  2,  a.d.  1148).  St.  Bernard has  left  us  a  magnificent  Panegyric  of  St. Malachy  and  his  work.  

MALCHUS  (St.)  M.  (March  28)  

See  SS.  RISCUS,  MALCHUS, &c.  

♦MALCHUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  10)  
(11th  cent.)  A  native  of  Ireland,  trained  in Winchester  monastery.  Chosen  first  Bishop of  Waterford,  he  was  consecrated  by  St.  Anselm. He  was  one  of  the  preceptors  of  St.  Malachy, and  is  much  eulogised  by  St.  Bernard  in  his Life  of  that  Saint.  He  built  Waterford  Cathedral, and  died  after  a.d.  1110.  There  having been  in  Ireland  in  his  time  several  Bishops  who passed  away  in  reputation  of  sanctity,  and  who had  relations  with  him,  it  is  difficult  to  disentangle certain  particulars  of  his  later  life  from the  happenings  in  the  career  of  certain  of  his contemporaries.  

MALCHUS  (St.)  (July  27)  

One  of  the  SEVEN  SLEEPERS,  which  see. 

MALCHUS  (St.)  (Oct.  21)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Syrian  who  entered  a  monastery at  Chalcis  near  Antioch  (a.d.  337).  After about  twenty  years  of  monastic  life,  while  on a  journey,  he  was  seized  by  marauding  Arabs, who  sold  him  for  a  slave  ;  nor  was  he  able  until after  seven  years  of  bondage  to  return  to  his monastery.  Before  his  death  he  came  to know  St.  Jerome,  who  drew  up  some  account of  him  from  what  the  Saint  communicated  to him  (a.d.  390  about).  

MALO  (MACHUTUS,  MACLOU)  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  15) (7th  cent.)  Of  Welsh  descent,  but  it  is  uncertain whether  he  was  born  in  Wales  or  in Brittany.  He  seems  to  have  been  brought up  in  the  monastery  of  St.  Cadoc  at  Llancaryan, and,  when  ordained  priest,  to  have  passed  into Brittany  with  a  band  of  Welsh  missionaries. He  settled  at  a  place  called  Aleth,  of  which  he is  recognised  as  the  first  Bishop.  For  a  time he  was  banished  from  his  Diocese  and  found  a welcome  awaiting  him  from  St.  Leontius,  Bishop of  Saintes.  He  returned  to  Aleth,  his  presence being  insisted  upon  by  his  people  ;  but,  feeling his  end  draw  near,  he  set  out  again  to  visit his  friend  St.  Leontius.  He  died  on  the  journey at  a  place  called  Archembray,  about  a.d.  630. The  greater  part  of  his  remains  were  translated to  St.  Malo.  In  his  Life,  written  by  the  monk Sigebert  of  Gemblours,  very  many  miracles  are related  as  wrought  by  him.  

♦MALRUBIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  27)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Scottish  hermit  who  met  his death  at  the  hands  of  heathen  marauders  about A.D.  1040.  

♦MALRUBIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  21)  
(8th  cent.) A  hermit  in  the  county  of  Ross 
in  Ireland,  where,  when  eighty  years  old,  he 
was  murdered  by  Danish  pirates  for  attempting 
to  preach  Christianity  to  them  (a.d.  721).  

MAMAS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  17)  

Otherwise  St.  MAMMAS,  which  see.  

MAMELTA  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  17)  
(5th  cent.)  Several  Martyrologies  register this  holy  woman,  who  probably  suffered  in  the fifth  century.  She  is  said  to  have  been  a heathen  priestess  in  Persia,  converted  to Christianity  by  the  instrumentality  of  her sister,  who  was  a  Christian.  She  was  baptised by  a  Bishop ;  but  while  still  wearing  her baptismal  robe,  was  seized  by  the  Pagans,  put  to the  torture,  stoned  and  finally  drowned  in  a  lake.  

MAMERTUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  11)  

Otherwise  St.  MAMMERTUS,  ivhich  see.  

MAMILIAN  (MAXIMILIAN;  (St.)  M.  (March  12) (3rd  cent.)  Some  authors  believe  him  to have  suffered  in  Rome  under  Alexander  Severus at  the  same  period  as  St.  Cecilia.  Others  assert that  he  was  put  to  death  in  Numidia,  about a.d.  295.  He  is  said  by  the  latter  to  have  been buried  on  a  little  hill  at  Carthage.  

MAMILLUS  (St.)  M.  (March  8)  
(Date  unknown.)  One  of  a  band  of  Martyrs in  Africa,  including  a  Bishop  by  name  Cyril. His  companions,  according  to  the  Roman Martyrology,  are  Felix,  Beata,  Herennius, Felicitas,  Urban,  Rogatus  and  Sylvanus.  In other  Martyrologies,  these  names  are  verbally changed  and  other  names  are  added.  

MAMMAS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  17)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Acta  of  this  Saint  are obscure  and  uncertain.  He  is  said  to  have  been of  noble  birth.  Some  even  describe  him  as having  been  a  Roman  Senator  ;  but  both  St. Basil  and  St.  Gregory  Nazianzen  refer  to  him as  having  been  of  humble  birth.  The  Bollandists  are  of  opinion  that  two  distinct  Martyrs of  the  same  name  are  at  times  confounded  by the  various  writers.  It  seems  likely  that  the St.  Mammas  in  special  veneration  suffered martyrdom  at  Caesarea  in  Cappadocia  under Aurelian  (a.d.  274).  

MAMMEA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  27)  

Otherwise St. MANNEA, which see with St.  MARCELLINUS.  

175 

MAMMERTUS 
MAMMERTUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  11)  
(5th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Simplicius in  the  See  of  Vienne  (France).  He  is  looked upon  as  the  originator  or  reviver  of  the  Rogation Day  Processions,  which  he  established  in  his Diocese  in  consequence  of  the  many  calamities which  at  that  time  afflicted  his  people.  His learning  and  the  miracles  he  wrought  were renowned,  among  the  latter  being  the  extinction of  two  fierce  fires  which  threatened  to  destroy Vienne,  and  which  extinction  St.  Avitus,  his successor,  in  his  Homily  on  the  Rogations, calls  miraculous.  This  St.  Mammertus  is  said to  be  the  Bishop  Mammertus  who  attended the  Council  of  Aries  (a.d.  475).  He  died  in that  same  year.  His  body  was  transferred from  Vienne  to  the  Cathedral  of  Orleans  in  the middle  of  the  sixth  century,  but  was  destroyed by  the  Calvinists  a  thousand  years  afterwards. The  Rogation  devotion  was  gradually  propagated to  the  whole  Western  Church.  

MANAHEN  (St.)  Prophet,  (May  24)  
(1st  cent.)  The  memory  of  this  Saint,  who  is mentioned  in  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles  (xiii.  1 ), is  recalled  in  all  the  ancient  Marty rologies. He  was  the  foster-brother  of  King  Herod Antipas,  Tetrarch  of  Galilee.  The  date  of  his death  Ls  unknown,  but  he  is  supposed  to  have died  at  Antioch  in  Svria.  

♦MANAKUS  (MANACCUS)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Oct.  14) (6th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Saint,  Abbot  at  Holyhead, connected  with  St.  Cybi.  He  appears thence  to  have  come  to  Cornwall,  where  he died.  Manaccan  (Minster),  near  Falmouth,  is said  to  owe  its  name  to  him.  

MANCIUS  (St.)  M.  (March  15)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Of  Roman  origin,  he appears  to  have  been  bought  as  a  slave  by Jewish  traders  and  taken  to  Evora  in  Portugal, where  he  fell  a  victim  to  his  masters'  hatred  of Christianity.  Churches  were  built  and  dedicated in  his  honour.  He  lived  probably  either in  the  fifth  or  in  the  sixth  centurv.  

♦MANCUS  (St.)  (May  31)  

See  SS.  WINNOW,  MANCUS  and  MYRBAD.  

MANDATUS  (St.)  M.  (June  10)  

See  SS.  BASILIDES,  TRIPODIUS,  &c.  

MANETTUS  (S.)  (Aug.  20)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Florentine  merchant  who became  one  of  the  Seven  Founders  of  the Servite  Order.  He  is  known  in  Italy  as  San Manetto  d'Antella.  He  changed  his  name  from Benedetto  to  Manetto  on  his  receiving  the Religious  habit.  From  Provincial  of  Tuscany he  became  General  of  his  Order.  He  attended the  Council  of  Lyons  (a.d.  1246)  as  Procurator of  the  Servites,  and  at  the  request  of  St.  Louis introduced  the  Order  into  France.  In  a.d. 1267  he  resigned  his  Generalate  to  St.  Philip Benizi,  and  died  in  the  following  year  at  Monte Senario,  the  chief  Servite  Convent.  

♦MANIRUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  19)  
(Date  uncertain.)  One  of  the  Apostles  of the  North  of  Scotland.  His  work  seems  chiefly to  have  been  the  promoting  of  good  feeling  and union  among  the  newly  converted  Highlanders. An  Office  in  his  honour  has  place  in  the  old Aberdeen  Breviary.  

MANNEA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  27)  

See  SS.  MARCELLINUS,  MANNEA, &c.  

MANNUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  4)  

Otherwise  St.  MAGNUS,  which  see.  

MANSUETUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  19)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth,  he  was  on account  of  his  great  learning  and  virtue  appointed to  the  important  See  of  Milan  (a.d.  672,  about). He  held  a  Synod  at  Milan,  and  attended  that of  Rome  convoked  (a.d.  680)  by  Pope  St.  Agatho against  the  Monothelites.  He  published  a  controversial treatise  against  these  same  heretics, and  was  in  many  ways,  both  by  his  writings  and the  example  he  gave  of  pastoral  zeal,  of  great service  to  religion.  He  died  about  A.D.  681.  

MANSUETUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  6)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Bishop  of  Toul  in  France, 176 

popularly  known  as  St.  Mansu  or  Mansuy. There  was  a  belief  that  he  was  a  disciple  of St.  Peter  the  Apostle  and  was  by  him  sent into  Gaul,  where  he  founded  the  See  of  Toul. But  the  better  founded  opinion  is  that  St. Mausuetus  was  by  birth  a  Scot,  and  that  he became  the  first  Bishop  of  Toul  during  the reign  of  the  Emperor  Constantius  (a.d.  337A.d.  350).  His  Apostolic  labours  were  so successful  and  illustrated  by  so  many  signs of  a  Divine  Mission  that  he  is  regarded  as  the Apostle  of  Lorraine.  St.  Gerard,  Bishop  of Toul,  made  a  solemn  Translation  of  his  Body (a.d.  971).  To  save  them  from  destruction, his  relics  were  at  the  time  of  the  great  French Revolution  dispersed  and  distributed  among various  churches. MANSUETUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  6)  

See  SS.  DONATIAN,  PRiESIDIUS, &c. MANSUETUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  28)  

See  SS.  PAPINIAN,  MANSUETUS,  &c. MANSUETUS, SEVERUS, APPIAN, DONATUS, 
HONORIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS)  (Dec.  30)  
(5th  cent.)  Most  Martyrologies  reckon  these Martyrs  to  have  been  ten  in  number.  They suffered  (it  would  seem)  at  Alexandria  in  Egypt about  a.d.  483,  in  connection  with  the  troubles and  persecutions  raised  by  the  Monophysite 
MANUEL,' SABEL  and  ISMAEL(SS.)  MM.  (June  17) (4th  cent.)  Persian  Martyrs ;  Christians instructed  in  sacred  and  profane  learning  and sent  by  their  King,  Baltan,  to  negotiate  for peace  with  the  Emperor  Julian  at  Chalcedon. The  tradition  is  that  Julian,  finding  that  they were  Christians,  had  them  arrested  and  condemned as  such.  They  were  thereupon beheaded  and  their  bodies  burned.  The  year a.d.  362  is  given  as  that  of  their  martyrdom. The  Emperor  Theodosius  the  Great  dedicated a  church  in  their  honour  at  Constantinople.  

♦MAOLRUAIN  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  7)  
(8th  cent.)  The  Founder  of  the  famous monastery  of  Tallagh  in  Ireland.  There,  he began  the  compilation  of  the  Martyrology known  by  the  name  of  that  place.  In  it  he was  assisted  by  St.  iEngus  the  Culdee.  St. Maolrain  died  at  Tallagh,  a.d.  792.  

MAPPALICUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  17) (3rd  cent.)  Sufferers  at  Carthage  during  the persecution  under  Decius  (a.d.  250).  St. Cyprian,  their  contemporary,  in  his  Epistle to  the  Martyrs  and  Confessors,  presents  St. Mappalicus  as  an  example  of  unconquerable Faith  and  of  triumph  in  argument  against  the sophistry  of  the  Pagans.  

MAPRILIS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  

See  SS.  MARTIAL,  SATURNINUS, &c.  

MARANA  and  CYRA  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  3)  
(5th  cent.)  Two  Christian  maidens  who  led an  austere  life  near  Bersea  in  Syria  in  the  fifth century.  They  were  the  Prototypes  of  the "  Anchoresses "  of  the  Middle  Ages.  They observed  continuous  silence,  admitting  only women  to  speak  with  them,  and  that  on  the single  day  of  Pentecost  in  each  year.  

MARCELLA  (St.)  Widow.  (Jan.  31)  
(5th  cent.)  St.  Jerome,  who  was  her  guest for  three  years  (a.d.  382),  styles  her  "  a  model of  widowhood  and  sanctity."  Under  his direction  she  studied  the  Scriptures  and  drew around  her  a  circle  of  Roman  ladies,  among whom  were  SS.  Paula  and  Eustochium.  We have  no  less  than  eleven  letters  addressed  to her  by  the  holy  Doctor  of  the  Church.  Her mansion  was  in  Rome,  and  was  plundered  by the  Goths  when  the  Imperial  city  was  sacked  by Alaric  and  his  barbarians  (A.D.  409).  The  Saint herself  was  savagely  scourged  for  concealing,  as the  Goths  thought,  money  and  treasures  which in  reality  had  been  already  distributed  by  her among  the  poor.  The  Saint  died  from  the effects  of  this  ill-treatment  about  a.d.  410.

See  SS.  SECUNDIANUS,  MARCELLIANUS, &c.  

MARCELLINA  (St.)  V.  (July  17)  
(4th  cent.)  The  sister  of  St.  Ambrose  of Milan.  She  was  a  Roman  lady  who  appears to  have  taken  the  place  of  their  deceased  parents in  regard  to  the  upbringing  of  the  brothers SS.  Ambrose  and  Satyrus.  Several  of  the writings  of  the  holy  Doctor  of  the  Church  are dedicated  to  his  sister,  and  we  have  three  of the  letters  he  addressed  to  her.  He  also publicly  referred  to  her  in  the  funeral  sermon he  preached  over  the  body  of  their  brother Satyrus,  wherein  he  dwells  on  the  family affection  which  bound  the  three  together. St.  Marcellina  received  the  veil  of  religion from  the  hands  of  Pope  Liberius  on  Christmas Day,  a.d.  353.  She  outlived  both  her  brothers, and  died  about  a.d.  398,  but  it  is  uncertain whether  at  Rome  or  at  Milan.  Her  remains repose  in  the  latter  city.  

MARCELLINUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  2)  

See  SS.  ARGEUS,  NARCISSUS,  &c.  

MARCELLINUS  of  ANCONA  (St.)  (Jan.  9)  
(6th  cent.)  A  native  of  Ancona  who  succeeded St.  Traso  as  Bishop  of  that  See  (a.d.  550). By  his  prayers  he  relieved  his  people  from  the attack  of  the  Goths  under  Totila.  He  is  also said  to  have  extinguished  with  a  Book  of  the Gospels  a  destructive  fire  which  was  threatening to  devastate  the  whole  town.  The  Sacred volume  was  treasured  as  a  relic  in  the  Cathedral of  Ancona,  where  the  remains  of  St.  Marcellinus repose  together  with  those  of  the  other  Patron Saints  of  the  city.  

MARCELLINUS  (St.)  M.  (April  6)  
(5th  cent.)  An  illustrious  friend  of  the  great St.  Augustine  of  Hippo,  who  dedicated  to  him his  memorable  book  "  Of  the  City  of  God." Marcellinus  was  a  Secretary  or  Minister  of  the Emperor  Honorius,  and  was  commissioned  by him  to  enforce  in  Africa  the  Imperial  edict against  the  Donatist  faction.  The  energy  and zeal  of  Marcellinus  so  infuriated  Marinus,  the leader  of  the  recalcitrants,  that  he  falsely accused  Marcellinus  of  complicity  with  the  rebel Heraclion,  and  caused  him  to  be  arrested  and to  be  put  to  death  without  even  the  formality of  a  trial.  Honorius,  in  calling  Marinus  to account,  referred  to  Marcellinus  as  a  man  of unblemished  character.  We  have  Funeral Discourses  on  the  latter  from  the  pens  both  of St.  Augustine  and  of  St.  Jerome.  

MARCELLINUS,  VINCENT  and  DOMNINUS 
(SS.)  (April  20)  
(4th  cent.)  African  Saints  who  crossed  over into  Gaul  as  missionaries.  On  reaching  Embrun, St.  Marcellinus  was  consecrated  first  Bishop  of that  city  by  St.  Eusebius  of  Vercelli.  Their labours  were  fruitful  in  the  gain  of  souls  to  God. a.d.  374  is  given  as  the  date  of  the  death  of St.  Marcellinus.  The  relics  of  the  three  Saints are  venerated  at  Digne,  in  the  Alps  of  Savoy.  

MARCELLINUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (April  26)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  by  birth,  St.  Marcellinus sat  in  the  Chair  of  St.  Peter  from a.d.  296  to  a.d.  304,  during  a  period  when  the persecution  of  Christianity  was  so  unrelenting that  no  less  than  seventeen  thousand  of  the Faithful  were  put  to  death  because  of  their religion.  The  Pope  suffered  with  three  others in  Rome,  a.d.  304  ;  and  the  four  bodies  are said  to  have  been  left  exposed  in  the  Forum to  intimidate  their  fellow-believers.  The  legend that  St.  Marcellinus  had  on  one  occasion  yielded in  the  torture  chamber  and  offered  incense  to an  idol,  afterwards  repenting  of  his  weakness, is  now  generally  discredited.  

MARCELLINUS  and  PETER  (SS.)  MM. (June  2) (4th cent.)  Peter, an Exorcist, and Marcellinus, a priest under whose direction he exercised  his  ministry,  were  prominent  among

Roman  Christians  at  the  beginning  of  the fourth  century.  Peter,  first  cast  into  prison, brought  about  by  his  patience  the  conversion of  his  gaoler  with  his  family.  Marcellinus baptised  them.  This  led  to  his  own  arrest. Condemned  to  death,  they  were  secretly  executed in  a  forest  at  a  place  unknown  to  other Christians  (a.d.  304).  However,  their  bodies were  discovered  and  interred  in  the  Catacombs. Their  tomb  was  adorned  with  a  metrical  epitaph later  in  the  century  by  Pope  St.  Damasus,  who states  that  he  had  heard  the  details  of  their Passion  from  the  executioner  who  had  beheaded them.  Their  remains,  many  centuries  afterwards, were  translated  to  Frankfort  in  Germany.

See  SS.  MARK  and  MARCELLIANUS.  

MARCELLINUS  (MARCHELM)  (St.)  (July  14)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  Saint  who devoted  himself  to  the  evangelisation  of  Holland, whither  he  followed  St.  Willibrord. Together  with  St.  Libuin,  he  preached  Christianity to  t  he  people  of  O  verYssel .  He  attended St.  Boniface  in  that  Saint's  visit  to  Rome  (a.d. 738).  St.  Marchelm  died  at  Oldensee,  but  his remains  were  translated  to  Deventer  and placed  near  those  of  St.  Libuin.  

MARCELLINUS, MANNEA, JOHN, SERAPION and  PETER  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  27)  
(4th  cent.)  A  husband  and  wife,  with  their three  sons,  arrested  as  Christians  (a.d.  304) and  done  to  death.  It  is  said  that  they  were not  beheaded  in  the  ordinary  way  of  the execution  of  death  sentences  in  the  Roman Empire  until  after  they  had  been  first  bound  to stakes  in  an  attempt  to  burn  them  alive  and afterwards  thrown  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the Amphitheatre,  but  miraculously  respected  both by  the  flames  and  by  the  brutes.  There  is some  controversy  as  to  the  place  of  their martyrdom,  whether  at  Oxyrynchus  in  Egypt, or  at  Tomi  on  the  Black  Sea.  

MARCELLINUS  of  RAVENNA  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  5) (3rd  cent.)  The  second  or  third  Bishop  of Ravenna.  Most  Italian  authors  describe  him as  having  occupied  that  See  in  the  second half  of  the  third  century,  and  add  that,  after  a long  and  zealous  Episcopate,  adorned  with virtues  and  the  gift  of  working  miracles,  he died,  weighed  down  and  broken  by  the  troublous events  of  his  time.  His  shrine  was  transferred from  the  seaport  of  Classe  to  the  town  of Ravenna,  a.d.  963.  

MARCELLUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Jan.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Marcellus  was  elected  Pope A.D.  308,  and  occupied  the  Chair  of  St.  Peter for  one  year  only.  The  tyrant  Maxentius,  soon to  be  overthrown  by  Constantine,  had,  however, time  to  have  the  holy  man  seized,  scourged, and  condemned  to  be  degraded  to  the  position of  a  labourer  in  the  Imperial  stables.  Rescued for  a  time  from  this  degradation,  he  was  received by  the  holy  Christian  woman  Lucina  into  her mansion,  an  apartment  which  she  had  transformed into  a  church,  he  regained  a  little liberty.  Maxentius,  however,  discovered  him quickly  and  converted  the  church  into  a stable,  forcing  the  Pontiff  to  take  up  again  the wretched  work  to  which  he  had  sentenced  him. Broken  down  by  suffering,  St.  Marcellus  died on  Jan.  16  of  the  following  year,  a.d.  309,  and was  buried  by  Lucina  in  the  Catacombs.  His relics  were  later  translated  to  the  Roman church  which  bears  his  name.  

MARCELLUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  19)  

See  SS.  PUBLIUS,  JULIAN,  &c.  

MARCELLUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  9)  
(6th  cent.)  A  native  of  Avignon  and  younger brother  of  St.  Petronius,  Bishop  of  St.  Die, at  whose  death  St.  Marcellus  was  chosen  to  be his  successor,  although  at  the  time  only  a  deacon. He  was  consecrated  by  St.  Mamertus,  Arch
177 

MARCELLUS 
bishop  of  Vienne.  At  first,  the  then  King  of Burgundy,  an  Arian,  encouraged  those  of  his sect  to  persecute  the  Saint ;  but  the  prince himself  was  later  converted  and  became  one  of the  Bishop's  warmest  friends  and  supporters. St.  Gregory  of  Tours  styles  St.  Marcellus  "  a man  of  eminent  sanctity,"  and  there  are  several Hymns  which  extol  him  as  a  worker  of  miracles. He  died  at  the  beginning  of  the  sixth  century, after  an  Episcopate  of  forty  years,  at  an  Abbey in  the  Diocese  of  Frejus.  Both  St.  Die  and Frejus  treasured  portions  of  his  relics  until they  were  scattered  by  the  Huguenots  in  a.d. 1562.  

MARCELLUS  and  ANASTASIUS  (June  29)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  Roman  citizerjs  who,  during  the persecution  under  the  Emperor  Aurelian,  were sent  by  Pope  St.  Stephen  into  Gaul  to  join others  in  preaching  and  spreading  the  Gospel. They  were  put  to  death  as  Christians  in  the neighbourhood  of  Bourges.  St.  Anastasius expired  on  the  rack,  but  St.  Marcellus  survived to  be  beheaded  (a.d.  274).  Their  memory  is preserved  not  only  in  legends  and  traditions, but  in  the  monuments  and  ruins  in  the  surrounding country.  A  church  in  the  town  still  bearing the  name  of  Saint-Marcel  possesses  their  relics.  

MARCELLUS  of  APAMEA  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  14) (4th  cent.)  A  native  of  Cyprus  who  for  some time  fulfilled  the  functions  of  a  lay  magistrate. In  this  office  he  so  righteously  combined  justice and  mercy  that  on  a  vacancy  occurring  in  the See  of  Apamea  in  Syria  he  was  acclaimed  by the  people  of  the  place  their  next  Pastor.  He was  as  successful  and  as  popular  as  a  Bishop as  he  had  been  as  a  magistrate.  But  the fervour  of  his  zeal  led  to  his  martyrdom.  The Emperor  Theodosius  had  decreed  that,  throughout the  Roman  world  all  idols  should  be  overthrown (A.D.  385) ;  and  the  zealous  Bishop, in  seeking  to  have  the  Imperial  Edict  carried out  in  his  Diocese,  was  murdered  by  assassins hired  by  the  remaining  Pagans  (a.d.  389).  

MARCELLUS  of  TREVES  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  4)  
(Date  unknown.)  Both  Tongres  and  Treves claim  this  Saint  as  having  been  one  of  their early  Bishops.  We  know  little  or  nothing about  him  of  which  we  can  be  certain.  A tenth  century  History  of  the  Bishops  of  Tongres complains  that  the  records  of  many  Bishops, including  those  of  St.  Marcellus,  had  been destroyed  by  the  Huns  in  their  incursions  during the  fifth  century.  

MARCELLUS  of  CHALON  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  4)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  priest  of  Lyons  who  escaped from  the  prison  into  which  he,  with  other Christians,  had  been  thrown  during  the  persecution under  Marcus  Aurelius,  and  betook  himself to  preach  the  Gospel  to  the  inhabitants  of the  country  watered  by  the  River  Saone. Here  he  was  again  arrested  and  put  to  the torture.  The  witnessing  of  his  agonies  was made  a  feature  of  the  public  games  celebrated on  one  of  the  Pagan  festivals.  At  their  close, being  still  alive,  he  was  buried  up  to  the  waist and  left  to  die.  We  are  told  that  he  expired on  the  third  day  with  the  Praises  of  God  on  his lips  (a.d.  178).  He  is  variously  called  St. Marcel  and  St.  Marceau,  and  several  churches in  Burgundy  have  him  for  their  Title  Saint.  

MARCELLUS,  CASTUS,  ^EMILIUS  and  SATURNINUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  6)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  period  and  place  of martyrdom  of  these  Saints  is  very  uncertain. The  Roman  Martyrology  refers  them  to  Capua, but  whether  that  city  was  the  scene  of  their sufferings  or  whether  they  were  (as  their  names seem  to  indicate)  African  Christians  whose bodies  were  brought  over  to  Italy,  is  a  matter of  pure  conjecture.

See  SS.  APULEIUS  and  MARCELLUS.  

MARCELLUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  30)  
(3rd  cent.) The  Official  "  Acts  "  report  that 
178 

during  a  festival  at  Tangier  (Africa)  in  honour of  the  birthday  of  the  Emperor  Maximian Herculeus,  a  centurion  by  name  Marcellus refused  to  take  part  in  the  religious  (Pagan) rites  and,  declaring  himself  a  soldier  of  Christ, the  Eternal  King,  threw  down  his  arms  and insignia,  and  that  he  was  thereupon  arrested and  imprisoned  and  in  the  end  beheaded  (a.d. 298).  These  official  Acts  should  have  been written  out  by  St.  Cassian  (Dec.  3),  the  notary of  the  Court.  But  he  was  so  indignant  at  the injustice  of  the  sentence  that  he  threw  down his  stylus  and  parchment  and  refused  to  write, for  which  action  he  was  imprisoned  and  afterwards condemned  to  death.  The  Spanish tradition  that  St.  Marcellus  was  the  brother  of St.  Nona  is  unreliable.  

MARCELLUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  1)  
(5th  cent.)  On  the  death  of  Prudentius, Bishop  of  Paris,  this  Saint  was  acclaimed  his successor  by  clergy  and  people,  on  account of  his  great  virtue  and  wonderful  gift  of  miracles . He  probably  died  at  the  beginning  of  the  fifth century,  but,  according  to  some  authors,  he survived  until  a.d.  436.  He  was  buried  in  the old  Christian  cemetery  outside  the  walls  of Paris,  where  now  is  the  suburb  of  Saint-Marceau. His  relics  disappeared  from  the  Cathedral  during the  great  Revolution.  A  well-known  Paris church  has  St.  Marcellus  for  its  Title.

(4th cent.) A priest of Nicomedia (Asia 
Minor),  who  during  the  reign  of  the  Emperor 
Constantius was seized by the Arians and 
hurled  to  his  death  from  a  high  rock  (a.d.  349).

(5th  cent.)  A  native  of  Apamea  in  Syria who  renounced  his  fortune  in  favour  of  his younger  brother  and  of  the  poor  and  joined  the monastic  Order  of  the  Acaemetes,  so-called  on account  of  their  recital  of  the  Divine  Office day  and  night  without  interruption.  He  became Abbot  of  the  monastery  and  founded several  others.  He  attended  St.  Flavian's Council  of  Constantinople  against  the  Eutychian heretics.  His  chronicler,  Metaphrastes,  ascribes to  him  all  the  distinguishing  traits  and  virtues of  the  Prophets  and  Apostles.  He  died  about A.D.  485.

MARCIAN  (St.)  (Jan.  10)  
(5th  cent.)  Although  born  in  Constantinople, he  belonged  to  a  Roman  family  connected  with the  Imperial  House  of  Theodosius.  From  his youth  he  devoted  himself  to  prayer,  fasting  and almsdeeds,  and  in  his  charity  went  so  far  as  to sell  a  considerable  patrimony  and  distribute the  proceeds  among  the  poor.  He  also  founded many  churches  and  transformed  the  chapel called  Anastasia  into  a  vast  Basilica.  The Patriarch  Anatolius  persuaded  him  to  receive Sacred  Orders ;  and  the  Patriarch  Gennadius entrusted  him  with  the  high  office  of  Treasurer of  the  Church  of  St.  Sophia.  He  died  in  the odour  of  sanctity  about  A.D.  489.  

MARCIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (March  6)  
(2nd  cent.) The  first  Bishop  of  Tortona  in 
Piedmont,  and  Patron  Saint  of  that  city.  He 
was  a  disciple  of  the  Apostle  St.  Barnabas ; 
and  after an Episcopate  of  forty-five years, 
MARGARET 

obtained  the  palm  of  martyrdom,  about  a.d. 120,  during  the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Hadrian. St.  Innocent,  one  of  his  successors,  enshrined his  body  in  a  church  titled  after  him.

MARCIAN  of  AUXERRE  (St.)  (April  20)  
(5th  cent.)  A  native  of  Bourges,  of  humble birth,  who  was  admitted  as  a  lay-brother  into the  monastery  of  St.  Germanus  at  Auxerre. There  he  discharged  menial  duties  and  had charge  of  the  cattle  on  the  Abbey  farm.  After a  life  of  great  holiness,  witnessed  to  by  the gift  of  working  miracles,  he  died  while  devoutly keeping  the  Festival  of  Easter  in  some  year between  a.d.  466  and  A.d.  477,  and  was  buried in  the  church  of  his  monastery.  

MARCIAN  of  RAVENNA  (St.)  Bp.  (May  22)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  fourth  Bishop  of  Ravenna, where  he  is  honoured  with  a  special  festival. He  ruled  the  Diocese  from  about  a.d.  112 until  a.d.  127,  when  he  died  and  was  buried with  his  predecessor,  St.  Eleucadius.  He  is known  in  Italy  as  San  Mariano.  

MARCIAN,  NICANOR,  APOLLONIUS  and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  5)  
(4th  cent.)  Egyptian  Martyrs  in  the  persecution under  Diocletian  and  Galerius,  at  the beginning  of  the  fourth  century.  Some  curious details  are  given  of  their  sufferings.  They  were exposed  without  food  or  drink  to  the  rays  of the  June  sun,  and  at  the  same  time  choice  viands and  cooling  drinks  were  laid  out  near  them  to be  had  at  the  price  of  offering  incense  to  an  idol. They  kept  repeating  the  words  of  Christ :  "  Not in  bread  alone  does  man  live  "  ;  and  persevered to  the  end  chanting  the  praises  of  God.  

MARCIAN  of  SYRACUSE  (St.,)  Bp.,  M.  (June  14) (Date  uncertain.)  Said  to  have  been  the first  Bishop  of  Syracuse  and,  according  to  the Sicilian  tradition,  sent  there  as  missionary by  St.  Peter  the  Apostle  himself.  But,  as  the date  of  his  death  (which  is  said  to  have  been brought  about  by  the  action  of  the  Jews) cannot,  according  to  the  best  authorities,  be placed  before  a.d.  254  about,  it  is  more  likely that  by  St.  Peter  is  meant  the  Pope  of  the time,  regarded  as  holding  the  place  of  the Apostle.  St.  Marcian  would  thus  be  a  third century  Saint.  It  appears  that  during  the Saracen  invasion  of  Sicily  the  relics  of  St. Marcian  were  secretly  transferred  to  Gaeta.

(3rd  cent.)  A  youth  of  Iconium  in  Lycaonia (Asia  Minor)  who  bravely  confessed  Christ, notwithstanding  the  savage  tortures  to  which he  was  subjected.  Before  he  was  Anally  given over  to  the  executioner,  his  tongue  had  been cut  out  to  make  him  cease  from  the  prayers he  addressed  in  a  loud  voice  to  his  Redeemer (A.D.  243).

MARCIAN  (St.)  (Nov.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Syrian  hermit,  for  an  account of  whom  we  are  indebted  to  the  famous  writer Theodoret.  Marcian  fled  from  the  Imperial Court  in  which  he  had  a  certain  prospect  of advancement  to  the  desert  near  Chalcis,  where he  built  himself  a  hut  and  passed  his  life  in prayer  and  penance.  He  soon  gathered disciples  about  him.  Among  them  were Eusebius,  afterwards  a  law-giver  to  Solitaries, and  Agapetus,  who  later  became  Bishop  of Apamea.  He passed away about A.D. 387. 

He  was  buried  in  secret  at  his  own  request in  an  out-of-the-way  place,  but  his  tomb  was discovered  after  many  years  and  became  a  noted place  of  pilgrimage.  

MARCIANA  (St.)  V.M.  (Jan.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  A  zealous  Christian  maiden  in Mauritania  (Africa)  who  was  accused  of  having shattered  a  statue  of  the  goddess  Diana,  and on  her  arrest,  having  steadily  persevered  in  her confession  of  Christ,  was  thrown  to  the  wild beasts  at  the  public  games  in  the  Amphitheatre. She  was,  says  the  account  we  have,  gored  to death  by  a  wild  bull.  She  was  one  of  the innumerable  sufferers  at  the  beginning  of  the fourth  century  under  Diocletian  and  Maximian Herculeus.

(4th  cent.)  According  to  the  Bollandists and  others,  this  St.  Marciana  is  identical  with the  Saint  of  the  same  name  commemorated on  Jan.  9  as  having  suffered  in  Africa,  where she  was  gored  by  a  bull  in  the  Amphitheatre. The  Roman  Martyrology  notes  Toledo  as  the place  of  martyrdom  of  the  Saint  of  July  12, but  this  can  hardly  be.  There  is  at  Toledo no  tradition  or  other  trace  of  such  a  Saint  as a  local  heroine.

(6th  cent.)  An  Italian  hermit,  one  of  the Saints  whose  merits  are  enlarged  upon  by St.  Gregory  the  Great  in  his  Book  of  Dialogues. Peter  the  Deacon,  the  old  historian  of  the Abbey  of  Monte  Cassino,  describes  St.  Marcius (or  Martin,  as  he  calls  him)  as  a  wonder-worker, who  after  spending  some  time  at  Monte  Cassino, retired  into  a  cave  on  Mount  Massicus  (Mondragone),  where  he  died  in  the  odour  of  sanctity about  a.d.  579.  His  relics  were  (a.d.  1094) translated  to  the  town  of  Carinola,  part  of them  being  at  the  same  time  taken  to  Monte Cassino.  

♦MARCULPHUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (May  1)

M AREAS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  22)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  victims  of  the  persecution of  Christians  instituted  by  King  Sapor  II in  Persia.  Together  with  St.  Mareas,  there suffered  St.  Bicor  and  twenty  other  Bishops, nearly  two  hundred  and  fifty  Ecclesiastics,  and many  monks  and  nuns.  A  great  number  of Christian  laymen  laid  down  their  lives  at  the same  time  for  Christ ;  and  the  already  flourishing Church  of  Persia  was  brought  to  the verge  of  extinction.  The  martyrdom  of  the Saints  commemorated  on  April  22  took  place a.d.  342,  that  is,  in  the  year  following  the death  of  St.  Simeon,  Archbishop  of  Seleucia, looked  up  to  by  the  Faithful  in  Persia  as  their leader.  

♦MARGARET  of  HUNGARY  (Bl.)  V.  (Jan.  28)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Princess  of  Hungary  who became  a  Dominican  nun  and  lived  a  life  of sanctity  in  a  convent  she  had  founded  near Buda-Pesth  on  an  island  in  the  Danube,  now called  after  her.  She  died  a.d.  1271.

MARGARET 
♦MARGARET  of  ENGLAND  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  3)  
(12th  cent.)  An  Englishwoman,  probably related  to  St.  Thomas  of  Canterbury.  She appears  to  have  shared  his  exile  and  to  have died  a  Cistercian  nun  in  some  convent  near Laon  in  France  (A.D.  1192),  twenty  years  after his  Martyrdom. MARGARET  of  CORTONA  (St.)  (Feb.  22)  

Penitent.  

(13th  cent.)  Born  at  Laviano,  a  small  town in  Tuscany  (A.I).  1247),  Margaret  strayed  from the  path  of  virtue  in  her  youth  and  led  a  sinful life  for  about  nine  years.  But  the  sudden death  of  one  with  whom  she  had  sinned  startled her ;  and,  regarding  it  as  a  judgment  from Heaven,  she  resolved  upon  doing  lifelong  penance for  her  past  transgressions.  With  this intent  she  repaired  to  Cortona  and  placed herself  under  the  direction  of  the  Franciscan Fathers.  She  gave  herself  up  thenceforth  to prayer  and  chastising  of  the  flesh,  persevering in  her  efforts  to  atone  in  some  measure  for  the evil  she  had  done  until  her  death,  which happened  A.D.  1297,  twenty-four  years  after her  conversion.  She  died  at  Cortona  in  the odour  of  sanctity,  and  was  buried  in  the  church of  St.  Basil,  later  known  as  that  of  St.  Margaret.
♦MARGARET  POLE  (Bl.)  M.  (May  28)  
(16th  cent.)  A  woman  of  irreproachable  life, a  Plantagenet  of  the  Blood  Royal  of  England, Countess  of  Salisbury,  and  nearly  related  to King  Henry  VIII.  She  married  Sir  Richard Pole,  a  knight,  and  became  the  mother  of  the celebrated  Cardinal  Reginald  Pole.  Her  son being  abroad  and  beyond  his  reach,  the  tyrant revenged  himself  on  the  pious  and  virtuous widow,  ever-faithful  too  to  the  Catholic  Faith. As  she  had  committed  no  crime  on  which  she could  be  arraigned  before  a  jury,  Henry  proceeded by  Bill  of  Attainder  and  had  the  holy woman's  head  struck  off  on  Tower  Hill,  May  28, A.D.  1541. MARGARET  of  SCOTLAND  (St.)  (June  10)  

Queen,  Widow.  

(11th  cent.)  The  grand-daughter  of  King Edmond  Ironside,  sister  of  Edgar  Atheling,  and through  her  mother  related  to  St.  Stephen, King  of  Hungary.  In  exile  during  the  Danish domination  in  England,  St.  Margaret  with  the rest  of  the  Royal  Family  lived  in  England  during the  reign  of  St.  Edward  the  Confessor.  After the  death  of  the  latter,  St.  Margaret's  mother, a  Hungarian  princess,  was  compelled  to  seek refuge  for  her  children  and  herself  on  the Continent  from  the  Normans,  who  had  become masters  of  England.  A  storm  drove  the  ship on  which  she  had  embarked  on  to  the  coast of  Scotland.  They  were  welcomed  by  King Malcolm  III,  who  made  Margaret  his  Queen. The  Saint  used  her  influence  as  Queen  for  the good  of  religion  and  for  the  promotion  of justice.  She  had  especial  thought  for  the  poor, nor  would  suffer  any  to  be  oppressed.  Among the  pious  foundations  she  made  was  the  Abbey of  Dunfermline.  In  her  private  life  she  was devoted  to  prayer.  The  Book  of  the  Gospels she  studied  is  still  preserved  in  the  Bodleian Library  at  Oxford.  She  foretold  the  day  of her  death,  which  occurred  Nov.  16,  A.D.  1093, on  which  day  her  festival  is  still  celebrated  in Scotland,  though  in  other  countries,  by  Papal Decree,  kept  on  June  10. MARGARET  (St.)  V.M.  (July  20)  
(3rd  cent.)  Of  her  Alban  Butler  writes : "  According  to  the  ancient  Martyrologies,  she suffered  at  Antioch  in  Pisidia  (Asia  Minor), during  the  last  general  persecution.  She  is said  to  have  been  instructed  in  the  Faith  by  a Christian  nurse,  to  have  been  prosecuted  by  her own  father,  a  priest  of  idols  ;  and  after  many torments  to  have  gloriously  finished  her  martyrdom by  the  sword."  There  can  be  no  doubt about  the  antiquity  and  universality  of  the devotion  to  St.  Margaret  existing  throughout Europe, to which the number of churches 
180 

dedicated  to  her  bear  witness.  Many  legends have  gathered  about  her  memory,  to  one  of which  is  due  the  practice  of  painters  and sculptors  to  figure  her  as  trampling  on  a  dragon. MARGARET  (St.)  Widow.  (Aug.  27)  
(14th  cent.)  A  poor  girl  of  a  village  near Ancona  in  Italy,  who  in  her  fifteenth  year  was married  to  a  man  who  ill-treated  her  for  many years.  She  bore  with  patience  all  that  befell her,  and  after  her  husband's  death  passed  the rest  of  her  days  in  prayer  and  hard  work.  She died  A.D.  1395.  Many  miracles  have  since borne  witness  to  the  sanctity  of  her  humble  and hidden  life.
♦MARGARET  of  LOUVAIN  (Bl.)  V.M. (Sept.  2)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Flemish  maiden  who  died  in defence  of  her  chastity,  and  whose  shrine  is  at Louvain. MARGARET  MARY  ALACOQUE  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  17)  
(17th  cent.)  Born  A.D.  1647,  this  highly privileged  Servant  of  God  passed  her  whole  life in  prayer  and  seclusion  as  a  nun  of  the  Order  of the  Visitation,  at  Paray-le-Monial  in  Burgundy. From  a  Revelation  made  to  her  by  Our  Lord Himself,  she  was  led  to  enter  upon  her  great work,  the  spreading  of  Devotion  to  the  Sacred Heart  of  Jesus.  In  beginning  this  she  experienced and  overcame  many  difficulties  and  much opposition.  But  in  the  course  of  the  centuries that  have  elapsed  since  her  time  the  devotion has  become  worldwide,  and  among  those  dearest to  the  hearts  of  Christian  people.  St.  Margaret passed  away  A.D.  1690.  She  was  beatified  by Pope  Pius  IX  and  canonised  by  Benedict  XV.
♦MARGARET  COLONNA  (Bl.)  V.  (Dec.  30)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Roman  maiden  of  the  princely house  of  Colonna,  assiduous  in  the  nursing  of the  sick  poor,  and  venerated  even  before her  death  on  account  of  her  gift  of  contemplative prayer  and  of  the  innocence  of  her  life. She  died  A.D.  1284.
♦MARIANA  of  PAREDES  (Bl.)  V.  (May  26)  
(17th  cent.)  She  is  called  Mariana  of  Jesus and  "  the  lily  of  Qwito  (Equador),"  where  she was  born  (a.d.  1618)  of  noble  and  pious  parents. From  her  childhood  she  gave  signs  of  being destined  by  God  to  reach  a  high  degree  of sanctity  ;  but  finding  that  she  was  not  called to  a  conventual  life  she  practised  in  her  own home  the  austerities  usual  in  a  religious  community, and  devoted  her  time  to  prayer  and meditation.  She  died  May  26,  a.d.  1645.
♦MARIANUS  SCOTUS  (MUREDH7E)  (Bl.)  

Abbot.  (Feb.  9)  
(11th  cent.)  An  Irishman  by  birth  who, after  embracing  the  religious  life  at  Dunkeld in  Scotland,  journeyed  first  to  Rome,  and finally  founded  (A.D.  1074)  a  monastery  at Ratisbon  in  Germany.  He  was  eminent  for his  great  learning  and  has  left  many  valuable writings. MARIANUS  (St.)  (April  20)  

Otherwise  St.  MARCIANUS,  which  see. MARIANUS,  JAMES  and  OTHERS  (April  30)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  period  of  their  martyrdom appears  to  have  been  about  a.d.  259,  after  the death  of  St.  Cyprian,  who  is  mentioned  in  the account  we  have  as  having  appeared  to  St. Marianus  and  invited  him  to  share  his  crown. St.  James  was  a  deacon,  but  St.  Marianus  only a  reader.  They  suffered  at  Zambessa,  an ancient  town  in  Numidia  (Algiers). MARIANUS  (St.)  (Aug.Jtf  <  )  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  Solitary  who  was  renowned for  his  austerities  and  miracles.  His  hermitage was  in  Berri  (France),  and  St.  Gregory  of  Tours relates  several  miracles  wrought  by  the  holy man. MARIANUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  17)

(Date unknown.) In the ancient Martyrologies, this  Saint  is variously styled  Maria,

or  Mariana.  It  is  also  sometimes  spelled Marianus.  The  place  of  martyrdom  is  set down  as  Alexandria,  but  there  is  no  record of  who  the  Saint  was  or  when  she  lived.  Some authors  associate  her  with  a  St.  Theoniiis  who is  equally  unknown. MARINA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  18)  
(Date  unknown.)  According  to  the  Roman Martyrology  this  Saint  was  put  to  death  at Orense  in  Galicia  (Spain),  where  her  relics  are enshrined  in  a  church  dedicated  to  her,  as  are others  at  Cordova  and  Seville.  But  all  records concerning  this  St.  Marina  as  those  concerning several  others  of  the  same  or  similar  name  are lost. MARINUS  (AMARINUS)  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  25)

Otherwise  St.  MAURUS,  which  see. MARINUS  and  ASTERIUS  (SS.)  MM. (March  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  Eusebius  relates  that  Marinus,  a soldier  who  was  secretly  a  Christian,  on  being about  to  be  promoted  to  the  rank  of  centurion, was  denounced  by  a  rival  candidate  who  had come  to  know  of  his  comrade's  conversion.  The governor  of  Palestine,  after,  as  usual  in  such cases,  tempting  the  poor  soldier  by  offers  of favour  and  advancement  to  deny  Christ,  had him  beheaded  at  Caesarea,  a.d.  262.  Asterius, a  Roman  Senator  who  was  witness  of  the martyrdom,  took  away  the  body  of  St.  Marinus and  gave  it  decent  burial.  His  own  martyrdom quickly  followed  upon  this  act  of  Christian charity. MARINUS,  THEODOTUS  and  SEDOPHA  (July  5)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  who  suffered  as 
Christians  at  Tomis  on  the  Black  Sea.  Their 
names  occur,  though  variously  spelled,  in  most 
of  the  old  Martyrologies  and  Kalendars.  

MARINUS  (St.)  M.  (July  10)  

See  SS.  JANUARIUS,  MARINUS, &c. MARINUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  8)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  aged  man,  a  native  of  Cilicia (Asia  Minor),  who  having  embraced  the  Christian religion  and  converted  many  other  Pagans, was  arrested  in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian, put  to  the  torture,  and  afterwards  executed. The  Roman  Martyrology  registers  him  as  having been  cast  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the  Amphitheatre. Another  account  drawn  up  in  the East  states  that  he  was  beheaded.  The  date given  is  A.D.  290. MARINUS  (St.)  (Sept.  4)  
(4th  cent.)  Born  of  Christian  parents  in  an island  off  the  coast  of  Dalmatia,  Marinus  was by  profession  a  stone-mason.  Hearing  that the  town  of  Rimini  (Italy)  was  being  rebuilt, he  travelled  thither  with  a  fellow  artisan,  St. Leo,  and  was  astonished  to  find  among  the workmen  many  Christians  of  high  birth  who  had been  sentenced  to  hard  labour  because  of  their refusal  to  sacrifice  to  the  gods.  The  two  holy men  sought  to  comfort  them  and  to  alleviate their  sufferings,  so  far  as  was  in  their  power. At  the  end  of  three  years,  Leo  retired  to  Montefiascone ;  and  St.  Gaudentius,  Bishop  of Rimini,  recognising  the  merits  of  St.  Marinus, ordained  him  deacon,  so  that  he  might  bo entitled  to  baptise  the  numerous  converts  he was  making.  In  his  old  age  St.  Marinus  withdrew to  a  hermitage  in  the  heart  of  a  wood, about  ten  miles  from  Rimini.  There  he  died some  time  in  the  fourth  century.  A  town built  on  the  spot  and  called  after  the  holy  man has  become  well  known  as  the  Republic  of San  Marino.  The  relics  of  St.  Marinus  repose in  its  principal  church. MARINUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  26)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman,  son  of  a  Senator, who  laid  down  his  life  for  Christ  towards  the close  of  the  third  century.  It  is  related  of  him that  he  was  miraculously  freed  from  the  horrors of  the  torture  chamber  ;  that  the  wild  beasts of the Amphitheatre refused to harm him 

and  licked  his  hands  ;  and  that,  dragged  into  a temple,  the  idols  fell  shattered  to  the  ground. He  was  in  the  end  beheaded,  and  his  body recovered  and  buried  bv  the  Christians.  

MARIUS  (MARIS), MARTHA, ABACHUM and AUDIFAX  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  19)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Persian  nobleman  who  with  his wife,  Martha,  and  their  two  sons,  Audifax  and Abachum,  had  journeyed  to  Rome  to  visit  and venerate  the  tombs  of  the  Apostles.  Claudius II  was  at  the  time  persecuting  the  Christians, and  the  zealous  Persians  set  themselves  forthwith to  the  dangerous  work  of  ministering  to the  Faithful  in  prison  and  of  recovering  and burying  their  bodies  after  martyrdom.  They were  soon  themselves  arrested,  tried  and  condemned to  death.  The  father  and  his  sons  were beheaded,  but  St.  Martha  was  thrown  into  a deep  well  (a.d.  270).  Their  relics  are  enshrined in  the  church  of  St.  Hadrian,  close  to  the Roman  Forum.

MARK  and  TIMOTHY  (SS.)  MM.  (March  24)  
(2nd  cent.)  Pope  St.  Pius  I  (i.D.  158-167) mentions  these  two  Martyrs,  describing  them  as Priests,  in  a  letter  to  Justus,  Bishop  of  Vienne in  Gaul.  The  Pope  recalls  that  they  had  been brought  up  by  the  Apostles  and  exhorts  all  to follow  the  example  of  steadfastness  they  had given  to  the  Church.  Baronius  is  of  opinion that  this  St.  Timothy  was  a  son  of  the  Senator Pudens,  and  a  brother  of  SS.  Pudentiana  and Praxedes.  a.d.  148  is  a  probable  date  for  their martyrdom.  

MARK  (St.)  Evangelist.  (April  25)  
(1st  cent.)  The  inspired  writer  of  one  of  the Gospels.  That  he  was  of  Jewish  extraction may  fairly  be  inferred  from  the  fact  that  his writings  abound  in  Hebraisms.  Venerable Bede  is  of  opinion  that  he  was  of  the  race  of Aaron,  that  is,  of  the  priestly  caste.  It  is controverted  whether  he  is  the  "  John  who  is surnamed  Mark  "  (Acts  xii.  25)  who  was  for some  time  the  companion  of  Saul  and  Barnabas in  the  first  part  of  their  ministry.  The  Roman Martyrology,  following  the  statements  of  several of  the  Fathers,  styles  him  "  the  disciple  and interpreter  of  St.  Peter,"  and  adds  that  he wrote  his  Gospel  at  the  request  of  the  Roman Christians  under  the  direction  of  St.  Peter himself.  There  existed  even  a  tradition  that St.  Mark's  Gospel  was  originally  written  in Latin  rather  than  in  Greek.  It  seems  almost certain  that  he  is  the  disciple  whom  St.  Peter calls  "my  son  Mark  "  (1  Peter  v.  13).  Of  his after-history  we  know  that  he  was  sent  as  a missionary  probably  to  Aquileia,  whence  his connection  with  Venice,  but  certainly  to  Etjypt, where  he  founded  the  great  Church  of  Alexandria. It  was  there  that  St.  Mark  suffered  for Christ,  dying  in  prison  about  A.D.  68.  His body  was  in  the  ninth  century  translated  to Venice,  of  which  city  St.  Mark  Is  the  chief Patron  Saint.  In  art  he  is  represented  with  a lion  at  his  feet,  and  often  with  a  scroll  on  which are  inscribed  the  words  :  "  Peace  be  to  thee, O  Mark,  My  Evangelist." 
MARK  of  GALILEE  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  28)  
(1st  cent.)  A  native  of  Galilee  who  coming over  to  Italy  was  converted  and  baptised  by St.  Peter.  The  Apostle  sent  him  as  missionary and  Bishop  into  the  Province  of  the  Marsi (Abruzzi).  There  he  by  his  zeal  spread Christianity,  driving  thousands  to  Faith  in Christ,  and  there  in  the  end  he  suffered martyrdom  (A.D.  92).  

MARK  and  MARCELLIANUS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  18)

ties.  They  were  at  length  arrested,  but  at the  instance  of  their  wives  and  relatives  the execution  was  delayed  till  all  manner  of  persuasions had  been  vainly  employed  to  induce  them to  deny  Christ.  They  bravely  underwent  the most  appalling  tortures  before  being  beheaded (a.d.  286).  As  in  many  other  cases,  their heroism  led  to  the  conversion  of  numbers  of Pagans,  witnesses  of  their  constancy  in  the Faith. MARK,  MUCIANUS,  PAUL  and  ANOTHER 
(SS.)  MM.  (July  3)  
(Date  unknown.)  Greek  Martyrs,  as  would appear  from  the  Oriental  Menologies.  Mark and  Mucian  were  beheaded  like  so  many  other Christians  ;  but  what  has  helped  to  preserve their  memory  is  the  bravery  of  the  little  Christian boy  Paul,  who  persisted  in  crying  out  in the  Court  in  which  they  were  tried  that  he  too was  a  Christian.  The  judge  at  first  contented himself  with  ordering  the  child  to  be  whipped. But  the  boy  persisted  in  exclaiming  against idols  and  idolaters,  until  the  judge,  losing patience  with  him,  ordered  him  to  be  handed over  to  the  executioner  together  with  another among  those  present  who  kept  crying  shame  on the  proceedings.  No  clue  to  the  date  or  place of  this  martyrdom  has  so  far  been  discovered. MARK  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  31)

(17th  cent.)  Croatian  and  Hungarian  Jesuits who  bravely  upheld  the  Catholic  Faith  against its  Protestant  assailants  in  Hungary.  After torture  they  were  put  to  death,  Sept.  16,  a.d. 1619. MARK  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  27)  
(1st  cent.)  The  St;  Mark  commemorated  in the  Roman  Martyrology  on  Sept.  27  is  the John  Mark  of  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles  (xii.  12, etc.).  The  tradition  followed  makes  him  to have  been  Bishop  of  Byblos,  on  the  skirts  of Mount  Lebanon.  There  are  many  arguments both  for  and  against  his  identity  with  St.  Mark the  Evangelist.  Those  who  assert  it  aver  that his  Jewish  name  was  John,  superseded  by  the Roman  name  Marcus  or  Mark,  in  the  same way  as  Saul  of  Tarsus  became  known  in  the West  as  Paul.  On  the  whole  it  is  more  probable that  he  was  another  personage  altogether. *MARK  of  LUCERA  (St.)  Bp.  (June  14)  
(4th  cent.) A  saintly  Bishop  in  local  veneration in  the South  of  Italy.  He  died  about a.d.  328. MARK,  ALPHIUS,  ALEXANDER  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  Various  accounts  are  given  of these  ancient  witnesses  to  Christ.  They, however,  agree  in  describing  St.  Mark  as  a shepherd  of  Antioch  in  Pisidia  (Asia  Minor), who  by  the  miracles  he  worked  effected  the conversion  of  the  brothers,  Alphius,  Alexander and  Zozimus.  Again,  they  agree  that  they  had as  fellow-sufferers,  a  number  of  soldiers,  Nicon, Neon,  Heliodorus  and  some  thirty  besides. Some  Menologies  add  a  number  of  other  Christians of  both  sexes.  It  seems  clear  also  that they  were  victims  of  the  great  persecution under  Diocletian  (a.d.  303  about).  Some  say that  the  soldiers  were  those  of  the  guard  sent to  arrest  St.  Mark.  It  is  further  asserted  that St.  Alphius  and  his  brothers  were  makers  of the  instruments  of  torture  used  to  try  the constancy  of  the  Martyrs,  and  that  they  were startled  into  believing  in  Christ  by  seeing  the metal  they  had  fashioned,  though  quite  cold, melt  before  their  eyes.  Lastly,  it  is  alleged that  when  the  head  of  St.  Mark  was  brought  by order  of  the  judge  into  the  temple  of  Diana,  the idol  fell  shattered  to  the  ground,  and  that  this led  to  the  conversion  of  Nicon  and  the  other soldiers.  The  Roman  Martyrology  simply 
182 

states  that  these  Martyrs  suffered  in  various places  and  in  different  manners.

(4th  cent.)  Victims  of  the  great  persecution in  Egypt  about  a.d.  304,  when  its  horrors  were extended  to  the  Christian  laity  under  the Caesar  Maximin  Daza.  The  Registers  contain special  mention  of  the  two  brothers,  Mark  and Martian  ;  but  make  no  attempt  to  catalogue the  other  victims,  whom  they  describe  as innumerable  and  as  comprising  victims  of  all ages  and  of  both  sexes.  Hideous  tortures appear  to  have  preceded  the  execution  of  very many  of  these  Christians.  

MARK  (St.)  Pope.  (Oct.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  of  noble  birth  who succeeded  St.  Sylvester  on  the  Papal  throne (a.d.  336).  But  his  reign  lasted  only  a  few months.  He  died  Oct.  7,  A.D.  336.  Many centuries  afterwards  the  body  of  Pope  St.  Mark was  translated  to  the  church  (San  Marco)  in Rome,  which  he  himself  had  had  built  in  honour of  St.  Mark  the  Evangelist.  Pope  St.  Mark is  credited  by  some  authors  with  having  been the  first  to  confer  on  certain  Archbishops  the much-prized  ornament  known  as  the  Pallium. He  is  also  alleged  to  have  introduced  the  practice of  reciting  the  Nicene  Creed  at  Mass  on  Sundays and  festivals.  But  this  is  very  doubtful. Writing  some  years  after  his  death  the  epitaph of  St.  Mark,  Pope  St.  Damasus  insists  on  the simple-mindedness  and  love  of  prayer  which characterised  his  holy  predecessor.  

MARK  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  22)  
(2nd  cent.)  Eusebius  the  historian  describes this  Saint  as  the  first  Bishop  of  Jerusalem  who was  not  of  Jewish  extraction.  He  is  said  to have  governed  the  Church  of  Jerusalem,  at that  time  dispersed,  for  some  twenty  years, and  to  have  died  by  martyrdom  under  the Antonines,  perhaps  about  A.D.  156.  Both  the Greek  and  the  Roman  Martyrologies  style  him a  Martyr  ;  but  Eusebius  is  silent  about  this, nor  have  we  any  other  historical  proof  that  he did  not  die  a  natural  death.  The  length  of  his Episcopate  is  also  a  matter  of  conjecture.

(7th  cent.)  A  Scottish  Saint,  one  of  the Apostles  of  Northumbria.  He  died  in  Annandale,  a.d.  620,  and  was  much  venerated  in  the borderland  between  England  and  Scotland.  

♦MARNOC  (MARNAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  1)  
(7th  cent.)  The  Saint  who  has  given  his name  to  Kilmarnock  in  Scotland.  He  was  a disciple  of  St.  Columba  at  Iona,  and  afterwards a  missionary  Bishop.  Possibly  he  is  one  and the  same  with  St.  Marnoc  of  Annandale.  

♦MARNOCK  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  25)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Saint  venerated  in  Annandale. He  is  said  to  have  been  a  disciple  of  St.  Brendan, and  was  anciently  liturgically  honoured  in  Scotland. Particulars  concerning  him  are  lacking.  

♦MARO  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  14)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Syrian  hermit  renowned  in the  East  for  his  zeal  for  religion  and  for  the austerity  of  his  life.  Both  St.  Chrysostom  and Theodoret  make  reverent  mention  of  his  virtues. He  died  a.d.  433.  It  is  probably  from  him  that the  Catholic  Cliristians  known  as  Maronites take  their  name. 
MARTIN 

MARO  (St.)  M.  (April  15)  
(1st  cent.)  Together  with  SS.  Eutyches  and Victorinus,  he  shared  the  exile  of  the  famous Roman  lady,  Flavia  Domitilla,  in  the  Mediterranean Island  of  Ponza.  Recalled  to  Rome under  the  Emperor  Nerva,  the  three  Saints were  ordained  priests  and  became  zealous preachers  of  Christianity.  Under  Trajan  they were  arrested  and  condemned  to  death  as Christians.  Eutyches  was  stabbed,  Victorinus was  hung  head  downwards  over  a  sulphur spring,  and  Maro  was  beheaded  (A.D.  99, about).  

MAROLUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  23)  
(5th  cent.)  He  governed  the  important  See of  Milan  for  fifteen  years  (A.D.  408-a.d.  423). A  poem  by  Ennodius  celebrates  his  merits  and virtues,  to  which  many  miracles  bore  witness. St.  Charles  Borromeo  made  a  solemn  Translation of  his  relics  (a.d.  1574).

MARTHA  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  23)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Spanish  maiden,  one  of  the victims  of  the  persecution  under  Decius  (a.d. 250).  Every  artifice  was  employed  to  seduce her  from  the  Faith  ;  but  all  efforts  being  in vain,  she  was  put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded. Her  relics  are  enshrined  in  the  Cathedral  of Astorga.  

MARTHA  (St.)  V.  (July  29)  
(1st  cent.)  The  sister  of  St.  Lazarus  and  of St.  Mary  Magdalen,  and  the  hostess  of  Our Lord  in  their  house  at  Bethany  (Luke  x. ; John  xi.  xii.).  She  is  believed  to  have  been one  of  the  holy  women  who  attended  Christ in  His  Passion,  and  who  rejoiced  with  Him after  His  Resurrection.  Tradition  also  has  it that,  with  her  brother  and  sister,  she  crossed the  sea  to  Marseilles  and  aided  in  the  introducing of  Christianity  into  Gaul.  A  popular  legend ascribes  to  St.  Martha  the  destruction  of  a dragon,  said  to  have  been  the  terror  of  the people  of  Tarrascon  in  Provence,  where  she fixed  her  abode  and  passed  her  days  in  the practice  of  virtues,  especially  of  those  by  which she  could  benefit  her  neighbour.  Many  miracles are  recorded  as  wrought  in  answer  to  her prayers.  She  is  said  to  have  died  eight  days after  her  holy  sister,  St.  Magdalen  (July  29, a.d.  84).  Artists  usually  represent  St.  Martha as  overcoming  or  perhaps  taming  a  dragon (emblem  of  Paganism).  

MARTHA,  SAULA  and  OTHERS  (Oct.  20)

(5th  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Cologne  of  the  number of  those  who  with  St.  Ursula  suffered  death at  the  hands  of  the  Huns  in  the  middle  of  the fifth  century.  Some  authors  consider  the  name Saula  to  be  only  a  variant  of  Ursula.  

MARTIA  (St.)  M.  (June  21)  

See  SS.  RUFINUS  and  MARTIA.  

MARTIAL  (St.)  Bp.  (June  30)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  first  Bishop  of Limoges,  and,  according  to  St.  Gregory  of Tours,  one  of  the  seven  missionary  bishops sent  from  Rome  to  preach  the  Gospel  in  Gaul in  the  middle  of  the  third  century.  His  field of  work  was  the  country  round  Limoges,  where his  memory  is  held  in  great  veneration.  A life  of  St.  Martial  by  Bishop  Aurelian,  his successor,  is  now  regarded  as  spurious  ;  but from  the  account  it  gives  has  arisen  the  popular belief  that  St.  Martial  was  sent  to  Gaul  by St.  Peter  himself,  that  he  had  been  one  of  the seventy-two  disciples  chosen  as  missionaries by  Our  Lord,  that  he  waited  on  Christ  and His  Apostles  at  the  Last  Supper,  &c.

(3rd  cent.)  They  are  known  as  the  "  Pilgrim Martyrs,"  and  were  done  to  death  as  Christians at  Porto  near  Rome,  either  when  on  their  way to  Rome  to  visit  the  shrines  of  the  Apostles or  on  their  return  journey.  There  were  others in  their  company,  and  all  shared  their  fate and  their  triumph.  The  precise  date  of  their Passion  is  no  longer  ascertainable. MARTIAL,  LAURENCE  and  OTHERS  (Sept,  28)

See  SARAGOSSA  (MARTYRS  of). MARTIN  of  TONGRES  (St.)  Bp.  (June  21)  
(3rd  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  the  seventh Bishop  of  Tongres,  and  regarded  as  the  Apostle of  that  part  of  Belgium  which  in  his  time (end  of  the  third  century)  was  still  steeped  in idolatry.  He  appears  to  have  been  a  hermit until  he  was  compelled  by  the  people  of  Tongres to  become  their  Bishop.  He  was  in  his  lifetime in  great  fame  on  account  of  his  sanctity  and the  gift  of  working  miracles,  with  which  he  was endued.  After  his  holy  death  (a.d.  276)  many extraordinary  cures  took  place  at  his  tomb. St.  Servatius  translated  his  relics  to  Maestricht (A.D.  384). MARTIN  of  VIENNE  (St.)  Bp.  (July  1)  
(2nd  cent.)  According  to  tradition,  the third  Bishop  of  Vienne  in  Gaul.  He  is  alleged to  have  been  sent  as  a  missionary  into  Gaul by  Pope  St.  Alexander  (a.d.  121-132).  Some writers  say  that  this  Martial  was  an  eye-witness of  the  Crucifixion  of  Our  Lord,  and  that  he  was a  disciple  of  the  Apostles.  The  former  statement is  not  probable,  but  there  may  be  some ground  for  the  latter  assertion. MARTIN  of  TREVES  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (July  19)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Roman  Martyrology  styles this  holy  Bishop  a  Martyr,  and  there  has always  been  a  tradition  that  when  the  Emperor Septimus  Severus  (a.d.  193-211)  was  laying waste  the  churches  and  putting  Christians to  death,  among  the  many  Bishops  who  laid down  their  lives  for  the  Faith  was  a  Martin, Bishop  of  Treves.  We  have,  however,  no certain  record  of  his  martyrdom.  The  records at  Treves  give  him  as  the  tenth  Bishop  of  that See,  and  state  that  he  was  appointed  to  it  at  a time  of  great  danger,  and  that  he  passed  away about  A.d.  210. MARTIN  (St.)  (Oct.  24)  

Otherwise  St.  MARCIUS,  which  see. MARTIN  of  VERTOU  (St.)  Abbot.  (Oct.  24)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Frank  of  great  virtue  and distinguished  by  his  learning  and  talent. Ordained  priest  by  St.  Felix,  Bishop  of  Nantes, he  passed  some  years  engaged  in  missionary work.  He  then  founded  and  became  first Abbot  of  the  monastery  of  Vertou,  subsequently founding  other  monasteries.  He  died  at  the age  of  seventy-four,  a.d.  601.  Many  churches, especially  in  Poitou,  bear  his  name. MARTIN  of  TOURS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  We  have  ancient  lives  of  this great  Saint,  who  is  among  the  best  known  and most  popular  of  those  in  honour  in  the  early Middle  Ages,  from  the  pens  of  Sulpicius  Severus and  of  St.  Gregory,  one  of  his  successors  at Tours.  He  was  born  in  Hungary,  educated at  Pavia  in  Italy,  and  at  the  age  of  fifteen enrolled  in  the  Imperial  cavalry.  Very  famous are  his  act  of  charity  in  sharing  his  military cloak  with  a  poor  beggar  at  the  gates  of  Amiens and  the  subsequent  heavenly  vision  which  led to  his  Baptism.  After  five  years  of  service  in the  army  he  revisited  his  native  Hungary  and brought  about  the  conversion  to  Christianity

MARTIN 
of  his  own  mother.  Returning  to  France,  he placed  himself  in  the  hands  of  St.  Hilary, Bishop  of  Poitiers.  There  he  built  a  monastery, and  eleven  years  later  was  chosen  Bishop  of Tours  (A.D.  371).  Though  henceforth  engaged in  spreading  the  Gospel  by  his  zealous  labours and  by  his  example  of  virtues,  as  well  as  by the  exercise  of  his  gifts  of  prophecy  and  miracleworking,  he  endeavoured  to  the  end  to  observe monastic  discipline,  retiring  at  intervals  to  the neighbouring  great  Abbey  of  Marmoutier.  He died  Nov.  11,  A.D.  397.  Many  churches  and towns  throughout  Western  Europe  have  been placed  under  his  Patronage.  

MARTIN  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Nov.  12)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Tuscan  who,  after  a  brilliant course  of  studies  in  the  schools  of  his  time, decided  to  dedicate  himself  and  his  exceptional gifts  to  the  service  of  the  Altar,  wherein  his ability  and  sanctity  raised  him  by  degrees  to the  Chair  of  St.  Peter  (A.D.  649).  He  was distinguished  for  his  love  of  the  poor  and  other pastoral  virtues,  but  perhaps  yet  more  for  his zealous  guardianship  of  the  deposit  of  the Faith.  In  its  defence  he  underwent  many years  of  living  martyrdom.  His  hardest struggle  was  against  the  Monothelite  heretics patronised  by  the  Greek  Emperor  Constans  II. He  condemned  them  formally  in  a  Council  of many  Bishops  held  in  the  Lateran  at  Rome (A.D.  649).  After  this,  his  life  was  attempted more  than  once.  He  was  next  seized  and deported  to  the  Isle  of  Naxos  in  the  iEgean Sea,  where  he  passed  a  whole  year  in  sickness and  sore  privation.  Finally,  he  was  brought  to Constantinople,  imprisoned  there,  and  subjected to  every  sort  of  ignominy.  He  died  in  exile in  the  Crimea  (A.D.  655).  His  body  was  afterwards translated  to  Rome,  and  is  enshrined  in the  Church  which  bears  his  name.  

MARTIN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Dec.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Martin  of  Tours and  Founder  of  an  Abbey  near  Saintes.  The historian  St.  Gregory  of  Tours  celebrates  the virtues  which  distinguished  his  holy  life,  and the  many  miracles  by  which  it  pleased  Almighty God  to  bear  testimony  to  his  sanctity.  

MARTINA  (St.)  V.M.  (Jan.  1)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  maiden  arrested  as  a Christian  while  at  prayer,  some  time,  it  would appear,  dining  the  reign  of  Alexander  Severus, put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded.  Ostia,  at the  mouth  of  the  Tiber,  was  the  scene  of  her martyrdom ;  but  her  body  was  translated to  Rome,  where  a  noble  church  is  dedicated  in her  honour.  There  she  is  an  object  of  great popular  veneration,  and  she  is  commemorated annually  in  the  Liturgy  of  the  Universal  Church.  

MARTINIAN  (MATERNIAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  2) (5th  cent.)  The  seventeenth  Bishop  of Milan,  to  which  See  he  was  raised  A.D.  423. He  took  part  in  the  Council  of  Ephesus,  and wrote  an  able  book  against  the  errors  of  Nestorius.  He  died  A.D.  432,  or,  according  to others,  A.D.  435,  and  was  buried  in  the  Church of  St.  Stephen  at  Milan.

MARTINIAN,  SATURIANUS  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  16)  
(5th  cent.)  African  Christians,  victims  of the  persecuting  fury  of  the  Arian  Genseric, King  of  the  Vandals.  Like  others,  they  had been  reduced  to  slavery  by  the  Barbarians, who  overran  the  Roman  Province  of  Africa. This  misfortune,  however,  had  led  to  many conversions  to  Christianity,  mainly  through  the zeal  of  a  slave  woman,  by  name  Maxima. Besides  Martinian  and  Saturianus,  there  were 
184 

other  two,  their  own  brothers,  slaves  like  themselves, converted  with  them  to  Catholic  Christianity. They  did  their  best  to  get  other converts,  and  so  drew  down  upon  themselves the  wrath  of  the  pitiless  Genseric.  They  were done  to  death  by  being  fastened  by  ropes behind  a  chariot  and  dragged  along  till  they expired  from  bruises  and  exhaustion.  A.D.  450 or  thereabouts  is  suggested  as  the  date  of  their martyrdom.  On  this  same  day  (Oct.  16)  the Roman  Martyrology  commemorates  two  other groups  of  African  Christians,  one  in  number two  hundred  and  seventy,  the  other  three hundred  and  sixty-seven — victims  of  the  same persecution ;  but  records  are  scanty,  details wanting,  and  the  questions  that  arise,  perplexing. MARTYRIUS  (MARTORY)  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  23)  
(6th  cent.)  A  monk  or  Solitary  who  lived  in the  Province  of  Valeria  (Abruzzi)  in  the  South of  Italy,  whom  St.  Gregory  the  Great  extols as  a  great  servant  of  God,  and  of  whom  he relates  the  miracles  wrought  at  his  prayer. MARTYRIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  29)  

See  SS.  SISINNIUS,  MARTYRIUS, &c. MARTYRIUS  and  MARCIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  25)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Martyrius  was  a  Subdeacon, and  St.  Marcian  a  Cantor  or  Reader  in  the Church  of  Constantinople  in  the  time  of  the persecuted  Patriarch  St.  Paul.  They  were  put to  death  by  the  authorities  at  the  instigation of  the  Arian  usurper  of  the  Patriarchate, Macedonius  (A.D.  351),  on  a  trumped-up  charge of  sedition.  The  historian  Sozomen  relates how  they  were  later  given  honourable  burial, and  how  St.  Chrysostom  erected  a  church  over their  tomb.

See  CARTHUSIAN  MARTYRS. *MARTYRS  (ENGLISH).  (May  4)  

See  ENGLAND  (MARTYRS  of). MARUTHAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  4)  
(4th  cent.)  This  holy  man  flourished  in Mesopotamia  towards  the  end  of  the  fourth century.  His  contemporaries  are  unanimous  in their  praise  of  his  learning,  virtues  and  miracles. Syrian  chroniclers  style  him  Bishop  of  Tigrit. He  attended  the  Council  of  Constantinople against  Macedonius  (A.D.  380),  and  made  various other  journeys  to  the  Imperial  Capital  to implore  the  intervention  of  the  Emperors Arcadius  and  Theodosius  the  Younger  between King  Isdegerdes  of  Persia  and  his  persecuted Christian  subjects.  St.  Chrysostom  pays  a great  tribute  of  praise  to  St.  Maruthas  for  his zeal  in  the  cause  of  the  afflicted  Church  of Persia.  The  Saint  at  length  gained  the  Royal favour,  and  thus  was  enabled  to  build  and repair  churches,  to  restore  ecclesiastical  discipline and  even  to  convoke  Synods  at  Ctesiphon. The  concluding  of  a  Peace  between  Constantinople and  Persia  at  that  difficult  period  is  due to  his  tact  and  energy.  In  his  Episcopal  city of  Tigrit,  he  collected  the  scattered  relics  of Persian  Martyrs  and  enshrined  there  so  many that  it  gained  the  name  of  Martyropolis  (City of  Martyrs).  The  body  of  St.  Maruthas  was soon  placed  among  and  shared  the  honour paid  to  them.  Later  it  was  translated  to Egypt.  St.  Maruthas  has  written  many valuable  works  in  the  Syriac  language,  among them  a  Liturgy,  a  Commentary  on  the  Gospels, and  some  account  of  his  own  times.  

MARY  (THE  BLESSED  VIRGIN).  

MOTHER  OF  GOD.  (Aug.  15)  
(1st  cent.)  The  Virgin  Mother  of  God  is venerated  with  special  worship  by  the  Catholic Church  as  the  highest  of  God's  creatures,  as the  woman  who  was  to  crush  the  head  of  the old  serpent  (Gen.  ii.  15),  and  as  the  Queen  of All  Saints.  It  is  a  dogma  of  Faith  that  she was  conceived  free  from  the  taint  of  original sin,  through  the  grace  to  be  merited  for  her by  her  future  Son  and  Saviour.  In  early  ages 
MARY 

many  legends  were  current  concerning  her  birth and  childhood.  The  Church  accepts  the tradition  that  her  parents  were  two  Saints, Joachim  and  Anne,  and  that,  when  very young,  she  was  presented  to  God  in  the  Temple of  Jerusalem,  where  she  passed  several  years  in its  service,  and  whence  in  line  she  was  taken  to be  espoused  to  Joseph,  the  carpenter  of  Nazareth. The  Gospels  relate  the  events  of  her  sinless life  connected  with  the  Incarnation,  Birth  and early  years  of  Her  Divine  Son ;  and  they commemorate  her  faithfulness  to  Him  in  the hour  of  His  Passion  and  Death.  Dying,  He commended  her  to  the  care  of  John,  His  Beloved disciple.  The  number  of  years  she  survived is  not  known.  They  were  probably  passed  in Jerusalem  or  in  its  neighbourhood.  A  Greek belief  also  claims  for  Ephesus  the  honour  of  a prolonged  sojourn  of  Our  Blessed  Lady  within its  walls.  The  Assumption  (Aug.  15)  is  the Festival  instituted  by  Holy  Church  to  celebrate Mary's  passing  from  this  world  to  be  enthroned next  to  Her  Divine  Son  in  Heaven ;  and Catholics  hold  that  among  the  privileges vouchsafed  her  was  that  of  the  raising  of  her body  to  life  eternal  at  the  time  of  the  entry  of her  pure  soul  into  God's  everlasting  Kingdom. Besides  the  Assumption,  other  Feasts  are  kept annually  in  honour  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  Mary. Chief  among  them  are :  Her  Immaculate Conception  (Dec.  8) ;  Her  Nativity  (Sept.  8) ; Her  Presentation  in  the  Temple  (Nov.  21) ; The  Annunciation  (March  25) ;  The  Visitation (July  2) ;  The  Purification  (Feb.  2) ;  and  Her Seven  Sorrows  (Sept.  15).  But  invocation  of Mary  pervades  all  Catholic  devotion,  public and  private,  and  there  is  no  Christian  worthy of  the  name  but  constantly  implores  her  help and  prayers.  

MARY  of  EGYPT  (St.)  (April  2)  
(5th  cent.)  It  was  the  custom  in  the  East to  read  over  publicly  during  the  Divine  Office the  Life  of  this  holy  penitent.  The  fact  of  her career  of  infamy  at  Alexandria,  followed  by  her conversion  at  the  threshold  of  the  Holy  Sepulchre at  Jerusalem,  and  her  subsequent  retreat  into the  desert  for  a  lifelong  penance,  were  familiar to  every  Greek  Christian.  In  her  solitude  she was  at  length  discovered  by  the  priest  Zozimus, who  prepared  her  for  death.  She  is  supposed to  have  passed  away  about  a.d.  421,  and  her relics  were  shared  among  many  principal churches  both  in  the  East  and  in  the  West. Some  authors  date  St.  Mary  of  Egypt  a  century later  ;  but  though  the  Greek  legend  cannot be  fully  trusted,  the  arguments  in  favour  of the  date  it  gives  seem  to  preponderate.  

MARY  CLEOPHAS  (St.)  (April  9)  
(First  cent.)  One  of  the  "  Three  Marys  " who  followed  Our  Lord  from  Galilee  and  who stood  at  the  Foot  of  the  Cross  on  Calvary. She  was  the  wife  of  Cleophas  or  Alpheus  (John xix.  25),  and  the  mother  of  the  Apostle  St. James  the  Less.  Some  think  that  she  was  a sister  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  Mary,  to  whom  she was  certainly  very  nearly  related.  There  are certain  legends  purporting  to  give  an  account  of her  after-life ;  but  they  are  not  sufficiently well-grounded  to  be  of  use.  

♦MARY  OF  THE  INCARNATION  (April  18)  
(BI.)  Widow.  

(17th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  the  wife  of  a Government  official  (M.  Acarie),  a  woman  of exceeding  piety.  She  introduced  St.  Teresa's Carmelites  into  France,  and  after  her  husband's death,  herself  entered  the  Order.  She  passed away  in  the  convent  at  Pontoise,  a.d.  1618,  and was  beatified  by  Pope  Pius  VI  (a.d.  1791).  

MARY  MAGDALEN  DEI  PAZZI  (St.)  V.  (May  25) (17th  cent.)  Born  a.d.  1566,  from  her  childhood she  gave  evident  signs  of  sanctity  to  come, and  in  her  sixteenth  year  entered  the  Carmelite Convent  of  Florence.  In  spite  of  weak  health, she  practised,  all  her  life  long,  every  sort  of self-denial ; and  her  wonderful  humility  and 

patience,  especially  during  long  periods  of spiritual  desolation,  drew  her  ever  nearer  to  the Foot  of  Christ's  Cross.  She  was  tenderly devoted  to  the  worship  of  Our  Lord  in  the Blessed  Sacrament,  and  from  time  to  time enjoyed  heavenly  consolations  reaching  the mysterious  state  of  ecstasy,  particularly  after having  received  Holy  Communion.  Her  death, preceded  by  three  years  of  intense  bodily suffering,  occurred  May  25,  A.D.  1607.  

MARY  (St.)  Widow.  (June  29)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  New  Testament Saints,  wherein  she  is  mentioned  (Acts  xii.  12) as  the  mother  of  John,  surnamed  Mark.  From the  text  it  results  that  Mary's  house  was  a  place of  assembly  for  the  Apostles  and  other  Christians. There  is  even  a  tradition  that  it  was  the  scene of  the  Last  Supper  and  of  the  Descent  of  the Holy  Ghost.  It  was,  it  is  said,  later  changed into  a  church.  Scripture  tells  us  nothing  more about  this  St.  Mary ;  but  there  exist  some traditions  alleging  that  she  died  either  at Alexandria  in  Egypt  or  in  the  Island  of  Cyprus. These  arose  from  the  relationship,  real  or  supposed, of  this  St.  Mary  to  St.  Mark  the  Evangelist, as  well  as  to  St.  Barnabas,  the  one  and the  other  connected  with  Egypt  and  with Cyprus.  We  know  (Coloss.  iv.  10)  that  Mark and  Barnabas  were  cousins  ;  but  this  Mark, the  son  of  the  St.  Mary  of  June  29,  was  almost certainly  other  than  the  Evangelist.  

♦MARY  of  OIGNIES  (St.)  Widow.  (June  23)  
(13th  cent.)  A  holy  woman  of  Nivelles  in Brabant  who,  during  a  long  widowhood,  led  a life  of  supernatural  prayer  at  Oignies,  in  the neighbourhood  of  her  birthplace,  and  was  the means  of  converting  many  souls  to  God.  She died  a.d.  1213,  and  was  at  once  popularly venerated  as  a  Saint.  

MARY  MAGDALEN  (St.)  Penitent.  (July  22)  
(1st  cent.)  Several  passages  in  the  Gospels tell  us  all  that  we  know  for  certain  of  this wonderful  Saint,  at  one  time  a  sinner  "  possessed by  seven  devils."  According  to  the Catholic  view  expressed  by  the  Church  in  her Liturgy,  St.  Mary  Magdalen  is  one  and  the same  with  Mary  the  Sinner,  Mary  of  Bethany, the  sister  of  Lazarus  and  Martha,  the  Magdalen at  the  Foot  of  the  Cross  and  at  the  Tomb, and  the  first  witness  to  the  Resurrection.  The Greek  tradition  is  that  St.  Magdalen  afterwards retired  to  Ephesus  with  the  Blessed  Virgin  and St.  John.  But  Western  belief  is  to  the  effect that,  in  company  with  Martha  and  Lazarus, she  crossed  the  Sea  to  Marseilles  and  aided them  in  the  work  of  announcing  Christ  to  the people  of  Provence.  The  gloomy  cavern  known as  the  Sainte-Baume,  a  great  resort  of  pilgrims, is  held  to  have  been  inhabited  by  her  during the  closing  years  of  her  life,  and  to  have  been the  scene  of  her  death.  It  is  situated  on  a  hill near  the  little  town  of  St.  Maxime,  and  is  now of  comparatively  easy  access.  

MARY  DE  SOCOS  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  19)  
(13th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  born  in answer  to  the  prayers  of  St.  Peter  Nolasco, whom  her  childless  parents  had  approached  in their  disappointment.  These  same  parents were  great  benefactors  of  the  then  new  Order of  Mercy  or  of  Ransom  of  Captives,  so  that when  a  Third  branch  of  the  same  Order  was founded  for  women  by  two  pious  widows,  their already  saintly  daughter  Mary  joined  the community,  and  in  time  became  its  Superior. So  great  was  the  charity  and  helpfulness  to  all of  the  Saint,  that  her  family  name  of  Cervellon was  lost  in  her  popular  appellation  of  Maria  de Socos  (Mary  of  Help).  She  died  a.d.  1290,  and was  buried  in  the  church  of  her  Order  in  Barcelona, where  her  tomb  was  the  scene  of  many

(18th  cent.)  Fifteen  French  nuns  (Sisters  of

Charity,  Ursulines  and  Bridgettines)  guillotined at  Cambrai  during  the  Great  Revolution. Their  persistent  refusal  to  cast  off  their  Religious habit  earned  for  them  many  months  of  imprisonment and  finally  the  death-sentence.  They, mounting  one  by  one  the  scaffold,  sang  the Thanksgiving  Hymn,  Te  Deum.  They  were beatified  by  Pope  Benedict  XV  (A.D.  1920).  

MARY  SALOME  (St.)  (Oct.  22)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  "  Three  Marys." She  was  the  wife  of  Zebedee  and  the  mother  of the  two  Apostles,  St.  James  the  Greater  and St.  John  the  Evangelist.  She  was  one  of  the holy  women  who  followed  and  ministered  to  Our Lord  at  His  Crucifixion  and  Burial,  and  who were  witnesses  to  His  Resurrection.  Tradition brings  her  afterwards  to  the  South  of  Gaul, and  points  to  her  tomb  in  an  island  at  the mouth  of  the  Rhone.  Her  relics,  concealed during  the  dangers  of  the  great  Revolution, have  been  replaced  in  her  church  there.

See  SS.  FLORA  and  MARY.  

MARY  (St.)  V.M.  (Nov.  1)  
(2nd  cent.)  During  the  reign  of  the  Roman Emperor  Hadrian,  a  certain  Senator  discovered that  one  of  his  slaves,  by  name  Mary,  refused at  a  festival  to  partake  of  viands  which  had been  consecrated  to  the  gods  of  Rome.  He imprisoned  her,  but,  being  accused  of  harbouring a  Christian,  delivered  her  over  to  the  populace, who  were  clamouring  for  her  death.  Yet  these same  people,  witnessing  her  patient  endurance of  torture,  induced  her  judges  to  remand  her to  prison.  There  she  expired  from  the  effects of  her  wounds  (a.d.  120).

MASCULAS  ARCHIMIMUS  (St.)  (March  29)  

See  SS.  ARMOGASTES,  &c. (In  regard  to  this  Saint,  it  is  very  probable that  there  is  an  error  in  the  common  reading  of the  entry  in  the  Roman  Martyrology.  This runs :  In  Africa,  the  Holy  Confessors,  Armogastes,  a  Count,  Masculas,  Archimimus  (which may  mean  Chief  or  President  of  the  Theatrical Company)  and  Saturus,  Procurator  of  the  Royal Household,  &c,  &c.  The  reading  now  suggested is :  Armogastes,  a  Count,  the  Superintendent of  the  Theatre  at  Mascula,  and Saturus.  Or  again :  The  Superintendent  of the  Theatre,  a  native  of  Mascula.  Nor,  even in  such  case,  is  it  clear  whether  it  is  Armogastes who  is  noted  as  Chief  of  the  Company  of  Actors or  whether  another  person,  unnamed,  is  described as  such.  It  is  contrary  to  the  custom  of  these Registers  to  omit  mention  of  the  name  of  a  Saint where  it  was  ascertainable.  But  on  the  other hand,  one  scarcely  conceives  a  Roman  "  Comes  " having  to  be  described  as  a  Theatre  Manager or  as  Chief  of  the  Actors.)  

MASSA  CANDIDA  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  24)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  name  "  Massa  Candida  " ( White  Mass)  denotes  a  group  of  three  hundred Christians  who  suffered  martyrdom  at  Utica  in North  Africa  in  the  persecution  decreed  by  the Emperors  Gallienus  and  Valerian  (a.d.  254a.d.  268).  Ordered  to  choose  between  sacrificing to  idols  and  being  cast  into  a  lime-kiln, they  elected  at  once  to  die  for  Christ.  Their remains  (sought  as  relics)  were  of  course  undistinguishable  from  the  lime  that  had  burned them  up.

MATERNUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  18)  
(4th  cent.)  This  holy  Bishop  of  Milan occupies  a  prominent  place  in  the  Ambrosian Liturgy.  The  local  records  tell  us  how  he was  elected  by  acclamation,  both  clergy  and people  insisting  on  having  him  for  their  Pastor  ; how  he  was  beloved  even  by  the  Pagans ; how  he  encouraged  and  comforted  his  flock during  the  persecution  under  Diocletian ;  and how  he  himself  set  them  an  example  of  patience 186 

and  fortitude  in  times  of  trial  and  calamity, especially  when  he  was  singled  out  as  the special  object  of  the  fury  of  the  persecutors. Enfeebled  by  torture  and  other  suffering,  he died  in  the  first  years  of  the  fourth  century, while  Maximian  Herculeus  was  still  bent  on carrying  out  Diocletian's  policy  of  extirpating Christianity.  

MATERNUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  14)  
(Date  uncertain.)  According  to  Baronius  and the  Roman  Martyrology,  St.  Maternus  received his  mission  to  Gaul  from  St.  Peter  in  person. But  the  Bollandists  and  others  post-date  his Episcopate  to  the  fourth  century.  He  was  the first  Apostle  of  Alsace,  and  successfully  promoted the  spread  of  Christianity  in  that  Province  and in  Western  Germany.  The  formerly  accepted tradition  makes  him  one  of  the  seventy-two disciples  chosen  by  Our  Lord  (Luke  x.  1) ; and  some  mediaeval  writers  insist  that  he  was the  son  of  the  widow  of  Nairn  whom  Our  Lord raised  from  the  dead.  That  at  least  he  lived  in Apostolic  times  finds  some  confirmation  in  the fact  of  the  extent  to  which  Alsace  had  been converted  as  early  as  the  second  century.

MATHURIN  (St.)  (Nov.  1)  
(4th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  said  to  have been  born  of  Pagan  parents  whom  he  himself afterwards  converted  to  Christianity.  He attributed  his  own  conversion  to  the  zeal  of Polycarp,  Bishop  of  Sens.  Ordained  priest, he  became  a  fervent  and  successful  preacher, and  his  merits  and  talents  led  eventually  to  his being  called  to  continue  his  work  in  Rome. He  died  there  a.d.  388.  His  remains  were later  taken  back  to  France,  and  his  shrine  until the  Revolution  of  the  end  of  the  eighteenth century  was  a  popular  place  of  pilgrimage.  

MATILDA  (MATHILDIS,  MAUDE)  (March  14) (St.)  Queen.  

(10th  cent.)  A  Saxon  lady  of  high  birth  who was  married  to  Henry  the  Fowler,  Emperor  of Germany.  In  her  high  position  she  displayed the  most  exalted  virtue,  and  was  distinguished for  her  compassionate  care  of  the  poor,  for  her efforts  to  secure  the  education  of  children,  and for  her  zeal  in  the  erection  and  adornment of  churches.  In  her  widowhood  she  had  to suffer  much  at  the  hands  of  her  sons,  Otho and  Henry,  by  whom  she  was  despoiled  of  most of  her  possessions.  She  died  at  the  Abbey  of Quedlinburg  (a.d.  968),  and  was  buried  by  the side  of  her  husband.  

MATRONA  (St.)  M.  (March  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Christian  serving-maid  or slave  of  a  Jewess  at  Thessalonica  in  Greece. Her  mistress  discovering  that  she  was  a  Christian, denounced  her  to  the  authorities.  It  was at  the  outset  of  the  persecution  under  Diocletian, and  little  mercy  was  inspired  by  the  youth  or sex  of  the  offender.  Matrona  underwent  the scourging  which  was  the  usual  preliminary  to execution,  but  died  in  prison  from  its  effects.

MATRONIANUS  (St.)  (Dec.  14)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  native  of  Milan  who, after  spending  his  youth  in  the  conscientious discharge  of  his  public  duties  as  a  citizen,  and in  the  practice  of  his  religion,  was  inspired  by Almighty  God  to  lead  the  life  of  a  hermit.  The tradition  is  that  he  was  led  by  an  Angel  to  a place  of  utter  solitude,  and  that  the  same Angel  daily  brought  him  food  and,  when  his death  approached,  administered  to  him  the Holy  Viaticum.  His  body  is  said  to  have been  accidentally  discovered  by  a  hunter  and brought  to  Milan,  where  it  was  enshrined  by St.  Ambrose.  

♦MATTHEW  of  BEAUVAIS  (St.)  M.  (March  27) (11th  cent.) A  citizen  of  Beauvais  who  took

part  in  the  First  Crusade.  Made  prisoner  by the  Saracens,  he  rightly  preferred  to  die  rather than  to  renounce  Christ.  He  was  beheaded a.d.  1100,  or  perhaps  a  year  or  two  earlier. MATTHEW  (St.)  Apostle  and  Evangelist.  (Sept.  21) (1st  cent.)  He  was  also  called  Levi,  and  was the  son  of  Alphseus  (Mark  i.  14).  Holy Scripture  also  tells  us  that  Matthew  before  his conversion  was  a  tax-gatherer  at  Capharnaum. Other  special  mention  is  not  made  of  him  in the  New  Testament.  His  subsequent  career is  uncertain,  and  in  part  legendary.  St. Irenseus  says  that  he  preached  the  Gospel among  the  Hebrews,  and  Clement  of  Alexandria states  that  this  mission  lasted  fifteen  years. Other  ancient  writers  make  Persia,  Syria, Greece,  &c,  the  fields  of  St.  Matthew's  labours. But  the  most  accredited  opinion  is  to  the  effect that  he  was  the  Apostle  of  Ethiopia,  and accounts  of  his  martyrdom  in  Africa  are  extant. His  shrine  is  at  Salerno  in  Southern  Italy, whither  his  relics  were  translated  in  the  tenth century.  St.  Matthew  is  usually  represented in  art  with  the  Book  of  his  Gospel  before  him and  with  an  Angel  ministering  to  him. MATTHEW  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  12)  

See  SS.  BENEDICT,  JOHN, &c. MATTHIAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  30)  

One  of  the  early  Bishops  of  Jerusalem.  He flourished  about  a.d.  120,  at  a  time  when  his flock  was  in  great  part  dispersed.  He  underwent much  persecution  under  the  two  Emperors Trajan  and  Hadrian,  but  was  allowed  to  end his  days  in  peace. MATTHIAS  (St.)  Apostle.  (Feb.  21)  
(1st  cent.)  St.  Matthias  was  one  of  the  first disciples  of  Christ,  and  had  been  with  Him from  the  time  of  His  Baptism  to  His  last  days in  Jerusalem  (Acts  i.  21,  22).  He  was  chosen by  lot  by  the  Eleven  to  take  the  place  of  the traitor  Judas.  What  further  information tradition  supplies  as  to  his  after-life  and  ministry is  not  always  consistent.  Some  writers  suppose him  to  have  preached  the  Gospel  in  Judaea and  afterwards  in  Ethiopia,  and  to  have  met his  end  by  crucifixion.  Others  assert  that  he was  stoned  to  death  by  the  Jews  in  Jerusalem. MATURUS  (St.)  M.  (June  2)

(9th  cent.) A  young  maiden  of  Troyes  in Champagne,  who  died  at  the  age  of  twentythree  (a.d.  850)  after  a  life  spent  in  prayer  and in  the  doing  of  good  works.  

MAURA  (St.)  V.M.  (Nov.  30)  
(Date  unknown.)  Commemorated  at  Constantinople, where  she  met  her  death.  One  of the  Ionian  Islands  is  named  after  her.  Her popularity  as  a  Saint  in  the  East  seems  to  have been  very  great  indeed ;  so  much  so  that, powerless  to  eradicate  the  veneration  in  which she  was  held,  Julian  the  Apostate  proclaimed her  cult  to  be  no  other  than  of  the  heathen goddess Aphrodite (Venus), disgui?ed as a Christian  Saint.  The  date  and  circumstances of  her  martyrdom  are  unknown.  

MAURICE  (MAURITIUS,  MORITZ)  and  OTHERS (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  town  of  St.  Maurice-enValais  (the  ancient  Agaunum),  in  the  Diocese of  Sion  in  Switzerland,  takes  its  modern  name from  this  Saint.  He  was  an  officer  in  the  famous Theban  Legion,  which  was  composed  almost entirely  of  Christian  soldiers,  and  had  been sent  by  the  Emperor  Diocletian  as  a  division of  an  army  intended  for  the  coercion  of  the malcontents  who  had  risen  in  insurrection  in Gaul.  In  crossing  the  Alps,  the  order  went out  that  the  whole  army  should  join  in  a sacrifice  to  be  made  to  the  gods  of  Rome  for  the success  of  the  Imperial  arms.  The  Christian soldiers  of  the  Legion  refused  to  attend,  and were  therefore  sentenced  to  death,  and  being surrounded  by  other  troops,  massacred.  The savage  Maximinian  Herculeus  was  in  command, and  ruthlessly  had  them  exterminated  to  the last  man.  These  Martyrs  are  often  described as  having  been  between  six  and  seven  thousand in  number.  This  may  be  exaggerated.  The Roman  Martyrology  mentions  by  name, Maurice,  Exuperius,  Candidus,  Victor,  Innocent and  Vital  is  ;  and  adds,  "  with  their  fellowsoldiers  of  the  same  Legion."  The  date  is a.d.  287.  St.  Eucherius  of  Lyons  has  left  a graphic  account  of  the  tragedy.  Objections raised  in  the  sixteenth  century  against  the tradition  of  the  Theban  Legion  have  been ably  and  adequately  confuted  by  many  authors, both  Catholic  and  non-Catholic.  

MAURILIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  13)  
(5th  cent.)  A  native  of  Milan,  where  he studied  under  St.  Ambrose  and  the  future  St. Martin  of  Tours.  He  followed  the  latter  into Gaul,  and  in  due  course  was  raised  to  the Bishopric  of  Angers  (a.d.  407).  The  story  is related  of  him  that,  fearing  the  responsibilities of  a  Pastor  of  souls,  he  fled  to  England,  and there  found  employment  as  a  gardener  ;  but that,  recognised  at  last,  his  clergy  insisted  on his  return  to  his  Diocese.  He  died  a.d.  453. All  the  ancient  Martyrologies  make  mention of  him  and  of  the  miracles  he  wrought.  The people  of  Anjou  were  devoted  to  him,  both alive  and  dead. MAURINUS  (St.)  Abbot,  M.  (June  10)  
(Date  unknown.)  Of  this  Saint  we  know  no more  than  that  in  the  year  966,  when  the Abbey  Church  of  St.  Pantaleo  at  Cologne  was being  rebuilt  there  was  discovered  a  tomb with  the  inscription,  "  Here  lie  the  bones  of St.  Maurinus,  Abbot  and  Martyr,  who  was martyred  in  the  porch  of  this  church  on  June 10."  The  year  is  not  indicated.  The  body  in the  tomb  bore  traces  of  torture  and  signs  of violent  death.  Many  miracles  (for  an  account of  which  Surius  may  be  consulted)  were  wrought on  those  who  had  recourse  to  the  prayers  of the  personage  whose  bones  they  were,  and  were accepted  by  the  Ecclesiastical  authorities  as sufficient  proof  of  the  substantial  accuracy  of the  inscription.  Thus,  St.  Maurinus  obtained a  popular  cultus  at  Cologne  and  a  place  in  the later  Martyrologies.  In  A.d.  1820  his  relics were  translated  to  another  of  the  Cologne cliurcliGs MAURITIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  10)

He  left  the  Royal Court  of  the  Merovingians  to  become  a  monk in  a  monastery  near  Douai,  whence  he  governed several  communities.  He  died  a.d.  706,  in great  fame  of  sanctity.

Cassino.  The  tradition  is  that  about  A.D.  528 St.  Maurus  was  sent  by  St.  Benedict  into  France to  found  monasteries  there,  and  that  in  effect he  established  the  great  Abbey  of  Glanfeuil on  the  Loire.  He  is  said  to  have  resigned  his position  some  time  before  his  death  and  to  have retired  to  a  hermit's  cell.  He  passed  away A.D.  584.  His  relics  were  several  times  translated from  church  to  church  during  the  next twelve  hundred  years,  and  finally  disappeared in  the  catastrophe  of  the  great  French  Revolution.  

MAURUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  20)  
(10th  cent.)  A  Roman,  the  nephew  of  Pope John  IX,  who  ordained  him  to  the  priesthood. Subsequently  he  became  Bishop  of  Cesena (Central  Italy),  where  he  combined  his  active duties  as  Pastor  of  souls  with  intervals  of  retreat and  contemplation,  passed  in  a  neighbouring hermit's  cell.  In  this  cell  he  died,  and  his tomb  there  became  a  place  of  pilgrimage  and later  the  site  of  a  Benedictine  Abbey.  St. Peter  Damian  records  many  miracles  due  to  the intercession  of  St.  Maurus,  and  attested  by eye-witnesses.

He  was  afterwards  made  Abbot  of  Bodon,  or Val-Benois,  in  the  Diocese  of  Sisteron.  Dynamius,  his  biographer,  who  wrote  shortly  after the  Saint's  death  in  the  middle  of  the  sixth century,  recounts  many  miracles  wrought through  the  intercession  of  St.  Maurus.

Imprisoned  by  order  of  the  Emperor Trajan,  he  was  placed  in  the  custody  of  Sergius and  Pantaleemon,  two  of  the  Imperial  Bodyguards, whom  he  converted  to  Christianity. They  shared  his  martyrdom.  St.  Maurus  was beheaded  ;  they  were  crucified  (a.d.  117).

MAURUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Maurus  was  a  Christian. who made  many  converts  among  the  Pagans  in  the neighbourhood.  He  with  forty-nine  companions suffered  death  on  account  of  their  religion, most  probably  under  Valerian,  towards  A.D. 260  ;  though  some  modern  investigators  insist on  dating  their  martyrdom  in  the  time  of Diocletian,  thirty  or  forty  years  later.  It  is agreed  that  Reims  in  France  was  the  scene  of their  martyrdom.  

MAURUS  (S.)  Bp.  (Nov.  8)  
(4th  cent.)  The  second  Bishop  of  Verdun, memorable  for  the  number  of  miracles  wrought at  his  tomb.  These  were  especially  remarkable in  the  ninth  century,  epoch  of  the  solemn translation  and  enshrinement  of  the  Relics  of the  early  Saint,  of  whom  we  have  otherwise little  or  no  record.  

MAURUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  21)  
(7th  cent.)  St.  Maurus,  Bishop  of  Vienne (France),  was  renowned  for  his  humility  and  for his  care  of  the  poor,  for  whose  benefit  he established  several  Houses  of  Refuge.  Late  in his  life  he  resigned  his  See  and  retired  to  a hermitage,  and  for  seven  years  lived  a  life  of great  austerity.  It  is  related  that,  warned  by an  Angel,  he  returned  to  the  city  and  entered a  church  where,  while  engaged  in  prayer,  he tranquilly  expired  (A.D.  600  about) ;  and  it  is added  that  at  once  the  bells  of  all  the  churches began  of  themselves  to  toll,  and  so  to  announce to  his  former  flock  the  news  of  his  happy  end. 188 

MAURUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  This  holy  man,  from  his  youth gave  himself  up  to  prayer  and  the  exercises  of the  spiritual  life.  Coming  to  man's  estate, he  distributed  all  his  wealth  among  the  poor. He  was  a  native  of  Africa,  and  like  many  of  his Christian  compatriots,  was  determined  on making  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome.  There  he  spent three  years  spreading  the  Christian  Faith and  assisting,  so  far  as  lay  in  his  power,  all who  were  in  distress.  At  length  he  was  arrested, put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded.  The  date given  is  A.D.  284.  The  relics  of  the  Saint  were to  have  been  carried  back  to  his  native  Africa  ; but,  in  consequence  of  a  shipwreck,  they  were landed  in  Southern  Italy,  and  have  there remained  to  this  day.

MAVILUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  4)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  young  African  Christian,  flung to  the  wild  beasts  in  the  arena,  during  the persecution  under  the  Emperor  Septimus Sever  us.  The  early  and  contemporary  writer Tertullian  makes  this  crime,  of  which  he accuses  in  particular  a  judge  named  Scapula, responsible  for  certain  natural  catastrophes which  quickly  followed,  and  which  he  attributes to  the  Divine  vengeance.  

♦MAWES  (MAUDITUS,  MAUDEZ)  (St.)  (May  17) (6th  cent.)  A  Cornish  Saint  who  lived  as  a hermit  near  Falmouth.  He  flourished  in  the sixth  century,  and  is  said  to  have  been  of  Irish descent.  He  is  known  in  Brittany  as  St. Maudez.  There  has  been  an  attempt  to identify  St.  Mawes  with  the  famous  St.  Malo (Machutus),  but  the  arguments  brought forward  in  favour  of  this  theory  are  far  from convincing.

suffered  martyrdom.  But  the  particulars  are 
lost  or  uncertain.  

MAXENTIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  26)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  at  Agde  in  the  South  of France,  he  was  educated  by  St.  Severus  and  by a  holy  priest  who  lived  in  the  neighbourhood of  Poitiers.  He  entered  a  monastery  of  which his  merits,  in  time,  caused  him  to  be  elected Abbot.  He  was  graced  with  the  gift  of  working miracles,  and  was  famous  throughout  Gaul  for his  sanctity.  He  died  (A.D.  518)  when  in  his seventieth  year,  and  his  Abbey  thenceforth bore  his  name,  Saint-Maixeuil.  

MAXENTIUS,  CRESCENTIUS,  CONSTANTIUS, JUSTINUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  12) (3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Treves,  who  bore witness  to  Christ  at  the  outset  of  the  reign  of Diocletian  (A.D.  287).  Their  bodies,  buried  in the  crypt  of  the  church  of  St.  Paulinus  by  St. Felix,  were  solemnly  enshrined,  A.D.  1071.

MAXIMA  (St.)  V.  (May  16)  
(8th  cent.)  The  Acts  of  this  Saint  are  lost. Tradition  presents  her  as  a  maiden  of  noble birth  who  lived  a  life  of  eminent  piety  and  of marvellous  graces  in  the  eighth  or  ninth  century in  the  country  about  Frejus  in  the  South  of France.  Several  villages  in  Provence  are  called after  her.  The  Saracen  inroads  are  probably responsible  for  the  destruction  of  all  documents respecting  her.

MAXIMA  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  A  victim  at  Rome  of  the  persecution under  Diocletian  (A.D.  304).  She  appears to  have  been  arraigned  before  the  judges  at  the same  time  as  St.  Ansanus.  Both  were  scourged ; but  while  Ansanus  survived  to  be  taken  for execution  to  Siena  in  Tuscany,  Maxima  expired under  the  lash.  The  Roman  scourge  was  often loaded  with  leaden  balls  or  spiked,  and  it  was no  uncommon  occurrence  for  its  infliction  to  have fatal  consequences.

MAXIMIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  21)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Ravenna,  consecrated by  Pope  Vigilius  (A.D.  546).  He  built many  churches  in  that  city,  including  the magnificent  Basilica  of  St.  Vitalis,  which  he consecrated  in  the  presence  of  the  Emperor Justinian  and  his  Empress  Theodora.  He died  about  A.D.  556.  

MAXIMIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (June  9)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Sicilian  by  birth  and  a  member of  the  monastic  community  St.  Gregory  the Great  established  in  his  family  mansion  on  the Coelian  Hill.  He  served  both  St.  Gregory  and his  predecessor  Pelagius  as  their  representative at  the  Court  of  Constantinople,  and  in  Rome for  a  time  acted  as  minister  to  St.  Gregory. The  latter  appointed  him  Bishop  of  Syracuse and  his  Legate  in  Sicily,  where  the  Saint  died (A.D.  594)  in  the  third  year  of  his  Episcopate. To  the  zeal,  wisdom  and  virtues  of  St.  Maximian St.  Gregory  bears  eloquent  testimony  in  his Letters,  speaking  of  him  as  "  a  man  of  holy memory,  a  most  faithful  servant  of  God,  a worthy  Father  of  his  Church,  and  after  death  a member  of  the  Heavenly  Choir."

MAXIMIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  3)  
(5th  cent.)  An  African,  a  convert  from  the Donatist  heresy,  who  was  appointed  to  the  See of  Bagaja,  a  suffragan  Bishopric  in  the  Province of  Carthage.  But  finding  his  nomination  displeasing to  the  people,  he  persuaded  the  Fathers of  the  Council  of  Milevis  to  accept  his  resignation. St.  Augustine  in  one  of  his  Sermons recalls  this  fact.  Maximian  afterwards  fell  into the  power  of  the  Donatists,  by  whom  he  was  so grievously  maltreated  that  after  his  death  he was  venerated  as  a  Martyr.  When  his  wounds had  been  healed  he  crossed  over  into  Italy  and stated  his  case  to  the  Emperor  Honorius,  with the  result  that  the  latter  issued  a  Decree restraining  the  violence  of  the  heretics  (a.d. 404).

MAXIMILIAN  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  12)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  native  of  Noricum  (the  territory between  the  Inn  and  the  Danube).  Promoted to  the  priesthood  after  a  successful missionary  career,  he  was  elected  Bishop  of Lorsch  (a.d.  257).  But  during  a  visit  he  was paying  to  his  native  town  of  Celeia  (Cilly)  he was  arrested  as  a  Christian  and  put  to  death  on his  refusal  to  offer  sacrifice  to  the  god  Mars. According  to  most  documents,  his  death occurred  A.D.  281,  but  by  some  it  is  set  down as  having  happened  in  the  first  years  of  the  reign of  Diocletian,  that  is,  nine  or  ten  years  later. St.  Rupert  of  Salzburg  erected  churches  in honour  of St.  Maximilian. The  relics  of  the 

latter  are  now  at  Passau,  whither  it  is  said  they were  translated  early  in  the  eleventh  centurv.  

MAXIMILIAN  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  29)  
(Date  unknown.)  This  Saint  is  registered in  the  Roman  Martyrology  together  with  a  St. Valentine,  described  as  a  Confessor,  and  without further  comment.  By  many  this  St.  Maximilian is  now  considered  to  be  identical  with  St. Maximilian,  Bishop  of  Lorsch  (Oct.  12).  Certain old  documents  add  the  word  "  Patavii  " as  the  place  with  which  St.  Maximilian  was connected.  By  this  may  very  well  be  meant "  Passau,"  where  is  now  the  shrine  of  the  St. Maximilian  of  Oct.  12.  Of  the  St.  Valentine, coupled  with  St.  Maximilian  on  Oct.  29,  nothing whatever  is  known.

See  SS.  JUVENTINUS  and  MAXIMIN.  

MAXIMIN  (St.)  Bp.  (March  29)  
(4th  cent.)  Born  near  Loudon  (Poitou),  at the  end  of  the  third  or  beginning  of  the  fourth century,  he  was  a  brother  of  St.  Maxentius, Bishop  of  Poitiers,  and  one  of  a  family  of  Saints. He  was  educated  by  St.  Agritius  of  Treves, whom  he  succeeded  in  that  See.  St.  Jerome speaks  of  St.  Maximin  as  "  a  generous  defender of  the  Faith  and  one  of  the  most  courageous Bishops  of  his  time."  He  gloried  in  receiving the  exiled  St.  Athanasius  as  his  guest,  and surrounded  him  with  all  the  honours  and  state due  to  his  Patriarchal  dignity.  And  he  extended the  same  hospitality  to  St.  Paul,  the  similarly exiled  Patriarch  of  Constantinople.  As  a  champion of  the  Catholic  Faith  in  the  Trinity, St.  Maximin  was  prominent  in  the  Councils of  Milan,  Sardica  and  Cologne.  He  died  while on  a  visit  to  his  birthplace  in  the  West  of France,  about  a.d.  349  ;  but  his  body  was  later taken  back  to  Treves.  

MAXIMIN  (St.)  M.  (June  8)  
(1st  cent.)  A  tradition  dating  from  the  earliest times  avers  that  this  St.  Maximin,  the  first Bishop  of  Aix  in  Provence,  was  a  Palestinian, one  of  the  disciples  of  Our  Lord,  and  that  he accompanied  SS.  Martha  and  Magdalen,  with their  brother  Lazarus  to  the  South  of  France. The  body  of  St.  Maximin  was  enshrined  in  the church  of  the  small  neighbouring  town  which bears  his  name  ;  but  was  subsequently  translated to  the  Cathedral  of  Aix.  Another  tradition adds  that  St.  Maximin  was  the  man  born blind  to  whom  Christ  gave  sight  (John  ix.).  

MAXIMIN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Dec.  15)  
(6th  cent.)  St.  Maximin  (Mesmin)  was  the first  Abbot  of  the  famous  monastery  of  Micy, founded  near  Orleans  by  King  Clovis.  His sanctity  and  miracles  brought  him  many disciples,  several  of  whom,  like  St.  Avitus,  were afterwards  enrolled  in  the  list  of  Saints.  He died  about  a.d.  520.  

MAXIMUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  8)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Pavia  in  Lombardy. He  died  a.d.  511,  and  is  honourably  mentioned in  the  writings  of  St.  Ennodius  and  of  Paul  the Deacon.  He  took  part  in  the  Councils  celebrated in  Rome  under  Pope  Symmachus. Another  St.  Maximin,  Bishop  of  Pavia  in  the third  century,  is  also  venerated  as  a  Saint.  

MAXIMUS  of  NOLA  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  This  holy  Bishop,  who  is  associated with  the  more  famous  Martyr  St.  Felix  of Nola,  was  forced  into  exile  during  the  persecution under  Decius  (a.d.  250).  He  had  much  to suffer  during  his  long  life  ;  and  eventually  died worn  out  with  old  age  and  with  the  weight of  the  burden  he  had  patiently  borne  in  the cause  of  his  Divine  Master.

MAXIMUS 
is  detailed  in  the  Acts  of  St.  Susanna.  Pope Caius  baptised  in  Rome  Maxim  us  and  Claudius, with  Praepedigna,  the  wife  of  the  latter,  and their  two  sons,  Alexander  and  Cuthias.  Arrested as  Christians,  they  were  all  burned  at the  stake  (A.d.  295).  Their  ashes  were  cast into  the  Tiber  ;  but,  recovered  at  least  in  part by  the  Christians,  they  were  buried  at  Ostia, at  the  mouth  of  the  river.  They  all  appear  in most  of  the  Martyrologies,  but  with  the  names variously  spelled. MAXIMUS,  QUINCTILLIANUS  and  DADAS 
(SS.)  MM.  (April  13)  
(4th  cent.)  Maximus,  a  Reader  and  interpreter of  the  Scriptures,  with  his  disciples, Quinctillianus  and  Dadas,  was  arrested,  condemned and  beheaded  at  Dorostorum  in  Lower Mysia  (now  Sillistria  in  Bulgaria)  about  a.d. 303.  They  were  therefore  among  the  countless victims  of  the  great  persecution  under  Diocletian, the  tragic  prelude  to  the  Peace  of  the Church  established  by  Constantine.

See  SS.  TIBURTIUS,  VALERIAN, &c. MAXIMUS  and  OLYMPIAS  (SS.)  MM. (April  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Acts  of  these  Martyrs  are included  in  the  various  accounts  of  the  Passion of  the  Martyr  St.  Laurence.  We  are  told  that the  Emperor  "Valerian  in  his  unhappy  invasion of  Persia  found  various  groups  of  Christians whom  as  in  the  West  he  ruthlessly  persecuted. Among  the  victims  were  two  nobles,  Maximus and  Olympias  by  name.  Some  say  that  they were  beheaded  ;  others  that  their  heads  were smashed  with  crowbars.  It  is  recorded  that during  the  preliminary  scourging  to  which  they were  subjected  they  never  ceased  from  chanting Psalms,  as  they  were  accustomed  to  do  in church.  The  better  known  Persian  Saints Abdon  and  Sennen,  it  is  alleged,  recovered  and honourably  interred  their  bodies  (A.D.  251). MAXIMUS  (St.)  M.  (April  30)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  citizen  of  Ephesus,  a  merchant by  profession,  who  on  the  publication  (a.d.  250) of  the  Edict  of  the  Emperor  Decius  against  the Christians,  publicly  proclaimed  himself  to  be one  of  them.  He  was  arrested,  and  after  a  long interrogatory  sentenced  to  be  stoned  to  death. The  sentence  was  duly  executed.  His  original Acts  are  to  be  found  in  most  hagiographies. The  Greeks  honour  him  on  May  14,  the  anniversary of  his  death. MAXIMUS  of  JERUSALEM  (St.)  Bp. (May  5)  
(4th  cent.)  The  successor  in  the  See  of  Jerusalem of  St.  Macarius  and  the  predecessor of  St.  Cyril,  whom  he  ordained  and  to  whom he  entrusted  the  instruction  of  the  catechumens. St.  Maximus  completed  the  building  of  the famous  Basilica  of  the  Holy  Sepulchre.  During the  persecution  at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth century,  Maximus,  then  only  a  priest,  had  had much  to  suffer  ;  and  it  was  to  the  honourable wounds  then  received  by  St.  Maximus  that St.  Paphnutius  called  the  attention  of  the Bishops  assembled  at  the  Council  of  Tyre, in  which  St.  Maximus  in  his  simplicity  had been  made  a  tool  of  the  enemies  of  St.  Athanasius.  A  proof  of  his  Orthodoxy  is  the  fact  that he  was  the  first  of  the  Bishops  of  Palestine  to sign  the  Acts  of  the  Council  of  Sardica.  And  on the  return  of  St.  Athanasius  from  exile  St.  Maximus summoned  all  his  Bishops  to  welcome  and  to honour  the  holv  Doctor.  He  died  about  a.d.  350.

Like  others,  they  were put  to  the  torture  before  being  beheaded.  They had  been  all  three  disciples  of  the  Martyr St.  Athimus,  who  is  commemorated  on  the same  day  with  them.

Pope  St.  Damasus  (a.d.  366-384)  to  preach Christianity  in  the  North  of  France,  where  they laid  down  their  lives  for  their  Master,  near Evreux.  

MAXIMUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  25)  
(5th  cent.)  A  celebrated  Bishop  of  Turin who  governed  his  flock  wisely  and  successfully in  the  troublous  times  of  the  Barbarian  inroads into  Italy.  In  the  Acts  of  the  Council  of  Rome (a.d.  465)  his  signature  follows  immediately on  that  of  the  Pope,  St.  Hilary.  His  death occurred  a.d.  470  at  latest.  Gennadius  describes him  as  one  of  the  brightest  lights  of  the  Church of  the  fifth  century,  by  reason  of  his  zeal  and care  of  the  spiritual  and  temporal  well-being of  his  flock,  and  of  his  fervent  eloquence  and profound  learning.  His  Homilies,  which  have been  several  times  published,  are  very  useful, and  several  of  them  appeal  as  much  to  the Christian  mind  of  the  twentieth  century  Faithful as  they  did  that  of  his  hearers,  fourteen  hundred years  ago.

MAXIMUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  2)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  second  Bishop  of  Padua, successor  and  chronicler  of  his  predecessor, St.  Prosdocimus.  He  worked  many  miracles. His  cultus  received  a  great  impetus  when  his body  was  solemnly  translated  and  enshrined, A.D.  1053.  

MAXIMUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  13)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Greek  of  noble  birth  at  first attached  to  the  Court  of  the  Emperor  Heraclius, but  who  retired  to  the  monastery  of  Chrysopolis (Scutari)  and  devoted  himself  to  Ecclesiastical studies.  He  was  a  great  champion  of  Orthodoxy against  the  Monothelite  heretics,  and assisted  at  the  Lateran  Council  of  A.d.  649. By  order  of  the  Emperor,  who  sided  with  the Monothelites,  or  at  least  wished  to  hush  up  the controversy,  St.  Maximus  was  seized  in  Rome and  taken  as  a  prisoner  to  Constantinople. There,  on  his  refusal  to  abate  aught  of  his Catholic  Faith,  his  right  hand  was  cut  off  and his  tongue  torn  out.  His  disciple,  St.  Anastasius  suffered  the  same  fate,  and  they  both died  in  prison  of  their  wounds  (a.d.  662). St.  Maximus  was  a  voluminous  writer,  and acquired  the  surname  of  "Theologus"  (The Theologian).  There  have  been  several  editions of  his  works  published  in  modern  times.

MAXIMUS  (St.)  (Aug.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Martin  of  Tours, and  probably  a  native  of  Aquitaine.  He  left the  world  for  the  solitude  of  a  hermitage,  but his  singular  sanctity  becoming  known,  he  took refuge  from  his  admirers  in  a  monastery. But  the  monks  insisted  on  electing  him  to  be their  Abbot,  on  which  he  departed  in  search again  of  solitude.  He  finally  settled  at  Chinon in  Touraine.  On  disciples  again  gathering about  him,  he  resigned  himself  to  the  inevitable, and  founded  a  monastery  for  them.  It  was  there that  he  died.  St.  Gregory  of  Tours  enlarges at  great  length  on  his  merits  and  virtues,  and on  the  great  services  he  rendered  to  the  people in  his  vicinity  in  various  troubles  that  came upon  them.

(SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  15)  
(4th cent.)  Three Christians, natives of 
Marcianopolis  (an  ancient  town  in  what  is  now 
Bulgaria), who were zealous in  spreading  a 
knowledge  of  Christianity  through  Thrace  and 
MEDRAN 

Mysia.  They  suffered  death  for  their Faith at  Adrianople  under  Maximin  Galerius,  probably about  a.d.  310. MAXIMUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  25)  

See  SS.  PAUL,  TATTA, &c. MAXIMUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  28)  
(3rd  cent.) According  to  the  best  authorities, one  and  the  same  with  the  St.  Maximus,  M., registered  under  April  30  in  the  Roman  Martyrology. MAXIMUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  20)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  the  city  of Aquila  in  the  South  of  Italy.  He  was  a  deacon, zealous  in  preaching  and  in  drawing  souls  to Christ.  When  the  persecution  under  Decius (A.D.  250)  broke  out,  he  was  one  of  the  first to  be  arrested.  Indeed,  according  to  some authorities,  he  voluntarily  gave  himself  up. There  is  a  long  account  of  the  savage  tortures to  which  he  was  subjected  and  of  the  flattering offers  made  to  him  if  he  would  but  renounce Christ.  The  Imperial  officers  were  the  more intent  on  making  him  yield  to  temptation because  he  evidently  was  one  of  the  most conspicuous  and  influential  personages  in  the locality.  But  all  attempts  of  the  sort  were vain  ;  and  in  fine  the  death  sentence  came. It  was  carried  out  by  casting  the  Martyr  down from  an  overhanging  cliff.  Among  pilgrims to  his  shrine  in  the  course  of  the  Middle  Ages were  the  Emperor  Otho  the  Great  of  Germany and  the  Pope  of  his  time. MAXIMUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  30)  
(4th  cent.)  The  Roman  Martyrology  places the  scene  of  the  martyrdom  of  this  Saint  at Apamea  in  Phrygia,  whereas  there  are  many reasons  for  identifying  him  with  a  Martyr of  the  same  name  who  suffered  at  Cuma  in Southern  Italy.  In  the  one  and  the  other case  the  Martyrs  perished  under  Diocletian  at the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century,  and  their Feast  days  are  both  Oct.  30.  There  is,  moreover, or  rather  there  once  was,  a  town  or  village in  the  neighbourhood  of  Cuma  called  Apamea. However  this  may  be,  we  have  of  St.  Maximus the  usual  account  of  a  series  of  savage  torturings and  prolix  examinations,  preceding  his  sentence and  execution. MAXIMUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  18)  
(4th  cent.)  The  nineteenth  Bishop  of  Mainz or  Mayence.  He  succeeded  St.  Lucius,  who was  strangled  in  Phrygia  by  the  Arians.  St. Maximus  himself  was  again  and  again  driven from  his  See  by  the  Arian  faction,  but  he steadily  clung  to  his  post.  He  was  distinguished by  his  literary  attainments,  and  wrote  several works  bearing  on  the  controversies  of  his  time. He  seems  to  have  been  eminently  successful as  a  Pastor  of  souls,  and  held  his  See  for  about a  quarter  of  a  century.  At  length,  worn  out with  suffering  and  fatigue,  he  nominated  Sidonius,  a  trustworthy  Ecclesiastic,  to  succeed him  and  shortly  afterwards  passed  away  (a.d. 378). MAXIMUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  19)  
(3rd  cent.)  He  is  registered  in  the  Roman Martyrology  as  having  suffered  in  Rome  under the  Emperor  Valerian  (A.D.  254-259).  It is  added  that  he  was  a  priest  and  that  he was  interred  in  the  Catacombs  of  St.  Xystus. There  is  no  other  record  of  him. MAXIMUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  27)  
(5th  cent.)  The  second  Abbot  of  the  great island  monastery  of  Lerins  in  the  Mediterranean. His  fame  for  talent  and  virtue  led  to  several attempts  to  make  him  accept  the  charge  of  a Diocese.  And  at  length  the  Ecclesiastical authorities  prevailed  upon  him  to  take  upon himself  the  charge  of  the  Diocese  of  Riez,  to which  he  was  consecrated  by  St.  Hilary  (A.D. 434).  As  a  Bishop,  he  was  loved,  feared  and respected  by  all  on  account  of  his  charity, vigilance  and  energy.  He  died  A.D.  462,  having built  several  churches  and  monasteries,  which in  the  course  of  ages  came  to  be  called  after 

him.  His  contemporary  and  immediate  successor, Faust  us,  wrote  his  life.

See  SS.  EUSEBIUS,  MARCELLUS, &c.  

MAXIMUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  27)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  Patriarch  of  Alexandria who  succeeded  St.  Dionysius  in  that  See  (A.D. 282  about).  It  would  seem  too  that  in  the lifetime  of  his  predecessor,  at  the  times  when St.  Dionysius  found  it  necessary  to  leave Alexandria  because  of  the  fierce  persecution of  which  he  in  particular  was  the  object,  St. Maximus  temporarily  filled  his  place.  The latter  seems  to  have  also  been  a  Prelate  in high  repute  for  piety  and  learning.

(8th  cent,  probably.)  One  of  a  band  of  nine holy  maidens  who  came  over  from  Ireland  to Scotland  and  founded  a  Religious  community at  Abernethy,  on  the  Tay.  Mazota  seems  to have  been  in  higher  repute  of  sanctity  than  the others.  Her  Feast  was  kept  liturgically,  and her  tomb  became  a  noted  place  of  pilgrimage.  

♦MECHTILDIS  (St.)  V.  (Nov.  19)  
(13th  cent.)  A  nun  in  Germany  in  the Convent  governed  by  St.  Gertrude,  of  whom she  was  perhaps  the  sister.  She  has  left  us  a marvellous  volume  of  the  Revelations  made to  her  by  Our  Blessed  Lord,  and  is  remarkable as  having  been  among  the  first  to  propagate devotion  to  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus.  Recently there  has  been  a  controversy  among  the  learned as  to  whether  there  may  not  have  been  two contemporary  Saints  of  the  name  of  Mechtildis, the  accounts  of  whom  have  become  confused. Another  German  Saint  of  the  same  name,  a  recluse near  Spanheim,  flourished  a  century  earlier.

(8th  cent.)  An  Irish  maiden  who  passed over  into  Scotland  and  lived  a  holy  life  in Galloway,  miracles  attesting  her  sanctity. She  is  possibly  identical  with  the  St.  Midhnat venerated  in  West  Meath  on  Nov.  18.  

MEDARD  (St.)  Bp.  (June  8)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  in  Picardy,  St.  Medard  is said  to  have  been  the  twin-brother  of  St. Gildard,  Archbishop  of  Rouen.  St.  Medard became  Bishop  of  Vermand,  which  See,  for greater  safety  from  the  incursions  of  the Northmen,  he  transferred  to  Noyon,  a  formidable fortress.  He  was  also  entrusted  with  the administration  of  the  vacant  Diocese  of  Tournai, a  task  which  tested  to  the  uttermost  his  wonderful zeal  and  fortitude.  He  lived  to  a  great age,  and  died  worn  out  with  toil,  a.d.  545. On  his  deathbed  he  was  visited  by  King Clothair,  who  sought  his  blessing  and  forgiveness for  the  injuries  he  had  done  him.  This  monarch insisted  that  St.  Medard  should  be  buried  at Soissons,  his  capital,  where  he  founded  a  noble Basilica  to  commemorate  his  memory  and merits.  

MEDERICUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  29)  
(7th  cent.)  Born  at  Autun  (France),  he entered  a  monastery  of  that  city  in  his  early youth.  Later,  he  was  appointed  to  be  its Abbot.  He  fulfilled  the  duties  of  this  office with  wonderful  success  ;  but,  wearying  of  the responsibilities  of  government  and  of  having incessantly  to  meet  crowds  of  people  attracted to  the  Abbey  by  the  fame  of  his  virtues  and miracles,  he  retired  to  a  solitude  in  the  vicinity where  he  built  himself  a  cell.  Later,  he  was obliged  by  his  Bishop  to  reassume  his  former charge.  The  last  we  hear  of  him  is  that  he made  a  pilgrimage  to  the  tomb  of  St.  Germanus of  Paris,  and  died  there  (a.d.  700),  on  a  day  he had  himself  fore-announced.  In  France  he  is known  as  St.  Merri  or  St.  Merry.

(9th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  Eastern  France,  who became  when  in  his  twenty-fifth  year  a  monk at  Reichenau,  near  Lake  Constance.  After being  ordained  priest,  he  was  employed  for  some years  in  the  care  of  souls  and  in  the  instruction of  youth.  But  in  middle  life  he  felt  called  to solitude,  and  at  length  found  a  resting-place in  a  dense  forest  in  Switzerland,  where  he  built a  cell  and  a  chapel,  placing  therein  a  statue of  the  Blessed  Virgin  presented  to  him  by  a Benedictine  Abbess.  This  statue  came  to  be called  that  of  "  Our  Lady  of  the  Hermits," and  the  chapel  itself  Einsiedeln  (Hermitage). St.  Meinrad,  after  several  years  passed  there  as a  Recluse,  was  murdered  by  some  ruffians, who  thought  to  discover  hidden  treasures  in the  poor  hermitage  (A.D.  861).  On  the  spot arose  the  celebrated  Abbey  of  Einsiedeln,  still flourishing  in  our  own  day.  St.  Meinrad  was canonised  about  A.D.  1000,  and  is  traditionally venerated  as  a  Martyr. *MEINULPH  (St.)  (Oct.  5)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  the  circle  of  Charlemagne, who  is  said  to  have  adopted  Meinulph as  his  son.  He  was  distinguished  for  his piety,  meekness  and  humility.  He  died  in Westphalia  (about  A.D.  859)  in  a  monastery which  he  had  founded. *MEL  (MELCHNO)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  6)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  earliest  of  the  Irish Saints.  He  was  a  nephew  of  St.  Patrick,  and by  him  appointed  first  Bishop  of  Ardagh. There  St.  Mel  built  a  great  monastery  and governed  it  as  Abbot.  It  was  he  who  gave  the veil  of  religion  to  St.  Brigid.  He  lived  till towards  the  close  of  the  fifth  century.  Ardagh Diocese  venerates  him  as  its  Patron  Saint. *MELANGELL  (MONACELLA)  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  31)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Saint  commemorated  in  certain Welsh  Kalendars.  She  lived  an  austere  life as  a  recluse,  in  Montgomeryshire,  at  the  end of  the  sixth  century.  Incidents  in  her  legend are  represented  on  the  screen  of  the  church  of Pennant-Melangell. MELANIA  THE  YOUNGER  and  PINIANUS 
(SS.)  (Dec.  31)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Roman  lady  and  her  husband, persons  of  great  wealth  and  prominent  in  the world  of  their  time.  Having  lost  by  death their  two  children,  they  resolved  on  embracing a  life  of  Evangelical  perfection.  Selling  all their  goods  and  distributing  the  proceeds  to the  poor,  they  established  themselves  in  Palestine in  monasteries  they  had  founded.  Among their  friends  they  reckoned  SS.  Augustine  and Jerome,  the  latter  of  whom  in  particular  acted as  their  guide  in  the  spiritual  path  they  had chosen.  St.  Melania  outlived  her  husband. Her  death  took  place  in  A.D.  439.  Their memory  is  in  great  veneration,  especially  in the  Eastern  Church.  The  Life  of  St.  Melania, written  by  the  late  Cardinal  Rampolla,  is  among the  most  remarkable  contributions  made  to Hagiography  in  our  time.  St.  Melania  is styled  the  Younger  to  distinguish  her  from  her paternal  grandmother,  whose  holy  life  likewise led  to  her  being  numbered  among  Saints  venerated bv  Holy  Church. MELANIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  6)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Breton  Saint,  made  Bishop  of Rennes,  and  a  prominent  prelate  in  his  time, when  the  Franks  were  overrunning  Gaul.  He enjoyed  the  favour  of  their  King  Clovis  after the  latter  had  become  a  Christian.  St.  Melanius succeeded  in  almost  entirely  extirpating  idolatry from  his  own  Diocese  of  Rennes,  and  died in  great  fame  of  sanctity  A.D.  530.

(4th  cent.)  A  holy  Bishop  of  a  town  on  the borders  of  the  desert  separating  Egypt  from Palestine.  He  was  one  of  the  sufferers  from the  predominating  influence  of  the  Arian heretics  at  the  Court  of  Constantinople,  and like  other  Catholic  Bishops  underwent  imprisonment and  banishment  during  the  reign  of  the Emperor  Valens.  After  the  death  of  the  latter (A.D.  379)  Melas  was  restored  to  his  people, and  died  peacefully  among  them,  some  time in  the  reign  of  Theodosius.  The  historian Sozomen  alleges  that  he  knew  St.  Melas personally,  as  also  the  latter 's  brother  and successor,  St.  Solon.

♦MELDON  (MEDON)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  7)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  of  whom  hardly 
anything  is  now  known.  He  died  at  Peronne 
in  France,  and  is  the  Title  Saint  of  several 
churches.  

MELETIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  12)  
(4th  cent.)  Born  at  Melitene  in  Armenia, he  became  Bishop  of  Sebaste  in  that  country  ; but  was  shortly  afterwards  elected  to  fill  the great  Patriarchal  See  of  Antioch,  at  a  time (A.D.  360)  when  that  Church  was  struggling in  the  throes  of  a  schism.  This  was  done  in the  hope  that  his  sincerity,  virtues  and  kindly disposition  might  effect  the  reconciliation  of the  contending  parties.  But  within  a  month the  Emperor  Constantius  sent  him  into  exile. Recalled  for  a  brief  space  under  the  Emperor Jovian,  he  was  again  banished,  and  not  fully reinstated  till  towards  the  end  of  A.D.  378, under  Gratian.  He  held  a  Council  of  one hundred  and  fifty  Bishops,  and  was  prominent in  that  of  Constantinople  (a.d.  381).  He enthroned  St.  Gregory  Nazianzen  as  Bishop of  the  Imperial  city.  St.  Meletius  died  during the  sitting  of  the  Council  of  Constantinople  ; but  his  body  was  carried  back  to  Antioch  and laid  beside  that  of  St.  Babylas,  the  MartyrPatron  of  the  city.  Both  St.  John  Chrysostom and  St.  Gregory  of  Nyssa  preached  Panegyrics of  St.  Meletius ;  and  St.  John  Damascene gives  him  the  title  of  Martyr.  

MELETIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  24)  
(Date  unknown.)  This  Saint  was  an  officer in  the  Imperial  army  who  with  two  hundred and  fifty-two  of  his  soldiers,  suffered  the  death penalty  as  being  avowed  Christians.  The Roman  Martyrology  gives  neither  time  nor place,  and  the  details  found  in  the  Greek Menologies  do  not  seem  trustworthy.  They aver  that  the  Martyrs  suffered  at  Ancyra  in Galatia,  but  also  fail  to  indicate  any  date.  

MELETIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  21)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Menology  of  Basil associates  the  name  of  this  St.  Meletius  with that  of  St.  Isaacius,  who  is  styled  a  Martyr. They  are  both  described  as  Bishops  in  Cyprus  ; but  beyond  ascribing  to  them  the  virtues  and eminent  qualities  common  to  all  saintly  Bishops, the  documents  extant  record  nothing  material concerning  either  of  them,  nor  can  any  even approximate  date  be  assigned  to  them.  

MELETIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  4)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  historian  Eusebius  (a  personal friend  of  this  St.  Meletius)  relates  that he  gained  his  name  of  Meletius,  derived  from ' '  mel  Atticum, "  by  reason  of  his  great  eloquence. He  describes  him  as  perfect  in  all  things  and resplendent  with  every  virtue.  He  was  a Bishop  in  Pontus,  near  the  coast  of  the  Black Sea,  and  took  refuge  with  Eusebius  in  one  of the  persecutions  so  frequent  in  his  time.  St. Basil  also  speaks  of  the  esteem  in  which  St. 
MENIGNUS 

Meletius  was  held  by  all.  He  seems  to  have died  in  his  own  city  before  the  close  of  the third  century. MELEUSIPPUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  17)  

See  SS.  SPEUSIPPUS,  ELEUSIPPUS, &c. MELITINA  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  15)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Martyr  of  Marcianopolis  in Thrace  who  suffered  under  the  Emperor  Marcus Aurelius,  the  Philosopher,  about  the  middle of  the  second  century.  She  appears  to  have previously  been  zealous  in  doing  her  best  to spread  Christianity,  and  so  to  have  attracted special  attention.  She  was  severely  scourged and  beheaded.  Her  remains  were  taken  for burial  to  the  Isle  of  Lemnos  in  the  JEgean  Sea by  a  devout  Christian,  who,  falling  ill  during the  voyage,  was  shortly  afterwards  interred  at her  side. *MELITO  (St.)  Bp.  (April  1)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Sardis  in  Lydia 
(Asia  Minor),  author  of  an  Apology  or  work 
in defence of Christianity, addressed  to  the 
Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius.  

♦MELLA  (St.)  Widow.  (April  25)  
(8th  cent.)  Born  in  Connaught,  St.  Mella became  the  mother  of  two  Saints,  Cannech  and Tigernach.  After  the  death  of  her  husband she  embraced  the  Religious  life  and  died  Abbess of  Lough-Melvin. MELLANIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  22)

(7th  cent.)  A  Roman  monk,  one  of  the  band of  missionaries  sent  by  St.  Gregory  to  aid St.  Augustine  in  the  work  he  had  begun  some years  before  in  Kent,  and  to  further  spread  the Gospel  among  the  Anglo-Saxons.  St.  Augustine consecrated  him  Bishop  of  the  East  Saxons, with  his  See  in  London.  Trouble  with  the Pagan  Princes  of  Essex  drove  him  into  exile into  France  ;  but  he  soon  forced  his  way  back to  liis  work,  and  on  the  death  of  St.  Laurence, succeeded  him  in  the  Archbishopric  of  Canterbury. He  governed  the  nascent  English  Church with  wonderful  success,  despite  grave  bodily infirmities.  He  passed  away  a.d.  624. MELLO  (MELLON)  (St.)  Bp.  Oct.  22nd 
Otherwise  St.  MELLONIUS,  which  see. MELLONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  This  Saint,  whose  name  the Roman  Martyrology  renders  as  "  Melanius," is  supposed  to  have  been  a  native  of  Great Britain.  The  churches  of  St.  Mellon  and  St. Mullion  in  Wales  and  Cornwall  may  possibly commemorate  him,  though  other  Patron  Saints with  similar  names  have  been  by  some  assigned to  them.  St.  Mellonius  is  stated  to  have  gone to  Rome  and  to  have  been  sent  thence  as  a missionary  by  Pope  St.  Stephen,  about  the middle  of  the  third  century.  He  stayed  in Northern  Gaul,  and  is  venerated  as  the  Founder and  first  Bishop  of  the  See  of  Rouen.  After  a long  Episcopate  he  retired  to  a  hermit's  cell at  a  place  called  Hericourt,  where  he  died a.d.  314. *MELORIUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  1)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Saint  venerated  both  in Catholic  England,  chiefly  at  Amcsbury,  and  in Brittany.  He  is  said  to  have  been  the  son  of a  chieftain  in  Cornwall  and  a  convert  to  Christianity, done  to  death  on  that  account  early in  the  fifth  century.  But  no  source  of  authentic information  is  now  available. MEMMIUS  (St.)  P.p.  (Aug. 5 
(2nd  cent.)  The  Saint  popularly  known  in France  as  St.  Menge.  The  tradition  is  that  he was  one  of  the  zealous  men  sent  by  St.  Peter as  Apostles  into  Gaul.  The  raising  of  the dead  to  life  and  many  other  miracles  are  said to  have  borne  witness  to  the  truth  of  his preaching.  He  made  numberless  conversions 

among  the  population.  He  is  also  credited with  having  systematically  divided  his  Diocese into  parishes  and  thoroughly  organised  it.  A visit  to  Rome  led  to  his  extending  the  sphere of  his  labours  into  the  adjoining  districts.  His Episcopate  is  said  to  have  been  a  very  long  one, the  date  of  his  death  being  put  as  late  as  A.D. 126.  As  in  similar  cases  regarding  the  planting of  Christianity  in  Gaul,  the  time  of  his  Apostolate  is  challenged  by  modern  investigators.

MEMORIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  7) (5th  cent.)  The  Roman  Martyrology  registers this  Saint  as  "  Nemorius  " ;  popularly  he  is known  as  St.  Mesmin.  He  was  a  deacon  of the  Church  of  Troyes  in  France,  sent  by  the Bishop,  St.  Lupus,  with  several  companions, to  the  camp  of  Attila  the  Hun,  who  was  threatening the  city,  to  beg  of  him  to  spare  it.  The Barbarian  leader,  however,  seized  them  and put  them  all  to  death.  There  are  various accounts  extant  of  the  circumstances  of  this martyrdom,  and  not  all  of  them  are  trustworthy. The  fact  of  the  cultus  of  the  victims  from  the earliest  ages  is  at  least  undoubted.  The  Relics of  St.  Memorius  escaped  the  fury  of  the  Revolutionists of  1792,  and  are  still  in  popular  veneration.

(Sept.  5)  

♦MENEFRIDA  (St.)  V.  (July  24)  
(5th cent.)  Of  the family of  Brychan  of Brecknock.  She  is  the  Patron  Saint  of  Menver (Cornwall). *MENEHOULD  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  14)  
(5th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  the  French town  in  the  Argonne  called  after  her.  With her  five  sisters,  likewise  honoured  as  Saints, she  illustrated  by  her  holy  life  the  Diocese  of Chiaons-sur-Marne. MENELEUS  (MENEVE)  (St.)  Abbot. (July  22)  
(8th  cent.)  In  French  the  name  is  rendered Menele  or  Mauvier.  He  was  a  native  of  the West  of  France,  but  entered  a  monastery  in Auvergne.  Later,  he  founded  a  great  Abbey at  Menat  near  Clermont.  In  his  declining years  he  appointed  as  his  successor  St.  Savinien, a  companion  of  his  youth,  and  died  a.d.  720. MENEUS  and  CAPITO  (SS.)  MM.  (July  24)  
(Date  unknown.)  Beyond  the  fact  that  these Martyrs  are  commemorated  in  the  Greek Menologies,  and  thence  notices  of  them  copied into  the  Western  Martyrologies,  nothing  is  now known  of  them.  Meneus  is  often  written "  Hymenseus." *MENEVIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  22)  
(8th  cent.) A  French  Abbot  in  Auvergne, in  which  Province  and  in  that  of  Anjou,  in which  he  was  born, he  is  in great veneration. *MENGOLD  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  8)  
(9th  cent.) A  Count  of  Huy  on  the  Meuse, 
where  he  is  venerated  as  Patron  Saint.  He 
met  his  death  while  struggling  with  evildoers 
in  the  cause  of  Christian  morality.  

MENIGNUS  (St.)  M.  (March  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Asiatic,  by  trade  a  fuller. He,  in  times  of  persecution,  ministered  to  the suffering  Christians  to  the  utmost  of  his  power. It  is  related  that  in  a.d.  250,  when  the  Decian persecution  broke  out,  Menignus  received  a Divine  inspiration  to  go  before  the  judge  and to  confess  the  Christian  Faith.  This  he  did ; and  was  sentenced  with  the  rest.  After  the usual  scourging,  the  tradition  is  that  his  fingers and  toes  were  cut  off  before  he  was  beheaded. Many miracles wrought  at  his  tomb  in  the 
N  193 

MENNA 
neighbourhood  of  Constantinople  attracted  to it  in  Christian  times  numerous  pilgrims. *MENNA  (MANNA)  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  3)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  in  the country  now  called  Lorraine,  related  by  blood to  St.  Eucharius  and  other  Saints.  The  traditions concerning  the  details  of  her  life  are unfortunately  very  unreliable. MENNAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  25)  
(6th  cent.)  This  holy  Patriarch  of  Constantinople had  the  privilege  of  being  consecrated by  Pope  St.  Agapetus,  who  had  come  to  the city  to  preside  over  the  Council  convoked  to judge  the  former  Patriarch  Anthimus.  On  the deposition  of  the  latter,  Mennas,  then  Superior of  the  great  Hospice  of  St.  Samson,  was  elected in  his  place  (a.d.  536).  Subject  to  Papal approbation,  St.  Mennas  subscribed  the  Edict of  the  Emperor  Justinian  condemning  the documents  known  as  the  "  Three  Chapters." For  this  subscription  St.  Mennas  was,  however, censured  by  Pope  Vigilius.  He  of  course submitted.  He  died  A.d.  552. MENNAS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Egyptian  officer  in  the Imperial  army,  serving  in  Asia  Minor.  On quitting  military  service  he  retired  for  a  time into  the  Desert,  intending  to  embrace  the  life of  the  Solitaries.  Nevertheless,  on  the  breaking out  of  the  great  persecution  under  Diocletian, Mennas  felt  himself  moved  to  share  the  lot  of his  fellow-believers  and,  returning  to  the  town of  Kutahia  in  Phrygia,  publicly  declared  himself a  Christian.  He  was  scourged,  put  to  other torture,  and  beheaded  (a.d.  296).  His  body was  cast  into  a  fire,  but  thence  rescued  by  a fellow-countryman  of  the  Martyr  and  taken  back to  the  Egyptian  desert,  where  it  was  interred and  later  a  church  erected  over  the  grave. MENNAS  (St.)  (Nov.  11)  
(6th  cent.)  A  hermit,  whose  cell  was  situated near  Benevento  in  the  South  of  Italy.  He  led a  life  of  prayer  and  penance,  and  in  life  as  after death  was  looked  upon  by  all  as  a  Saint.  St. Gregory  the  Great,  his  contemporary,  enlarges &  upon  his  virtues,  his  familiarity  with  God's creatures  and  his  wonderful  insight  into  the hearts  of  those  who  had  dealings  with  him. A  solemn  Translation  of  his  Relics  was  celebrated in  A.D.  1094. MENNAS,  HERMOGENES  and  EUGRAPHUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  10)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Mennas,  an  Athenian  by birth,  though  a  Christian,  was  chosen  by Diocletian's  colleague  Galerius  to  take  the command  of  an  expedition  sent  to  quell  an insurrection  in  Egypt.  He  performed  his  duty successfully ;  but  afterwards,  together  with Eugraphus,  his  subordinate,  set  about  spreading Christianity  in  Alexandria  and  its  vicinity. He  made  many  converts,  among  them  Hermogenes,  the  Imperial  Prefect.  Galerius  probably had  not  known  that  Mennas  was  a  Christian. When  he  heard  what  was  passing  in  Egypt (the  Christian  Religion  being  utterly  proscribed at  the  time),  he  ordered  Mennas,  with  Hermogenes  and  Eugraphus,  to  be  arraigned  as Christians  before  the  Criminal  Court  of  Alexandria. All  three  were  in  due  course  sentenced, tortured  and  beheaded. MENODORA,  METRODORA  and  NYMPHODORA (SS.)  VV.MM.  (Sept.  10)  
(4th  cent.)  Three  sisters,  devout  Christians of  the  Province  of  Bithynia  in  Asia  Minor. At  the  time  of  the  great  persecution  under Diocletian,  they  retired  to  an  out-of-the-way place  in  the  interior  of  the  country  ;  but  they were  discovered  and  brought  before  the  local judge,  who  sentenced  them  to  die  because  they despised  the  gods  of  Rome.  They  were  beheaded A.D.  306.  To  shake  the  constancy  of the  two  younger  girls,  the  magistrate  had  the elder  tortured  first  of  the  three,  and  forced  the others  to  gaze  on  the  ghastly  wounds  which 
194 

disfigured  her  torn  body.  And  he  repeated  this piece  of  savagery  in  the  case  of  the  second sister,  thinking  at  least  to  frighten  little  Nymphodora.  But  happily  all  three  were  firm  to  the end  in  their  confession  of  Christ.  It  is  said that  the  child  Nymphodora  did  not  survive the  scourging,  which  was  to  have  been  a  preliminary to  her  execution. *MENULPHUS  (MENOU)  (St.)  Bp.  (July  12)  
(7th cent.)  An Irish Saint who became Bishop  of  Quimper  in  Brittany,  and  died  in  the neighbourhood  of  Bourges  while  on  his  return journey  from  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome. MERCURIA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  12)  

See  SS.  AMMONARIA,  MERCURIA, &c. MERCURIALIS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  23)  
(5th  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Forll  in Central  Italy.  He  attended  the  Council  of Rimini  summoned  in  the  heat  of  the  struggle of  the  Church  with  the  Arians.  He  died  about a.d.  406.  The  records  of  Forli  have  been  again and  again  destroyed  ;  and  there  is  consequently great  uncertainty  as  to  the  trustworthiness of  the  traditional  accounts  of  its  early  Bishops. It  seems,  too,  that  more  than  one  of  these bore  the  name  Mercurialis. MERCURIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  25)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Armenian  soldier  in  the Imperial  army,  who  by  his  bravery  had  secured advancement  to  a  post  of  importance.  His refusing  to  take  part  in  an  idolatrous  ceremony betrayed  him  to  the  authorities  charged  to carry  out  the  edict  of  persecution  promulgated by  Decius.  Mercurius  was  consequently  put to  the  torture  and  beheaded  a.d.  250.  Some of  his  relics  are  venerated  in  churches  in  the South  of  Italy. MERCURIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  10) (4th  cent.)  Sicilian  Martyrs.  They  were soldiers  sent  to  escort  Christian  prisoners, Mercurius  being  the  officer  commanding  the detachment.  The  prisoners  so  impressed  the soldiers  that  they  too  on  arrival  at  Leontium, whither  they  were  bound,  declared  themselves to  be  of  the  same  religion  as  their  charges. All  alike  were  put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded, about  a.d.  320.  The  date  appears  to  require reconsideration,  as  it  is  not  clear  how  Licinius, who  is  named  in  the  Roman  Martyrology  as the  persecuting  Emperor,  could  have  been pursuing  Christians  in  Sicily  so  long  after Constantine  had  guaranteed  toleration  and protection  to  the  Christians  in  the  West. *MEREWENNA  (St.)  V.  (May  13)  
(10th cent.) The Abbess of Rumsey, a monastery reformed under King Edgar the Peaceful.  She  died  about  a.d.  970. *MEREWENNA  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  12)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  Patron  Saint  of Marham  Church,  near  Bude.  She  is  said  to have  been  one  of  the  daughters  of  Brychan  of Brecknock,  and  again,  is  reputed  by  some identical  with  St.  Morwenna,  also  a  daughter of  the  famous  Welsh  chieftain.
♦MERIADEC  (St.)  Bp.  (June  7)  
(14th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Vannes  in  Brittany, famous  for  the  austerity  of  his  life  and  for  his charity  to  the  poor. a.d.  1302  is  the  accepted date  of  his  death. *MERINUS  (St.)  (Jan.  6)  
(6th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  Dunawd  of  Bangor and  Patron  Saint  of  churches  in  Wales  and  also of  others  in  Brittany.
♦MERINUS  (MERRYN,  MEADHRAN)  
(St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  15)  
(7th cent.)  A disciple of St. Congall at 
Benchor,  venerated  as  a  Saint  both  in  Scotland 
and  in  Ireland. He  passed  away  about  a.d.  

620.  

♦MERLILAUN  (MEROLILAUN)  (St.)  M.  (May  18)  
(8th  cent.)  A British Saint  who  met  his 
death  by  violence  near  Rheims  in  France  while 
on  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome,  and  has  since  been 
popularly  venerated  as  a  Martyr.

MERULUS  (St.)  (Jan.  17)  
(6th  cent.)  St.  Gregory  the  Great  says  of 
St. Merulus that he was always in prayer, 
except  for  the  few  moments  he  was  constrained 
to  set  aside  for  sleep  and  for  the  taking  of 
nourishment.  The  same  holy  Pope  mentions 
the  fact  that  St.  Merulus  with  his  fellow  monks, 
SS.  Antony  and  John,  received  from  Almighty 
God  a  revelation  of  the  day  and  hour  in  which 
each  would  be  called  out  of  this  world  to  a  better

See  SS.  CYRIL  and  METHODIUS. METHODIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  14)  
(9th  cent.)  By  birth  a  native  of  Sicily,  he founded  a  monastery  on  the  Island  of  Chio in  the  Grecian  Archipelago.  Summoned  thence to  Constantinople  by  the  Patriarch  Nicephorus, he  endured  much  persecution  from  the  Iconoclasts. On  the  death  of  Nicephorus,  the  Empress Theodora  induced  Methodius  to  accept  the vacant  See,  which  he  occupied  for  four  years. It  is  said  that  so  great  was  the  popular  opinion of  his  sanctity  that  his  Festival  as  a  Saint  began to  be  celebrated  during  the  Episcopate  of  his immediate  successor,  St.  Ignatius.  He  has  left several  works,  among  which  are  a  Book  of Penitential  Canons  and  a  Panegyric  of  St. Dionysius  the  Areopagite.  He  died  A.D. 846. METHODIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.  18)  
(4th  cent.)  According  to  St.  Jerome,  St. Methodius  was  a  Bishop  of  Olympus  in  Lycia (Asia  Minor),  and  thence  translated  to  the  more important  See  of  Tyre  in  Phoenicia.  He  is generally  supposed  to  have  suffered  martyrdom at  Chaleis  in  Greece  about  A.D.  311.  He  was  a profound  Theologian  and  a  polished  writer after  the  style  of  Plato.  His  "  Symposium  " is  avowedly  an  imitation  of  the  "  Banquet " of  the  latter.  In  the  controversies  of  his  time he  showed  himself  a  vigorous  opponent  of  the theories  of  Origen. METRANUS  (METRAS)  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  31)  
(3rd  cent.)  One  of  the  victims  of  the  persecution under  Decius  (a.d.  250).  He  was  an Egyptian  of  Alexandria,  and  St.  Dionysius, his  Bishop  and  contemporary,  describes  in vivid  terms  the  ghastly  tortures  which  preceded his  execution. METROBIUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  24)  

See  SS.  LUCIAN,  METROBIUS,  <fcc. METRODORA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  10)  

See  SS.  MENODORA,  METRODORA, Ac. METROPHANES  (St.)  Bp.  (June  4)  
(4th  cent.)  Believed  to  have  become  Bishop of  Byzantium  about  A.D.  313.  There  is  a tradition  that  the  admiration  cherished  by Constantine  for  his  virtues  and  merits  had  not a  little  to  do  with  the  choice  made  by  that 

Emperor  of  Byzantium,  henceforth  Constantinople, as  the  seat  of  his  government.  St. Metrophanes  had  suffered  imprisonment  during the  persecution  under  Diocletian,  but  his Episcopate  at  Constantinople  was  a  peaceful one.  He  was  unable  on  account  of  his  infirmities to  take  part  in  the  great  Council  of  Nicaea (a.d.  325),  and  died  in  that  same  year. *MEUGANT  (MAWGHAN,  MORGAN)  (Sept.  26)  
(St.)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Saint  to  whom  several  churches in  Wales  and  Cornwall  are  dedicated.  He appears  to  have  been  a  disciple  of  St.  Ultyd, to  have  lived  as  a  hermit  in  several  places  in the  West  of  Britain,  and  to  have  retired  before his  holy  death  to  the  Isle  of  Bardsey.  He  is sometimes  found  represented  as  a  Bishop  with mitre  and  crozier. MEURIS  and  TH/EA  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  19)  
(4th  cent.)  Two  Christian  maidens  who suffered  martyrdom  at  Gaza  in  Palestine  about a.d.  307.  It  is  not  clear  that  these  Saints are  other  than  the  St.  Valentina  and  her  anonymous fellow-sufferer,  commemorated  on  July  25.
♦MEVENNA  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  21)  

Otherwise  St.  MAINE,  which  see. *MEWAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  21)

(Date uncertain.) A Denbighshire Saint, concerning  whom  no  particulars  are  extant. MICHjEAS  (MICAH)  (St.)  Prophet.  (Jan.  15)  
(8th  cent.  B.C.)  A  contemporary  of  the Prophet  Isaias.  One  of  the  Twelve  Minor Prophets.  His  inspired  Book  contains  the prophecy  that  Christ  should  be  born  in  the  town of  Bethlehem.  His  prophecy  is  a  short  one. He  inveighs  both  against  Samaria  and  Jerusalem, but  in  magnificent  imagery  foretells the  glory  of  the  Church  of  the  New  Testament. His  tomb,  according  to  the  historian  Sozomen, was  in  the  fourth  century  discovered  in  the neighbourhood  of  Jerusalem.
♦MICHAEL  CARVALHO  and  OTHERS (March  1)  
(Bl.)  MM.  

(17th  cent.) Portuguese  Jesuits,  missionaries in  Japan,  burned  to  death  there  at  the  stake (A.D.  1624). MICHAEL  (St.)  Bp.  (May  23)  
(9th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Tarasius, Patriarch  of  Constantinople,  by  whom  he  was consecrated  Bishop  of  Synnada  in  Phrygia. St.  Tarasius  also  chose  Michael  as  the  bearer of  his  Synodal  Letter  to  Pope  St.  Leo  III  in Rome.  St.  Michael  was  distinguished  by  his fearless  opposition  to  the  Iconoclast  Emperor Leo  the  Armenian.  He  was  banished  into Galatia,  where  he  went  from  place  to  place spreading  everywhere  the  light  of  the  Faith, in  spite  of  continuous  persecution.  He  died about  a.d.  820. MICHAEL  THE  ARCHANGEL  (St.) (Sept.  29)  

One  of  the  three  Angels  (Michael,  Gabriel, Raphael)  liturgically  venerated  by  Holy  Church. Holy  Scripture  describes  St.  Michael  as  "  one of  the  chief  princes  "  (Dan.  x.  13) ;  and  again as  the  leader  of  the  Heavenly  Host  in  their battle  and  triumph  over  the  forces  of  hell (Apoc.  xii.  7).  He  is  mentioned  also  in  the Epistle  of  St.  Jude  as  "  rebuking  the  devil." He  has  always  been  specially  invoked  by  the Catholic  Church  both  in  the  East  and  in  the West.  A  second  Feast  is  kept  in  his  honour, that  of  his  Apparition  (May  8)  on  Monte  Gargano in  the  South  of  Italy  (fifth  century).  Another Apparition  in  France  (eighth  century)  led  to the  foundation  of  Mont  St.  Michel  in  Brittany. *MIDAN  (NIDAN)  (St.)  (Sept.  30)  
(7th  cent.) An  Anglesey  Saint  who  flourished early  in  the  seventh century.  We have  no reliable  particulars  concerning  him.

Otherwise  St.  MEDANA,  which  see. MIGDONIUS  and  MARDONIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  They  were  high  officials  in  the Imperial  Court,  either  in  that  of  Maximian Herculeus  or  in  that  of  Diocletian.  In  the persecution  (A.D.  300  about),  as  Christians  who refused  to  return  to  heathenism,  they  were sentenced  to  the  death  penalty.  Migdonius was  burned  at  the  stake  and  Mardonius drowned  in  a  well.  A  Christian,  by  name Anthimus,  was  discovered  conveying  a  letter to  them  while  awaiting  trial  in  their  prison at  Nicomedia.  For  this  he  was  stoned  to death. MILBURGA  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  23)  
(7th  cent.)  A  sister  of  St.  Mildred  of  Thanet, she  became  Abbess  of  Wenlock  in  Shropshire. The  old  English  historians  attribute  the  working of  many  miracles  to  St.  Milburga.  She  is  said to  have  survived  till  about  A.D.  722.  Her Abbey,  destroyed  by  the  Danes,  afterwards passed  into  the  possession  of  Cluniac  monks.
♦MILDGITH  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  17)  
(7th  cent.)  The  youngest  and  least  known of  the  three  holy  sisters,  Milburga,  Mildred  and Mildgith.  Mildgith  was  trained  by  her  saintly mother,  Ermenburga,  at  Minster  in  Thanet, and  afterwards  pursued  the  Religious  life  in the  North  of  England.  She  passed  away towards  the  close  of  the  seventh  century.
♦MILDRED  (St.)  V.  (July  13)  
(7th  cent.)  One  of  the  three  daughters  of St.  Ermenburga  (Ebba,  Domneva).  Mildred was  sent  by  her  mother  to  be  educated  in  the convent  of  Chelles  in  France,  and  on  her  return received  the  Religious  habit  from  St.  Theodore, Archbishop  of  Canterbury,  in  St.  Ebba's  monastery of  Minster  in  Thanet,  of  which  at  her mother's  death  she  became  Abbess.  She attended  a  Provincial  Council  in  that  capacity (A.D.  694).  She  died  towards  the  end  of  the century.  Her  relics  were  translated  to  Canterbury (A.D.  1030). MILLES  (St.)  M.  (April  20)  

See  SS.  AZADES,  MILLES,  &c. MILTIADES  (MELCHIADES)  (St.)  (Dec.  10)  

Pope,  M.  

(4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Eusebius  in the  Chair  of  St.  Peter  (a.d.  311).  He  is  honoured as  a  Martyr  on  account  of  his  sufferings in  early  life,  in  the  time  of  Diocletian.  His Pontificate  was  short.  He  witnessed  the  triumph of  Constantine  over  the  usurper  Maxentius (a.d.  312),  and  straightway  set  himself  to  the task  of  reorganising  the  government  of  the Church,  laid  desolate  in  the  long  years  of persecution  then  happily  at  an  end.  He presided  over  $he  Council  of  Bishops  from Italy  and  Gaul,  which  decided  in  favour  of CecUian,  Bishop  of  Carthage,  against  Donatus. This  decision,  however,  did  not  hinder  the later  development  of  the  Donatist  heresy  or schism  in  Africa.  St.  Augustine  describes St.  Miltiades  as  "an  excellent  man,  a  true  son of  peace  and  a  true  father  of  Christians." St.  Miltiades  died  Jan.  10,  a.d.  314. MINERVINUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  31)  

See  SS.  STEPHEN,  PONTIANUS, <fec. MINERVUS,  ELEAZAR  and  OTHERS (Aug.  23)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  The  details  of  the  Passion  of these  Martyrs  are  wanting,  and  those  given  in the  Chronicles  are  uncertain.  It  seems  fairly clear  that  they  suffered  at  Lyons  early  in  the third  century.  With  Minervus  and  Eleazar, eight  Christian  children  are  said  to  have  been put  to  death.  They  are  alleged  to  have  been the  children  of  one  or  other  of  the  two  Martyrs whose  names  have  come  down  to  us.  By  some scholars  St.  Eleazar  (so-called)  is  believed  to have  been  a  woman,  perhaps  the  wife  of  St. Minervus.  In  that  case  we  have  not  the  name in  its  authentic  form.

MINIAS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  25)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  famous  Florentine  Martyr, one  of  the  victims  of  the  Decian  persecution (a.d.  250).  He  was  a  soldier,  and  had  done his  best  to  spread  the  Christian  Faith  among his  comrades.  The  extant  Acts  of  his  Passion describe  the  many  tortures  to  which  he  was subjected  before  execution.  The  Italian  form of  his  name,  San  Miniato,  is  the  more  usual. MIROCLES  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  3)  
(4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Maternus  in the  See  of  Milan,  which  in  his  time  became  an Archbishopric.  He  is  said  to  have  been  the originator  of  the  Ambrosian  Liturgy  and  Chant, afterwards  improved  and  defined  by  the  holy Doctor  whose  name  it  bears.  St.  Mirocles  died a.d.  318.  Both  St.  Ambrose  and  St.  Ennodius of  Pavia  speak  in  terms  of  admiration  of  his life  and  works. MISACH  (MISAEL)  (St.)  (Dec.  16)  

One  of  the  three  Hebrew  youths  cast  into  the 
fiery  furnace  by King  Nabuchodonosor, and 
miraculously delivered unscathed therefrom 
(Dan.  iii.).  

MITRIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  13)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Greek  by  birth,  slave  of  a hard  master  in  the  South  of  Gaul.  The  latter, a  Pagan  and  a  hater  of  Christianity,  ill-used Mitrius  savagely  on  account  of  his  religion. The  cruelty  was  lifelong  for  both,  since  Mitrius quickly  followed  his  persecutor  to  the  tomb (a.d.  314).  St.  Mitrius  is  in  especial  honour  at Aix  in  Provence.  The  French  call  him  SaintMitre,  also  Merre  or  Metre. MNASON  (St.)  (July  12)  

Otherwise  St.  JASON,  which  see. *MOCH^EMHOG (MOCHCEMOC, VULCANIUS, 
PULCHERIUS)  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  13)  
(7th  cent.)  He  was  born  in  Munster  and brought  up  by  his  aunt,  St.  Ita.  He  then became  a  disciple  of  St.  Comgall.  Later  he built  cells  for  his  own  monks  at  Anatrim,  and finally  established  himself  as  head  of  a  community at  Liath.  Great  miracles  are  recorded of  him,  especially  his  having  raised  the  dead to  life.  The  precise  year  of  his  death  is  uncertain. *MOCHELLOC  (CELLOG,  MOTTELOG, 
MOTALOGUS)  (St.)  (March  26)  
(7th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Kilmallock (Limerick). Authentic  particulars  of  his  life are  lacking. *MOCHTEUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  19)  
(5th  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Louth,  to which  See  he  is  said  to  have  been  appointed  by St.  Patrick  himself,  which  would  give  the  fifth century  as  his  date,  though  by  some  he  is  placed a  century  later.  He  would  appear  to  have  been born  either  in  England  or  in  Scotland.  St. Adamnan  styles  him  a  "  Briton." *MOCHUA  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  1)

Otherwise  St.  CARTHAGE  THE  YOUNGER, which  see.
♦MODAN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  4)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Abbot  of  Mailros  who  preached the  Faith  in  Stirling  and  at  Falkirk,  retiring  in his  old  age  to  a  solitude  near  Dumbarton. *MODANIC  (St.)  (Nov.  14)  
(Date  unknown.) A  Scottish  Bishop  whose Feast  as  a  Saint  was  kept  at  Aberdeen,  but  of whom  we  have  no  reliable  particulars.
♦MODERAN  (MORAN)  (St.)  (Oct.  22)  
(8th  cent.) A  saintly  Bishop  of  Rennes  in 
Brittany  who  renounced  Ms  See  and,  passing 
into  Italy,  finished  his  life  as  a  hermit  in  the 
Apennines  (a.d.  730).  

MODESTA  (St.)  M.  (March  13)  

See  SS.  MACEDONIUS,  PATRICIA, &c. MODESTA  (St.)  V.  (Nov.  4)  
(7th cent.) A great deal of controversy exists  about  the  identity  of  this  holy  Abbess, 
MONICA 

but  the  most  probable  opinion  is  that  she  was closely  allied  with  St.  Gertrude  of  Nivelle,  and that  she  was  the  first  Abbess  of  (Ereo  (Horren) at  Treves,  the  monastery  founded  by  St.  Modoald.  The  name  of  St.  Modesta  appears  in numerous  Litanies,  local  Martyrologies,  &c, and  she  is  specially  venerated  in  the  Diocese of  Treves.  She  seems  to  have  died  about a.d.  680  and  to  have  been  succeeded  at  Horren by  St.  Erminia,  daughter  of  King  Dagobert.  

MODESTUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  12)  

See  SS.  ZOTICUS,  ROGATUS,  Ac.  

MODESTUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  12)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  of  the  persecution under  Diocletian  (about  a.d.  304),  either  at Beneventum  in  Italy,  or,  as  others  maintain, in  Rome  itself.  The  ancient  Lections  read  in his  Festival  Office  describe  him  as  a  deacon,  by birth  a  native  of  Sardinia  ;  and  add  that,  after enduring  much  torture,  he  was  scalded  to death  by  being  thrown  into  a  bath  of  boiling 
MODESTUS  and  JULIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  12)  
(Date  unknown.)  St.  Modestus  is  described as  a  Carthaginian  Martyr.  He  has  been  chosen as  the  Patron  Saint  of  Cartagena  in  Spain. St.  Julian,  according  to  the  best  authorities, suffered  at  Alexandria  in  Egypt.  Why  they are  associated  in  the  Martyrologies  is  not apparent.  

MODESTUS  and  AMMONIUS  (SS.)  MM. (Feb.  12)  
(Date  unknown.) Martyrs  at  Alexandria  in 
Egypt.  They are said to have been mere 
children.  Nothing  is  really  now  known  about 
them.  

MODESTUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  24)  
(5th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Miletus  in the  See  of  Treves  (a.d.  486).  He  had  a  difficult task  to  perform  in  restoring  the  discipline  and morals  of  his  flock,  which  had  been  utterly disorganised  by  the  incursions  of  the  Pagan Franks.  His  zeal  and  success  are  subjects of  admiration  among  contemporary  historians. He  passed  away  a.d.  489.

♦MODOALD  (St.)  Bp.  (May  12)  
(7th  cent.)  Archbishop  of  Treves  from a.d.  622  to  a.d.  640.  He  had  previously  been at  the  Court  of  the  Merovingian  King  Dagobert ; and,  as  Archbishop,  one  of  his  achievements was  the  conversion  of  the  monarch  from  a  life of  dissipation  to  one  conformable  to  Christian principles.  His  Diocese  prospered  greatly  under his  administration.  When  he  died  (a.d.  640) his  remains  were  laid  by  the  side  of  those  of  his sister,  St.  Severa  (an  Abbess  at  Autun)  in  the Abbey  Church  of  the  latter.  

♦MODOC  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  31)  

Otherwise  St.  ^EDAN  of  FERNS,  which  see.  

♦MODOMNOCK  (DOMNOC)  (St.)  (Feb.  13)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who,  with  others, became  a  disciple  of  St.  David  in  Wales.  Returning to  his  own  country,  he  lived  a  holy  life as  a  hermit  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Kilkenny. He  fell  asleep  in  Christ  a.d.  550.  

♦MODWENNA  (St.)  V.  (July  5)  
(9th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who,  coming  to England,  founded  the  Abbey  of  Polesworth  in Warwickshire.  Most  probably  she  flourished in  the  ninth  century,  but  there  is  much confusion  in  Ecclesiastical  history  between  her and  other  holy  women  of  the  same  or  similar name.  

♦MOZLIAI  (M03LRAY)  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  23)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  baptised  by St.  Patrick,  and  by  him  set  over  the  newly founded  monastery  of  Nendrum,  where  he  had SS.  Finnian  and  Colman  among  his  disciples. He  died  about  a.d.  493.  

♦MOGUE  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  11)  

Otherwise  St.  MACDOGH-^EDAN,  ivhich  see. 

♦MOLAGGA  (LAICIN)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  20)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  brought  up  in Wales  under  the  discipline  of  St.  David.  He founded  a  monastery  at  Fulachmhin  (Fermoy). He  was  distinguished  for  his  exceptional  learning as  well  as  for  his  piety  and  for  his  Christian charity.  He  seems  to  have  survived  the  great pestilence  of  a.d.  664.  He  is  much  venerated in  the  South  of  Ireland.  There  are  several Saints  of  the  same  name  (Irish  Hagiologists enumerate  no  less  than  twelve),  and  it  is  often difficult  to  disentangle  their  Acts.  

♦MOLAISRE  (St.)  Bp.  (April  18)  

Otherwise  St.  LASERIAN,  which  see.  

♦MOLLING  (MYLLIN)  (St.)  Bp.  (June  17)  
(7th  cent.)  Born  in  Wexford,  he  became  a monk  at  Glendalough.  Later,  he  succeeded St.  iEdan  in  the  Bishopric  of  Ferns,  but  resigned his  See  some  years  before  his  death,  which  took place  June  17,  a.d.  697.  Giraldus  calls  St. Patrick,  St.  Columba,  St.  Moiling,  and  St. Braccan,  the  "  Four  Prophets  of  Ireland." 
♦MOLOC  (St.)  Bp.  (June  25)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  disciple  of  St. Brendan,  who  passed  over  to  Scotland,  the field  of  his  labours  for  Christ.  He  lived  chiefly in  the  Hebrides.  His  memory  is  also  associated with  that  of  St.  Boniface  of  Ross.  He  was consecrated  Bishop,  but  to  what  See  is  not  clear. Throughout  his  life,  he  was  famous  for  his missionary  zeal.  a.d.  592  is  given  as  the  probable date  of  his  death.  

♦MOLONACHUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  25)  
(7th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Brendan  who became  Bishop  of  Lismore  in  Argyle.  Little or  nothing  is  now  known  about  him.  

♦MOLUA  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  4)  

Otherwise  St.  LUANUS,  which  see.  

♦MONACELLA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  31)  

Otherwise  St.  MELANGELL,  which  see.  

♦MONAN  (St.)  M.  (March  1)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Saint  trained  up  by  St.  Adrian of  St.  Andrews,  and  a  missionary  in  the  country about  the  Firth  of  Forth.  With  six  thousand other  Christians  he  was  slain  by  the  heathen Danes  (a.d.  874).  His  shrine  was  famous  for the  miracles  wrought  there.  

MONAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  12)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  native  of  Milan  who  in  his youth  attracted  the  attention  of  the  Archbishop St.  Callimerus.  The  latter  trained  him  for  the priesthood,  with  the  hope  that  Monas  might one  day  succeed  to  his  own  See.  This  wish was  realised,  it  is  said,  by  a  miraculous  intervention at  the  moment  of  the  election.  Monas gathered  together  his  flock,  scattered  by  the persecutions  so  frequent  and  so  ruthless  of  the third  century,  organised  parishes,  and  converted numberless  Pagans  to  Christianity.  The conjectural  conversion  of  the  Emperor  Philip is  affirmed  by  the  biographers  of  St.  Monas, and  attributed  to  his  prayers  and  wholesome influence.  He  died  after  fifty-nine  years  of Episcopate,  March  25,  A.D.  249.  

MONEGUNDIS  (St.)  (July  2)  
(6th  cent.)  A  pious  woman  of  Chartres (France),  who  on  the  death  of  her  two  children, with  the  consent  of  her  husband,  betook  herself to  a  hermitage,  where  she  spent  the  rest  of  her life  in  the  practices  of  prayer,  self-denial  and work  for  the  good  of  others.  Round  her deathbed  (a.d.  570)  were  gathered  several pious  women  who  had  adopted  her  mode  of life.  Mention  is  made  of  her  as  a  Saint  by  her contemporary,  St.  Gregory  of  Tours.  

♦MONESSA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  4)  
(5th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  an  Irish  chieftain, converted  by  St.  Patrick.  The  tradition is  that  on  coming  out  of  the  Baptismal  Font she  straightway  winged  her  way  to  Heaven (A.D.  456).  

MONICA  (St.)  Widow.  (May  4)  
(4th cent.)  The saintly mother of St.  

Augustine  of  Hippo,  who  owed  his  conversion 
197 

MONINNA 
from  a  life  of  error  and  dissipation  to  Christianity and  high  sanctity  to  her  prayers  and  tears. She  was  of  Christian  parentage  in  Africa,  though married  to  a  Pagan,  whom,  however,  she  had the  comfort  to  see  die  a  Christian.  She  accompanied her  son  and  his  fellow-converts  to  Italy, where  she  superintended  their  quasi-monastic establishment.  In  her  old  age  she  was  seized with  a  longing  to  return  to  her  native  Africa. On  the  way,  at  the  port  of  Ostia,  she  fell  mortally ill  and  expired  there  May  4,  a.d.  387,  in  the presence  of  her  son.  Most  people  will  remember the  pathetic  words  in  which  St.  Augustine  in  his "  Confessions  "  enlarges  on  his  mother's  virtues and  describes  the  manner  of  her  passing  away.  

♦MONINNA  (St.)  V.  (July  6)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  of  Sliabh  Cuillin, where  she  closed  a  saintly  life  with  a  happy death,  a.d.  518.  

MONITOR  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  10)  
(5th  cent.)  The  twelfth  Bishop  of  Orleans. He  flourished  towards  the  end  of  the  fifth century.  He  is  always  described  as  a  Saint in  the  Orleans  documents,  but  nothing  further is  recorded  of  him.  His  relics  were  transferred to  the  Abbey  of  St.  Aignan,  under  King  Robert of  France,  a.d.  1029.  

♦MONON  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  18)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Scottish  Saint  who crossed  over  to  the  Continent  and  lived  as  a hermit  in  the  Forest  of  the  Ardennes,  where  he was  done  to  death  by  men  of  evil  life.  He  is famous  for  miracles.  

MONTANUS,  LUCIUS,  JULIAN,  VICTORIOUS, FLAVIAN  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  24) (3rd  cent.)  Some  of  the  many  Christians, disciples  of  St.  Cyprian  of  Carthage,  who  were put  to  death  during  the  fierce  persecution  of Christianity  under  the  Emperor  Valerian  (a.d. 259).  The  story  of  their  imprisonment  is  told by  themselves,  and  that  of  their  martyrdom  by eye-witnesses.  

MONTANUS  (St.)  M.  (June  17)  
(4th  cent.)  Some  have  thought  that  this Martyr,  a  Christian  soldier,  suffered  under Hadrian  in  the  second  century,  but  the  opinion now  prevails  that  he  was  one  of  the  victims  of the  fury  of  Diocletian.  He  was,  after  a  period of  imprisonment,  taken  over  to  the  Island  of Ponza,  and  there  thrown  into  the  sea,  with  a heavy  stone  tied  round  his  neck.  The  Christians recovered  his  body  and  enshrined  it  at  Gaeta.  

♦MORE  (THOMAS)  (Bl.)  M.  (July  6)  

See  Bl.  THOMAS  MORE.  

♦MOROC  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  8)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Dunblane  in  Scotland who  appears  to  have  left  his  name  to several  churches,  and  who  was  venerated  with a  solemn  Office  in  the  old  Scottish  Rite.  

♦MORWENNA  (St.)  V.  (July  8)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Cornish  Saint  to  whom  we owe  some  place-names.  She  is  often  confused with  St.  Modwenna,  who  flourished  two  centuries later.  There  is  also  an  Irish  Saint  Monynna, and  in  her  case  also  the  similarity  of  names  has led  to  mistakes.  

MOSES  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Arab  by  birth  who  retired into  the  Desert  about  Mount  Sinai,  and  became renowned  far  and  wide  for  his  virtues  and  for the  miraculous  answers  to  his  prayers  he obtained.  He  was  raised  to  the  Episcopate with  the  charge  of  an  Arab  flock.  After  converting many  Pagans  and  being  the  instrument of  the  preservation  of  peace  between  his  people and  the  Romans,  he  passed  away  a.d.  372.  

MOSES  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  14)  

See  SS.  AGATHO,  CYRIO, <fec.  

MOSES  (St.)  (Aug.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  He  was  an  African  Negro  of Abyssinia,  and  hence  is  styled  the  "  Ethiopian Hermit."  Born  in  slavery,  he  had  developed such  vicious  inclinations  that  his  master  drove him  from  his  household.  He  then  became  a 198 

highway  robber,  and,  at  the  head  of  a  band  of brigands,  was  the  terror  of  the  country  round the  frontiers  of  Egypt.  But  a  miraculous conversion  ensued.  Touched  by  Divine  Grace, Moses  became  a  model  of  penitence,  and  after some  time  gained  admittance  to  the  monastery of  the  Solitaries  at  Scete  in  Lower  Egypt. There,  his  austere  life  and  the  heavenly  favours he  received  placed  him  in  the  first  rank  among the  Fathers  of  the  Desert.  Theophilus,  Patriarch of  Alexandria,  raised  him  to  the  priesthood. He  died  at  the  close  of  the  fourth  century, when  in  his  seventy-fifth  year,  surrounded  by his  many  disciples.  

MOSES  (St.)  Patriarch.  (Sept.  4)  
(12th  cent.  B.C.)  The  Hebrew  leader  and lawgiver.  What  we  know  of  him  we  learn from  the  inspired  text  of  Holy  Scripture, especially  from  the  Book  of  Exodus.  He  died at  the  age  of  one  hundred  and  twenty  years, on  the  borders  of  the  Promised  Land.  Where he  was  buried  no  man  knows.  The  Epistle  of St.  Jude  speaks  of  the  altercation  of  the  devil with  St.  Michael  concerning  the  body  of  Moses. He  is  one  of  the  few  Saints  of  the  Old  Law whom  the  Catholic  Church  includes  by  name  in her  Kalendars  and  Martyrologies.  

MOSES  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  25)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  priest,  of  such  worldwide renown  as  a  champion  of  the  Faith  that even  from  Carthage  St.  Cyprian  addressed  to him  a  letter  full  of  praise  and  encouragement, which  he  received  while  in  prison  on  the  charge of  leading  Romans  astray  from  the  worship  of the  gods.  On  this  occasion  he  was  after  a  time released,  and  soon  after  we  find  Pope  St.  Cornelius commending  him  for  his  zeal  in  converting idolaters  and  in  confuting  the  crafty  subtleties of  the  Novatian  heretics.  He  was  again arrested  and  imprisoned,  and  in  fine  gained  the crown  of  martyrdom.  He  was  beheaded  a.d.  251.  

MOSEUS  and  AMMONIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  18) (3rd  cent.)  Two  Christian  soldiers  arrested as  Christians  in  the  Province  of  Pontus  in  the Decian  persecution  (a.d.  250).  Their  sentence was  at  first  only  to  forced  labour  for  life  in  the mines  ;  but  it  appears  to  have  been  revised by  the  Imperial  authorities,  and  they  were adjudged  to  undergo  capital  punishment,  like the  greater  part  of  their  co-religionists.  They were  burned  alive  in  the  following  year.  

MOUNT  ARARAT  (MARTYRS  of)  (June  22)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  uncertain.)  The  tradition  exists  that In  one  of  the  old  persecutions  under  the  Roman Emperors,  ten  thousand  of  the  Faithful  won  the Crown  of  Martyrdom  in  a  general  massacre  of Christians  in  the  country  round  Mount  Ararat in  Armenia.  But  no  reliable  record  of  their sufferings  now  exists.  

MOYSETES  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  18)  
(Date  unknown.)  An  African  Martyr.  He probably  was  one  of  the  victims  of  the  persecution under  Decius  (a.d.  250).

See  SS.  PARMENIUS,  HELIMANAS, &c.  

MUCIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  13)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  at  Constantinople, where  the  Emperor  Constantine  built  a  church over  his  tomb.  He  was  a  native  of  that  city, born  of  Christian  parents  who  had  come  thither to  settle  from  Rome.  He  became  a  priest, and  in  his  zeal  is  said  to  have  overturned  a Pagan  altar,  scattering  the  offerings  on  the ground.  This,  it  appears,  whether  the  accusation was  true  or  false,  occurred  at  Heraclea, and  entailed  the  death  penalty.  He  was  put to  the  torture  and  beheaded  in  Constantinople itself  (a.d.  311).  Several  Odes  and  Canticles in  honour  of  St.  Mucius  were  composed  by  the Greeks,  and  some  of  them  are  still  sung  in  their churches.

(3rd  cent.) A  priest  in  charge  of  a  church  in 

Greece.  At  the  coming  of  Imperial  officers, under  Decius  (a.d.  250),  to  wreck  the  sacred building  and  arrest  such  Christians  as  they might  find  about  it,  Myron  boldly  faced  them and  made  his  protest  against  the  iniquitous law  of  the  Pagan  Emperor.  The  Saint  was subjected  to  torture  on  the  spot,  but  was  sent for  execution  to  Cyzicus  on  the  Sea  of  Marmora.  

MYROPE  (St.)  M.  (July  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  woman,  native  of the  Island  of  Chio  in  the  Grecian  Archipelago, whence  she  used  to  make  pilgrimages  to  the shrines  of  the  Martyrs  and  other  holy  places.

NABOR  and  FELIX  (SS.)  MM.  (July  12)  
(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  under  Diocletian  at Milan,  about  A.D.  304.  They  owe  their  celebrity in  the  Universal  Church  to  their  solemn Translation  and  enshrinement  by  the  great St.  Ambrose,  nearly  a  century  later.  

NAHUM  (St.)  Prophet.  (Dec.  1)  
(7th  cent.  B.o.)  One  of  the  Minor  Prophets, supposed  to  have  been  a  native  of  Northern Palestine.  His  short  prophecy  of  three  chapters is  directed  against  Ninive,  the  great  city  of  the Assyrians,  by  whom  his  compatriots  of  the Ten  Tribes  were  shortly  after  led  into  captivity. He  lived  to  see  come  to  pass  the  destruction  of Ninive,  which  he  had  foretold.  

NAMPHARION  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  4) (2nd  cent.)  African  Martyrs,  so  celebrated in  ancient  times  that  St.  Nampharion  (the  name is  of  Punic  or  Carthaginian  derivation)  was styled  the  Arch-Martyr,  and  reputed  one  of  the first  who  suffered  for  the  Faith  in  Africa  (perhaps a.d.  180).

♦NAPOLEON  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  victims  of  the  persecution under  Diocletian  at  the  beginning  of  the fourth  century.  He  appears  to  have  been  an Egyptian,  and  to  have  suffered  at  Alexandria. He  was  put  to  the  torture,  and  so  horribly maimed  thereby  that  he  expired  while  being carried  back  to  his  dungeon.

(4th  cent.)  A  holy  Bishop  and  his  deacon, who  were  put  to  death  together  as  Christians at  Gerona  in  Catalonia  (Spain),  in  the  persecution under  Diocletian,  about  a.d.  303.  St. Narcissus  is  also  famous  at  Augsburg  (Germany) and  in  Switzerland,  as  having,  while  preaching in  those  parts,  brought  about  the  conversion of  the  celebrated  penitent  St.  Afra.  

NARCISSUS  and  CRESCENTIO  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  1 7) (3rd  cent.)  These  Saints  were  among  the victims  of  the  Decian  persecution  continued under  the  Emperor  Valerian  (a.d.  254-261). Narcissus  was  a  Christian  in  whose  house  many of  the  Faithful  had  found  a  refuge,  and  one  of those  charged  by  St.  Laurence  with  the  distribution of  the  moneys  of  the  Church  to  the

poor.  Crescentio  was  a  blind  man,  to  whom by  a  miracle  St.  Laurence  gave  back  his  sight. The  little  we  know  of  either  is  drawn  from  the Acts  of  St.  Laurence  compiled  from  oral  tradition.  

NARCISSUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  29)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Jerusalem,  an account  of  some  of  whose  miracles  is  given  by the  historian  Eusebius.  St.  Narcissus  is  said to  have  been  considerably  more  than  one hundred  years  old  when  he  died.  Though already  in  his  eightieth  year  when  made  Bishop, he  was  energetic  as  a  Pastor  of  souls,  and  even (a.d.  195)  presided  over  a  Council  of  the  Bishops of  Palestine.

She  had  been a  servant  in  the  household  of  the  Martyr  St. Hadrian  (Sept.  8),  and  the  loyal  service  she rendered  him  in  prison  and  in  the  torture chamber  is  touchingly  narrated  in  his  Acts.
♦NATALIS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  27)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Founder  of  monasticism  in the  Northern  parts  of  Ireland,  and  associated with  St.  Columba.  St.  Natalis  ruled  the  Abbeys of  Cill,  Naile  and  Daunhinis.  His  holy  well  is still  venerated. *NATHALAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  8)

♦NATHY  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  9)  
(6th  cent.)  Son  of  a  chieftain  in  Connaught and  disciple  of  St.  Finnian  of  Clonard.  He founded  a  monastery  at  Achonry  and  was consecrated  Bishop.  He  was  famous  for  his austerity  of  life  but  much  more  for  his  loving kindness  to  the  poor.  He  died  at  a  great  age about  a.d.  600. NAVALIS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  16)

(1st  cent.)  St.  Nazarius's  father  was  a heathen ;  but  his  Christian  mother,  Perpetua was  probably  a  disciple  of  St.  Peter.  Leaving Rome,  the  Saint  went  to  Milan,  where,  under Nero,  he  was  beheaded  with  his  companion, the  youth  Celsus,  about  a.d.  60.  Their  bodies, separately  buried,  were  discovered  by  St.  Ambrose (a.d.  395),  and  in  the  tomb  of  St.  Nazarius, a  vial  of  blood,  fresh  as  if  recently  shed. *NEACHTAIN  (St.)  (May  2)  
(5th  cent.) A  near  kinsman  of  St.  Patrick, at  whose  holy  death,  according  to  tradition,  the Saint  was  present. The  memory  of  St.  Neachtain  has  always  been  held  in  much  veneration. 200 

♦NECTAN  (St.)  M.  (June  17)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Hartland  in Devonshire.  He  was  one  of  the  descendants of  the  famous  prince,  Brychan  of  Brecknock. The  circumstances  of  his  death,  which  have justified  his  being  accounted  a  Martyr,  are  not now  known. *NELSON  (JOHN)  (Bl.)  M.  (Feb.  3)

(3rd  cent.)  African  Bishops,  seized  in  the persecution  under  Valerian,  scourged  and  otherwise tortured,  finally  condemned  to  servitude in  the  mines  (a.d.  260).  In  the  works  of  St. Cyprian  will  be  found  a  magnificent  and  consoling Epistle  addressed  by  that  Holy  MartyrBishop  to  these  his  suffering  brethren. NEMESIS  (St.)  M  (Feb.  20)  

See  SS. SYMPHOROSA  and  HER  CHILDREN. NEMESIS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  19)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Egyptian,  one  of  the  Martyrs at  Alexandria  under  Decius  (a.d.  250).  He suffered  about  the  same  time  as  St.  Macarius (Dec.  8),  and,  to  make  his  Passion  more  humiliating, he  was  burned  at  the  stake  between  two thieves.  Eusebius  the  historian  had  these  and other  particulars  from  an  account  written  by St.  Dionysius,  Patriarch  of  Alexandria,  contemporary of  the  Martyrs. NEMESIUS  (St.)  (Aug.  1)  
(Date  uncertain.) A Saint  venerated  near Lisieux in  the  North  jof  France,  but  of  whose life  we  have  no  reliable  account. NEMESIUS  and  LUCILLA  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  25)  
(3rd  cent.)  Nemesius,  a  Roman  deacon, with  his  daughter  Lucilla,  was  among  the Christians  put  to  death  in  Rome  by  the  Emperor Valerian  (a.d.  254-260).  Various  Popes  interested themselves  in  the  fitting  enshrinement of  their  sacred  remains.  Hence,  separate commemoration  is  made  of  them  in  the  Martyr ologies. NEMORIUS  (MEMORIUS,  MESMIN)  and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  7)  
(5th  cent.)  A  deacon  of  Troyes  in  France, who  was  cruelly  put  to  death  by  Atilla  the  Hun when  ravaging  Gaul  (a.d  451).  With  him suffered  many  other  inoffensive  Christians. The  prayers  of  Bishop  St.  Lupus  safeguarded his  city  of  Troyes,  and  soon  after  the  Roman General  iEtius  happily  destroyed  the  army  of the  Huns  in  the  Plains  of  Chalons.

(9th  cent.)  Tradition  tells  us  that  St.  Neot was  a  monk  at  Glastonbury  Abbey  who  lived in  the  ninth  century ;  that  he  was  a  councillor of  King  Alfred,  and  that  he  retired  to  a  hermitage in  Cornwall,  where  he  gathered  round him  a  small  band  of  disciples.  His  remains, it  is  further  said,  were  afterwards  translated  to the  place  called  St.  Neots  in  Huntingdonshire. NEOTERIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  8)  

See  SS.  AMMON,  THEOPHILUS, &c. NEREUS  and  ACHILLEUS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  12) (1st cent.)  Two famous Roman Martyrs, baptised  by  St.  Peter  the  Apostle,  and  household servants  of  the  noble  lady  St.  Flavia  Domitilla. With  her  they  were  banished  as  Christians  to the Isle of Ponza.  Ultimately they  were beheaded  under  Trajan,  about  a.d.  100.  Unfortunately, the  extant  Acts  of  these  Saints  are far  from  reliable. NEREUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  16)

NESTOR  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (March  4)  

See  SS.  BASIL,  EUGENIUS,  &c.  

NESTOR  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  8)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  Martyrs  at  Gaza  in 
Palestine  under  the  apostate  Emperor  Julian.  

He  was  quite  a  youth  and  showed  himself  a 
veritable  hero  in  the  torture-chamber.  While 
being  dragged  half-dead  with  the  others  to  the 
place  of  execution,  outside  the  city  walls,  the 
crowd,  moved  by  a  sort  of  pity,  insisted  rather 
on  his  being  left  to  die  by  the  wayside.  There, 
he  was  found  by  Christians  and  given  shelter.  

But  while  being  tended  he  expired  (a.d.  362).  

NESTOR  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  8)  
(4th cent.) A youthful Martyr at Thes
salonica,  at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century, 
under  Diocletian. A  singular  tale  concerning 
his  voluntarily  undertaking  a  gladiatorial  fight 
in  the  Arena  is  given  in  the  Greek  Acts,  but 
there  is  no  need  to  accept  it. His  cult  was 
from  the  outset  far  spread  in  the  East,  and  it 
was  only  much  later  that  it  was  extended  to  the 
Western  Church.  

♦NEWDIGATE  (SEBASTIAN)  (Bl.)  M.  (June  18)

(5th  cent.)  A  holy  Bishop  mentioned  by several  ancient  writers  as  presiding  over  the See  of  "  Romatia,"  a  place  unknown,  but  which is  now  supposed  to  be  another  name  for  Aquileia in  Upper  Italy,  near  the  Adriatic.  St.  Nicaeus  is further  thought  to  be  the  Nicseus  addressed  to whom  are  Epistles  from  St.  Jerome  and  St. Leo  the  Great,  a.d.  458  is  sometimes  given  as the  year  of  his  death. NIC^US  and  PAUL  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  29)  
(Date uncertain.) Set down as  Syrian Martyrs who suffered at Antioch. Nothing more  is  now  known  of  them. NICANDER  (St.)  M.  (March  15)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Martyr  at  the beginning  of  the  fourth  century  under  Diocletian. He  had  previously  distinguished himself  by his  charity  in  ministering  to  his 

brethren  in  prison  and  by  his  diligence  in collecting  and  honourably  interring  the  remains of  those  who  had  died  for  Christ.  He  was, according  to  custom,  put  to  frightful  torture before  being  beheaded. NICANDER  and  MARCIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (June  17) (2nd  cent.)  Martyrs  in  the  South  of  Italy. They  appear  to  have  been  officers  in  the  Imperial army,  or,  as  others  say,  high  civil  functionaries. The  date  of  their  death  is  also  much  disputed. Some  put  it  as  late  as  the  reign  of  Diocletian (a.d.  300  or  thereabouts).  With  the  Bollandists we  give  a.d.  173  as  the  more  likely  year  of 
NICANDER  and  HERMAS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  4)  
(Date  uncertain.)  St.  Nicander  was  a  Bishop 
and  St.  Hermas  a  priest.  They  were  put  to 
death  at  Myra  in  Lycia  (Asia  Minor).  Nothing

NICANOR  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  10)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Jew  by  birth,  one  of  the  seven deacons  chosen  by  the  Apostles  (Acts  vi.  5). The  tradition  is  that  after  the  stoning  of  St. Stephen,  their  chief,  they  dispersed  and  went as  missionaries  among  the  Gentiles.  St. Nicanor  came  to  Cyprus,  where,  years  afterwards, under  Vespasian  (a.d.  76  about),  he  suffered death  for  Christ.

NICASIUS, QUIRINUS, SCUBICULUS and 
PIENTIA  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Nicasius,  a  Bishop,  is  said to  have  been  one  of  the  first  missionaries  sent from  Rome  to  the  Pagans  of  the  North  of  France, where  he,  with  the  others  enumerated  above, was  put  to  death  as  a  Christian.  As  in  many other  cases,  there  is  a  great  doubt  as  to  whether the  old  tradition  that  these  and  other  holy missionaries  came  into  Gaul  in  the  Apostolic Age  or  centuries  later  can  be  maintained.  The Bollandists  prefer  a.d.  286  as  the  date  of  the martyrdom  of  St.  Nicasius.  

NICASIUS,  EUTROPIA  and  OTHERS  (Dec.  14) (SS.)  MM.  

(5th  cent.)  St.  Nicasius  was  a  Bishop  of Rheims  and  had  with  him  his  sister  Eutropia. All  agree  that  they,  with  a  multitude  of  other Christians,  suffered  death  at  the  hands  of Barbarian  invaders  of  Gaul ;  but  some  would date  their  martyrdom  as  early  as  a.d.  407, while  others,  with  greater  probability,  maintain that  it  took  place  nearly  half  a  century  later at  the  time  of  the  inroad  of  the  Huns.  

NICEPHORUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  9)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Syrian  Christian  put  to  death for  his  Faith  at  Antioch  under  the  Emperor Valerian,  a.d.  260.  This  is  the  holy  Martyr of  whom  it  is  related  in  an  official  account  by contemporaries  that  he  took  the  place  of  Sapricius,  who,  through  unwillingness  to  forgive Nicephorus  some  injury,  lost  the  grace  of fortitude  and  apostatised  before  the  heathen Judge  who  was  trying  him  as  a  Christian. St.  Nicephorus  then  of  his  own  accord  came forward  and  received  the  Martyr's  crown forfeited  by  the  other.

NICEPHORUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (March  13)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Patriarch  of  Constantinople who  sacrificed  himself  in  defence  of  the  practice of  the  veneration  of  pictures  and  statues  during the  persecution  under  the  Emperor  Leo  the Armenian.  He  died  in  exile  in  the  fifteenth year  of  his  banishment,  a.d.  828.  

NICERAS  (St.)  V.  (Dec.  27)  
(5th  cent.)  A  devout  woman  of  Constantinople, so  intent  on  good  works  that  the historian  Sozomen  writes  of  her  that  he  knew  of no  woman  of  his  time  who  surpassed  her  in

NICETA 
virtue.  Loyal  to  St.  John  Chrysostom,  she left  Constantinople  when  he  was  banished  from his  See,  and  seems  to  have  died  in  exile  early in  the  fifth  century.  

NICETA  and  AQUILINA  (SS.)  MM.  (July  24)  
(Date  uncertain.)  All  that  we  know  of  these sufferers  for  Christ  is  drawn  from  the  traditional account  of  St.  Christopher.  They  were  two women  in  Lycia  (Asia  Minor)  converted  from  an evil  life  as  heathens  to  Christianity  by  the holy  Martyr,  and  were  soon  themselves  privileged to  die  for  their  Faith.  

NICETAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  in  Dacia  (by  which would  be  meant  a  district  bordering  on  the Lower  Danube),  remarkable  for  his  missionary zeal.  He  was  also  in  his  age  famous  for  his learning  and  eloquence.  He  assisted  at  the Council  of  Capua  (a.d.  392).  By  many  moderns he  is  reputed  the  author  of  the  incomparable Hymn,  Te  Deum  laudamus.  

NICETAS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  20)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Bishop  in  Asia  Minor,  one  of those  who,  in  defence  of  the  Catholic  practice of  venerating  the  pictures  and  statues  of  the Saints,  suffered  persecution  and  exile.  He  died about  A.D.  735.  

NICETAS  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  3)  
(9th  cent.)  He  governed  a  monastery  at the  foot  of  Mount  Olympus  in  Bithynia,  and endured  a  long  imprisonment  in  the  cause  of the  Sacred  Images  ;  but  after  the  death  of  the wretched  Emperor  Leo  the  Armenian,  he returned  to  die  in  peace  in  a  hermitage  near Constantinople  (a.d.  824).  

NICETAS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Goth,  one  of  the  victims  of  the fury  of  King  Athanaric,  who  ruled  towards the  end  of  the  fourth  century  over  those  of the  nation  then  settled  about  the  Danube.  He had  been  converted  to  Christianity  by  the celebrated  Ulphilas,  translator  of  the  Bible  into the  Gothic  language.  St.  Nicetas  was  burned to  death  about  a.d.  378.  

NICETIUS  (NIZIER)  (St.)  Bp.  (April  2)  
(6th  cent.) For  twenty  years  Archbishop  of 
Lyons.  He  died  a.d.  577,  and  many  miracles 
worked  at  his  tomb  have  borne  witness  to  his 
eminent  sanctity.  

NICETIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  5)  
(6th  cent.)  A  French  Benedictine  monk  who became  Archbishop  of  Treves  and  distinguished himself  by  his  courage  in  rebuking  the  semibarbarous  princes  of  his  time  for  their  crimes and  cruelty. He  died  a.d.  570.  

NICETUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  5)  
(4th  cent.) The  fifteenth  Bishop  of  Vienne 
in  Gaul.  Little  or  nothing  is  now  known  of  him.  

♦NICHOLAS  of  FLUE  (Bl.)  Hermit.  (March  21) (15th  cent.)  A  holy  man  in  Switzerland who  at  the  death  of  his  wife  retired  to  a  hermit's cell  and  passed  the  last  twenty  years  of  his  life in  solitude.  He  died  March  21,  a.d.  1487,  at the  age  of  seventy,  and  many  miracles  were wrought  at  his  tomb.  

NICHOLAS  ALBERGATI  (Bl.)  Bp.  (May  10)  
(16th  cent.)  Born  at  Bologna  in  Italy,  and afterwards  Cardinal  Archbishop  of  that  city, who  by  his  skill  in  negotiations  between  the Holy  See  and  Christian  princes  rendered  great services  to  the  Church,  and  by  his  successful Episcopate  did  much  good  to  souls.  In  his  old age  he  resigned  all  his  dignities  to  perfect  his sanctity  by  becoming  a  Carthusian  monk. He  passed  away  May  10,  A.D;  1443.  

NICHOLAS  (St.)  (June  2)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Greek  by  birth  who  lived  a saintly  life  in  various  solitudes,  mostly  in  the South  of  Italy,  whence  his  surname  "  Peregrinus "  the  pilgrim).  He  worked  many miracles  and  was  canonised  by  Pope  Urban  II in  less  than  five  years  after  his  holy  death (A.D.  1094).  

NICHOLAS  of  TOLENTINO  (St.)  (Sept,  19)  
(14th  cent.)  A  holy  Friar  of  the  Order  of 202 

St.  Augustine  who  closed  a  life  of  humility  and heroic  patience  by  a  saintly  death  at  Tolentino in  Central  Italy  (a.d.  1306),  and  was  canonised in  the  following  century.  

NICHOLAS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  13)  

See  SS.  DANIEL  and  FRANC  rsCAN MARTYRS.  

NICHOLAS  (St.)  Pope.  ( I  >ee.  13)  
(9th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  remarkable  men of  his  age.  He  ably  governed  the  Church  during nine  dark  years  of  the  ninth  century.  Many  of his  letters  are  extant  and  testify  to  his  learning and  holiness.  Missionaries  sent  by  him  effected the  conversion  of  the  Bulgarians.  He  died A.D.  867.  

NICHOLAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  6)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Myra  in  Asia Minor  who  from  the  innocence  of  his  own  life and  the  devotedness  with  which  he,  as  a  Bishop, watched  over  the  young,  has  come  to  be  regarded as  the  Patron  Saint  of  children.  He  died  in the  middle  of  the  fourth  century,  and  some hundred  years  later  his  holy  relics  were  translated to  Bari  in  Italy.  The  familiar  "  Santa Klaus  "  is  a  corrupt  form  of  his  name.  

NICODEMUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  3)  
(1st  cent.)  The  Saint  whom  Our  Lord styled  "  a  Master  in  Israel,"  and  who  shared with  St.  Joseph  of  Arimathsea  the  privilege  of laying  Him  in  the  tomb.  On  August  3,  the Feast  of  the  Finding  of  his  Body  with  that  of St.  Stephen  is  kept.  He  is  also  in  some  places commemorated  on  March  27.  

NICOMEDES  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  15)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Roman  priest  associated  with SS.  Nereus  and  Achilleus  (May  12),  and  St. Petronilla  (May  31),  to  the  last  of  whom  he administered  the  Sacraments  of  the  Dying. St.  Nicomedes  was  scourged  to  death  under Domitian  about  A.D.  90.  

NICOMEDIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (March  18)  
(4th  cent.)  Nicomedia  on  the  Hellespont, the  residence  of  the  Emperor  Diocletian,  had  a large  Christian  population.  It  was  there  he initiated  his  fierce  persecution.  The  number  of Martyrs  at  that  place  is  variously  estimated from  ten  thousand  to  twenty-three  thousand. They  were  for  the  most  part  put  to  death  in the  first  years  of  the  fourth  century,  though  from other  entries  in  the  Martyrology  it  may  be reasonably  inferred  that  the  commemoration of  March  13  refers  specially  to  those  who  under went  capital  punishment  previously  to  a.d.  300. Again,  among  the  Martyrs  are  rightly  reckoned Christians,  victims  in  massacres  carried  out by  the  Pagan  multitude  irrespectively  of  the Imperial  Law.  Such  massacres  were  encouraged or  at  least  tolerated  by  the  authorities.  

NICOMEDIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (June  23)  
(4th  cent.)  Numerous  Christians  of  Nicomedia who,  while  the  persecution  under  Diocletian was  raging,  had  taken  refuge  in  .the forests  and  mountain  ravines  in  the  neighbourhood. They  were  hunted  out  and  in  great numbers  sealed  their  Faith  with  their  blood (A.D.  303).  

NICOMEDIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (Dec.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  The  victims  of  an  atrocious massacre  of  Christians  perpetrated  at  Nicomedia, the  Imperial  residence  on  the  Hellespont (a.d.  301),  by  order  of  the  Emperor  Diocletian. The  Greeks  estimate  that  some  twenty  thousand of  the  Faithful  perished  in  the  indiscriminate slaughter  of  men,  women  and  children.  

NICOMEDIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (Dec.  25)  
(4th cent.) Many hundreds of Christians 
who,  assembled  in  a  church,  perished  through 
the  building  being  surrounded  by  soldiers  and 
set  on  fire  by  order  of  the  Emperor  Diocletian.  

NICON  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  23)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  band  of  one  hundred  Italian Martyrs  whom  modern  investigation  has  proved to  have  suffered  in  Sicily  and  not  in  Palestine, as  registered  by  mistake  in  the  Roman  Martyrology. The  record of St.  Nicon  is  singular. 
NOTHELM 

He  was  a  Roman  soldier  of  some  distinction. Then,  while  travelling  in  the  East,  he  became a  Christian,  and  in  company  with  others embraced  the  monastic  life.  Because  of  the persecution  threatened  in  Palestine,  they  took refuge  in  Sicily,  and  were  there,  every  one, put  to  death  under  Decius  (a.d.  250). NICON  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  28)  

See  SS.  MARCUS,  ALPHIUS,  &c. NICON  (St.)  (Nov.  26)  
(10th  cent.)  An  Armenian  monk  who travelled  (chiefly  in  Greece)  as  a  missionary, preaching  and  converting  many  both  by  his eloquence  and  by  the  holiness  of  his  life.  He died  in  his  own  country,  A.D.  998. NICOSTRATUS,  ANTIOCHUS  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (May  21)  
(4th  cent.)  A  cohort  of  Roman  soldiers  put to  death  at  Caesarea  Philippi  (Palestine)  in  the persecution  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  303).  St. Nicostratus  was  their  Tribune  or  commanding officer.  They  appear  to  have  suffered  at  the same  period  as  St.  Procopius,  Martyr. NICOSTRATUS  (St.)  M.  (July  7)

NILAMMON  (St.)  (June  6)  
(5th  cent.) An  Egyptian  monk  of  holy  life 
whom  the  inhabitants  of  a  neighbouring  city 
insisted on having as their Bishop. The 
Patriarch  was  asked  by  the  reluctant  Nilammon 
to  consent  to  a  delay  while  he  prayed.  Then, 
kneeling  down  and  representing  his  reluctance 
to  Almighty  God,  he  suddenly  passed  from  this 
life,  a.d.  403.

See  SS.  PELEUS,  NILUS,  &c. NILUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  26)  
(10th  cent.)  A  Greek  of  Southern  Italy, and  the  founder  of  the  well-known  Greek monastery  of  Grotta  Ferrata  near  Rome.  In his  youth  he  had  committed  a  sin  he  deemed  so heinous  as  to  call  for  a  lifelong  penance.  First as  a  hermit  and  afterwards  as  the  head  of  a Religious  community,  he  faithfully  carried  this out.  He  died  at  the  age  of  ninety-five,  universally venerated,  about  a.d.  1000. NILUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  12)  
(5th  cent.)  A  learned  Eastern  monk,  surnamed  by  his  contemporaries  "  Sapiens  "  or  the Wise.  He  made  his  home  with  the  Solitaries of  Mount  Sinai  and  emerged  into  public  life mainly  as  a  supporter  of  the  persecuted  St. John  Chrysostom.  Most  of  his  works,  which are  chiefly  ascetic,  are  still  extant.  He  died at  Constantinople  some  time  after  a.d.  430. NIMMIA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  12)  

See  SS.  HILARIA,  DIGNA,  &c.  

NINIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  16)  
(5th  cent.) The  Apostle  of  Cumberland  and 
of  the  Southern  Picts  of  Scotland.  He  was  a 
Briton  by  birth,  but  educated  in  Rome,  and 
thence  sent  on  his  mission  to  the  island  of  his 
birth. Having  founded  the  Episcopal  See  of 
Withern  or  "  Candida  Casa  "  (so-called  because 
St.  Ninian's  Cathedral  was  built  of  white  stone, 
the  first  to  be  so  in  Britain),  St.  Ninian  entered 
into  eternal  rest  a.d.  432. The  See  of  Withern 
is  now  represented  by  that  of  Galloway.  

♦NISSEN  (St.)  Abbot.  (July  25)  
(5th  cent.) A  convert  in  Ireland  made  by 
St.  Patrick,  who  set  him  over  a  monastery  at 
Montgarth  (Mountgarret)  in  the  present  county 
of  Wexford.  

♦NITHARD  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  3)  
(9th cent.)  One of the early Christian 

missionaries  to  Sweden.  He  was  put  to  death by  the  Pagan  inhabitants  of  that  country A.D.  840.  

♦NIVARD  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  1)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Reims  who died  about  a.d.  670,  and  is  there  venerated  as  a Saint.

See  SS.  DONATA,  PAULINA, &c.  

NONNA  (St.)  Widow.  (Aug.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  The  mother  of  St.  Gregory  of Nazianzum,  a  matron  of  exemplary  life,  who obtained  the  conversion  of  her  husband  by  her prayers.  She  was  the  model  of  a  Christian mother,  and  a  helper  to  all  in  poverty  and distress.  The  touching  Panegyric  or  Funeral Discourse  pronounced  over  her  remains  by  her son  St.  Gregory  does  equal  credit  to  the  heads and  hearts  of  both.  St.  Nonna  lived  to  a  great age,  dying  at  Nazianzum  (Asia  Minor)  about A.D.  375.  

♦NONNITA  (NONNA)  (St.)  (March  3)  
(6th  cent.)  The  mother  of  St.  David  and consequently  a  Saint  of  the  first  half  of  the sixth  century.  She  retired  into  a  Convent and  came  into  such  repute  of  sanctity  that churches  were  dedicated  to  her  after  her  death. Some  have  it  that  she,  like  so  many  others  of her  fellow-countrymen  of  that  age,  ended  her days  in  Brittany.  There  is  a  Cornish  St. Nonna  or  Nonnita,  venerated  as  a  VirginMartyr,  confused  sometimes  with  the  mother  of St.  David,  but  materials  for  unravelling  the historical  puzzle  are  altogether  lacking.  

NONNOSUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  2)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Abbot  of  a  monastery  near Rome  to  whose  virtues  and  miracles  St.  Gregory the  Great  bears  witness.  By  his  Faith  he literally  moved  mountains.  He  appears  to have  lived  somewhat  earlier  in  the  sixth  century than  the  great  Pope  who  has  written  concerning him.  

NONNUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  2)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Syrian  Bishop  of  Edessa,  best known  for  having  by  his  eloquent  preaching converted  the  famous  St.  Pelagia,  the  sinner  of Antioch.  That  he  was  a  man  of  God  is  evident from  all  that  we  read  in  the  records  left  of  his holy  penitent.  St.  Pelagia  died  a.d.  457,  and St.  Nonnus  probably  about  the  same  year.  

NORBERT  (St.)  Bp.  (June  6)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  in  Lorraine  (a.d.  1080; of  a  noble  family,  St.  Norbert  for  some  years led  a  worldly  life  at  the  Court  of  the  Emperor Henry  IV.  Miraculously  converted  to  God,  he founded  the  Order  of  Canons  Regular,  known from  the  name  of  their  first  monastery  as Premonstratensians,  and  later  became  Archbishop of  Magdeburg  in  Saxony.  He  revived popular  devotion  to  the  Blessed  Sacrament  of the  Altar  and  strenuously  resisted  the  heresies which  in  his  age  impugned  the  Catholic  Doctrine of  the  Real  Presence.  He  died  A.D.  1134, famous  throughout  Europe  for  his  zeal  and holiness  of  life.  

NOSTRIANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  14)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Naples  remarkable for  his  zeal  and  skill  in  defending  Catholic doctrine  against  the  subtle  issues  raised  by  the Arian  heretics  of  his  age.  He  probably  died about  A.D.  450.  

♦NOTHBURGA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  14)  
(14th  cent.)  A  Tyrolese  Saint,  a  poor  servant girl,  whose  only  delight  upon  earth  was  the helping,  as  she  could,  those  even  poorer  than herself.  Her  shrine  at  Eben  in  the  mountains is  a  much  frequented  place  of  pilgrimage.  

♦NOTHELM  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  17)  
(8th  cent.)  A  saintly  Archbishop  of  Canterbury, friend  and  helper  in  his  historical  labours of  Venerable  Bede,  and  much  esteemed  by St.  Boniface,  Apostle  of  Germany.  St.  Nothelm died  A.D.  740.

NOTKER 
♦NOTKER  BABULUS  (Bl.)  (April  6)  
(10th  cent.)  A  famous  monk  of  the  Abbey of  St.  Gall  in  Switzerland.  Though  his  utterance was  such  as  to  have  earned  him  the  name  of Babulus  (Stammerer),  he  was  the  greatest musician  of  his  age,  and  successfully  reformed the  Church  chant.  He  introduced  what  are called  Sequences  into  the  Liturgy,  and  he  himself composed  both  the  words  and  the  music of  many  of  them.  Though  in  high  favour  with the  great  men  of  bis  time,  he  ever  lived  a  zealous and  humble  monk.  He  died  at  St.  Gall  A.D. 912 
NOVATUS  (St.)  (June  20)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  son  of  Pudens  the  Senator, he  was  the  brother  of  SS.  Praxedes  and  Pudentiana,  and  like  them  venerated  from  the  earliest ages  as  a  Saint.  He  is  believed  to  have  died about  a.d.  151.  

♦NOYALA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  6)

NUMERIANUS  (MEMORIANUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (July  5) (7th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Treves  in  Germany, where  he  succeeded  St.  Modwaldus.  The records  of  his  Pastoral  work  have  been  lost. He  died,  according  to  some,  a.d.  658,  according to  others,  eight  years  later.  

NUMIDICUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  9) (3rd  cent.)  The  number  of  Martyrs  included by  the  Roman  Martyrology  as  fellow-sufferers with  St.  Numidicus  is  unknown.  They  were Africans,  and  perished  at  the  stake,  probably a.d.  252,  as  victims  of  the  Decian  persecution, though  the  Roman  Martyrology  attributes their  Passion  to  the  edicts  of  Valerian.  Numidicus, it  is  stated,  was  dragged  still  breathing, out  of  the  ashes  of  the  funeral  pyre,  and  lived for  some  years  afterwards  as  one  of  the  clergy of  the  Church  of  Carthage.

(Date  uncertain.)  The  Feast  of  this  Saint is  kept  on  Sept.  5  at  Toledo  in  Spain,  and  is  so registered  in  the  Roman  Martyrology,  but  it has  been  found  impossible  to  identify  her.  The most  probably  conjecture  is  that  St.  Obdulia  is really  St.  Odilia,  one  of  the  Christians  put  to death  with  St.  Ursula,  and  that  her  relics  were in  early  times  translated  into  Spain.

In  this  they were  successful ;  but  the  Pagans  rose  against their  noble  monarch,  drove  him  into  exile,  and in  the  end  killed  him  in  battle  near  Drontheim (a.d.  1030)  in  the  sixteenth  year  of  his  reign. He  was  forthwith  and  rightly  venerated  as  a Martyr  to  the  Christian  Faith. *OLAVE  of  SWEDEN  (St.)  King,  M.  (July  30)

to  the  saving  of  souls.  Consecrated  (a.d.  1669)  

Archbishop  of  Armagh,  he  laboured  successfully 
in  restoring  the  discipline  of  the  Irish  Church, 
laid  waste  by  the  continuous  persecuting  of 
Catholicism  in  that  age.  He  was  arrested  on 
a  charge  of  complicity in  one of  the  sham 
plots  of  the  time, and brought  for  trial  to 
London.  The notorious Jeffries, not yet a 
Judge, was the prosecuting counsel.  Chief 
Justice  Pemberton,  "whose  conducting  of  the 
trial (writes Lord Campbell) was a  disgrace 
to  himself  and  his  country," in  condemning

of  the  highest  nature.  A  greater  crime  cannot 
be  committed  against  God  than  for  a  man  to 
endeavour  to  propagate  your  religion." Blessed 
Oliver  was  hanged, drawn and  quartered  at 
Tyburn  (a.d. 1681).  The  words  : "  I  desire 
to  be  dissolved  and  to  be  with  Christ  "  are  his 
last recorded utterance.  His body is now 
enshrined  at  Downside  Abbey,  near  Bath.  He

She  was  appointed  a  deaconess of  the  Church  at  Constantinople,  and,  devotedly attached  as  she  was  to  the  cause  of  the  exiled St.  John  Chrysostom,  was  herself  persecuted  on his  account.  Several  Greek  Fathers  of  her time  speak  in  her  praise.  She  passed  away, as  would  seem,  soon  after  a.d.  400. OLYMPIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  12)  
(4th  cent.) An  Eastern  Bishop  persecuted and  driven  into  exile  by  the  Arians  some  time in  the  fourth  century.  His  Acts  have  been  lost. OLYMPIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  26)

ONESIPHORUS  and  PORPHYRIUS  (Sept.  6)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(1st  cent.)  What  Holy  Scripture  tells  us  of Onesiphorus  is  to  be  read  in  St.  Paul's  Second Epistle  to  Timothy  (ii.  16-18).  St.  Porphyrius was  a  member  of  his  household.  They  laboured in  the  work  of  spreading  the  Gospel  until  towards the  end  of  the  first  century.  Then,  tradition alleges  that  they  were  seized  by  agents  of  the persecuting  Emperor  Domitian  somewhere  on the  Hellespont,  tied  to  wild  horses  and  so  torn to  pieces.

He  relates  too  how  he assisted  at  the  Saint's  holy  death  and  reverently interred  his  remains.  This  event  must have  happened  late  in  the  fourth  or  early  in the  fifth  century.

reckons  him,  with  St.  Cyprian,  Lactantius  and 
others, as most excellent among Christian 
writers.  His works, still extant, are often 
referred  to  by  Theologians, a.d.  372  is  given 
as  the  probable  date  of  his  death.  

OPTATUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  31)

1016, held  in  veneration  as  a Saint  by  the 
inhabitants  of  the  district,  who  in  the  fifteenth 
century were authorised to keep her Feast 
liturgically.  But  she  may  be  a  Saint  of  much 
earlier date.  No particulars about her are 
extant.  

OSEE  (HOSEA)  (St.)  Prophet.  (July  4)  
(8th  cent.  B.C.)  Osee  seems,  among  the  Ten

This  event  is said  to  have  taken  place  about  the  middle  of  the seventh  century,  but  both  the  date  and  the particulars  are  open  to  controversy.  It  is  also possible  that  two  or  more  saintly  personages  of the  same  name  have  been  confused  into  the  one St.  Osith,  V.M. *OSMANNA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  9)

He  perished in  the  Battle  of  Maserfleld  (A.D.  642)  against Penda  and  his  Pagans  of  Mercia.

who,  embracing  the  life  of  the  cloister,  gathered

have  passed  her days  in  continuous  prayer.  

She  died  in  her  monastery  of  Hohenburg,  about 
A.D.  720.  

OTHMAR  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  16)

Born  of  noble  parents  in  South Germany,  he  by  his  talents  obtained  great influence  at  the  Court  of  the  hapless  Henry  IV. and  did  much  to  stifle  the  schism  which  that Prince,  by  the  appointment  of  Anti-Popes, sought  to  set  up.  Besides  his  successful Pastorate  at  Bamberg,  he,  invited  by  the  King of  Poland,  who  had  conquered  Pomerania,  made two  missionary  journeys  to  that  province,  and practically  converted  its  population  to  Christianity. St.  Otho  died  at  Bamberg,  June  30,  a.d. 1139.  

♦OTTERAN  (St.)  (Oct.  27)  
(6th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Columba  at Iona,  where  he  himself  ended  his  labours  for Christ.  So  great  was  the  veneration  in  which he  was  held  that  in  a  later  age,  when  the Bishopric  of  Waterford  was  established,  St. Otteran  was  chosen  by  the  people  as  its  Patron Saint.  

♦OUDACEUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  2)  
(6th  cent.)  Son  of  Budic,  Prince  of  Brittany, but  brought  up  in  Wales  by  St.  Teilo,  whose successor  as  Bishop  of  Llandaff  he  became. He  was  remarkable  as  a  pastor  of  souls  for  his zeal  and  charity.  A.D.  564  is  given  as  the  date of  his  death.

PACHOMIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (May  14)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  celebrated  of  the "  Fathers  of  the  Desert."  He  was  a  hermit  in the  Thebaid  (Upper  Egypt)  from  soon  after  his conversion  to  Christianity,  and  there  became a  disciple  of  the  Abbot  Palaemon.  St.  Pachomius  founded  several  monasteries  governed  by a  very  austere  Rule,  which  he  himself  had compiled.  He  seems  to  have  been  the  first to  group  Religious  Houses  subject  to  one  Rule under  the  jurisdiction  of  a  Father  General  or Head  Abbot.  At  the  time  of  his  holy  death (a.d.  348)  seven  thousand  monks  were  in  this manner  governed  by  him.

PACIFICUS  (St.)  (Sept.  25)  
(18th  cent.) A Franciscan Friar  in Italy, 

known  from  his  native  village  as  of  San  Severino. In  prey  all  his  life  long  to  intense  bodily  pains, he  sought  for  comfort  and  relief  in  God  alone, and  was  by  Him  favoured  with  marvellous supernatural  graces  and  with  the  gift  of  working miracles.

They  both  fell  victims  to  the  fury of  the  persecution  under  Diocletian,  and  were executed  (a.d.  302)  at  Fermo,  a  town  not  far distant  from  Ancona.  It  is  at  Fermo  that  their relics  are  enshrined.

The Palestinian  Martyrs  of  the  persecutions  under the  Roman  Emperors  from  Nero  to  Diocletian and  Licinius  are  commemorated  separately  on other  days  or  mentioned  as  fellow-sufferers  with some  Christian  hero.

(7th  cent.)  Fourteen  hundred  and  eighty Christians  massacred  at  Samaria  or  in  its neighbourhood  (a.d.  614)  during  the  war between  the  Greek  Emperor  Heraclius  and  the Pagan  Chosroas  of  Persia.  

PALESTINE  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (Aug.  16)  
(Date  unknown.)  Thirty-three  Martyrs  registered as  such  in  the  ancient  Martyrologies  and by  Greek  tradition.  They  are  said  to  have suffered  in  Palestine,  but  modern  research  has so  far  failed  to  trace  them.  

PALESTINE  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (May  16)  
(7th  cent.)  Forty-four  monks  of  the  monastery of  St.  Sabbas  massacred  by  Pagan  Arabs during  an  inroad  into  Palestine  (A.D.  614). Some  writers,  however,  hold  that  they  were among  the  victims  of  the  Persian  invasion  during the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Heraclius.  The dates  hardly  differ.  

PALESTINE  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (Feb.  19)  
(6th  cent.) A  number  of  monks  and  laymen 
massacred  in  an  inroad  of  heathens,  styled  by

PAMBO 
least  in  great  part  to  have  been  Christian soldiers  in  the  Imperial  army.  Possibly  this massacre  had  some  connection  with  that  nearly simultaneous  of  St.  Maurice  and  the  Theban Legion.  The  date  given  for  the  Martyrdom  of St.  Palmatius  is  a.d.  287.  

♦PAMBO  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  6)  
(4th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Antony  and  one of  the  most  celebrated  of  the  Fathers  of  the Egyptian  Desert.  Among  the  many  who  had recourse  to  him  for  spiritual  counsel  were St.  Melania  and  the  great  St.  Athanasius  himself. A.D.  385  is  probably  the  date  of  the  death of  St.  Pambo.  

PAMMACHIUS  (St.)  (Aug.  30)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Roman  nobleman,  the  husband of  Paulina,  daughter  of  St.  Paula.  He  thus came  into  the  circle  of  St.  Jerome,  who  esteemed him  greatly,  as  we  gather  from  the  correspondence still  extant.  After  the  death  of  his wife,  St.  Pammachius  took  Holy  Orders  and served  the  Church  with  great  zeal.  His Translations  of  Origen's  works  are  of  considerable value.  He  closed  his  holy  and  useful life,  a.d.  410.  

PAMPHILUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  28)  
(8th  cent.) A  holy  Prelate  in  the  South  of

A  victim  at  Nicomedia  in  Asia Minor  of  the  cruelty  of  Diocletian,  of  whom previous'y  he  had  been  a  favourite  and  advanced to  a  high  post  at  the  Imperial  Court.  Seduced by  the  Emperor  from  the  Faith  of  Christ,  he, moved  by  the  prayers  of  his  mother  and  sisters, soon  repented  of  his  apostasy,  and,  heroically confessing  Christ,  was  scourged  and  beheaded (A.D.  302).  

PANCRAS  (St.)  M.  (May  12)  
(4th  cent.)  A  celebrated  Roman  Martyr  in the  great  persecution  under  Diocletian.  He  is said  to  have  been  a  mere  boy  of  fourteen  when he  bravely  gave  his  life  tor  Christ.  A  present sent  by  Pope  St.  Vitalian  in  the  seventh  century of  part  of  his  relics  to  one  of  the  Anglo-Saxon kings  led  to  great  popular  devotion  and  to  the dedication  of  many  churches  to  him  in  England 
PANCRATIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  3)  
(1st  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Peter  the  Apostle,

forced  her  to  take  refuge  in  England.  There 
she  lived  a  holy  life  in  the  nunnery  of  Ettisley 
in  Cambridgeshire.  The  parish  church  at  that 
place  is  dedicated  to  her.  A.D.  904  is  given 
as  the  date  of  her  death.

(Date  unknown.)  Seven Christian  Martyrs 
have  been  venerated  on  April  1,  in  Hungary,

♦PANTALUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  12)  
(6th  cent.)  An  alleged  Bishop  of  Basle  who perished  at  the  hands  of  Pagans.  Portions  of his  relics  are  venerated  in  various  churches, but  the  traditions  regarding  his  life  and  martyrdom are  too  vague  to  be  serviceable.  

PANTAGATHUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  17)  
(6th  cent.)  Bishop  of  Vienne  in  Gaul, celebrated  for  his  learning  and  for  his  beneficial influence  on  the  government  of  King  Clovis and  his  first  successors.  He  appears  to  have died  at  the  age  of  sixty-five,  A.d.  540,  and  to have  received  at  once  the  cultus  given  to  Saints.

PANTALEON  (St.)  M.  (July  27)  
(4th  cent.)  A  physician  by  profession  and reckoned  with  St.  Luke  the  Patron  Saint  of medical  men.  His  Acts,  as  handed  down  to us,  are  of  very  doubtful  authority.  It  is  certain that  he  suffered  martyrdom  at  the  Imperial residence  of  Nicomedia  between  a.d.  303  and a.d.  305.  He  has  always  been  greatly  honoured throughout  Christendom,  more  especially  by  the

(3rd  cent.)  A  saintly  Christian  of  Lycaonia in  Asia  Minor  who  was  tortured  and  put  to death  for  the  Faith  at  the  outbreak  of  the great  persecution  under  Diocletian  at  the  close of  the  third  century.  

PAPHNUTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  19)

(4th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Saint  who  lost  an eye  when  put  to  the  torture  as  a  Christian under  the  Emperor  Galerius.  Later  he  was consecrated  Bishop  and  gained  the  favour  of the  Emperor  Constantine.  He  is  said  to  have taken  part  (a.d.  325)  in  the  Council  of  Nicsea. Throughout  his  life  he  strenuously  opposed the  Arian  heresy.  Neither  the  name  of  his See  nor  the  precise  date  of  his  death  are  known.  

PAPHNUTIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  24) (4th  cent.)  Martyrs  in  Egypt  under  Diocletian. The  Greeks  have  long  and  detailed accounts  of  their  sufferings,  but  they  are  far from  being  trustworthy  and  are  of  late  date.  

PAPHNUTIUS  (St.)  (Sept.  25)  
(5th  cent.)  The  father  of  St. Euphrosyne 
and  afterwards  a  hermit  in  Egypt.  He  died

PAPIAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  22)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  celebrated  Bishop  of  Hierapolis  in  Phrygia  (Asia  Minor),  perhaps  a  disciple of  St.  John  the  Evangelist,  but  certainly  a friend  of  St.  Polycarp  of  Smyrna.  He  lived  to a  great  age  and  wrote  much,  but  of  his  writings only  fragments  are  extant.  On  the  authority of  Eusebius  he  was  at  one  time  believed  to  have been  an  upholder  of  the  Millenarian  error (that  of  the  thousand  years  Earthly  Kingdom of  Christ),  but  modern  research  has  freed  him from  that  charge.

He  died, aged  eighty-seven,  a.d.  1267  and  many miracles  attested  his  sanctity. PARMENAS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  23)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  seven  deacons  ordained by  the  Apostles (Acts  vi.  5). Tradition  says that  after  a  long  life  spent  in  preaching  the Gospel  in  Asia  Minor  he  was  put  to  death  as  a Christian  at  Philippi  in  Macedonia,  under  the Emperor  Trajan,  about  A.d.  98.

He  was  distinguished  in  the  Dark  Age  in  which he  lived  for  holiness  of  life  and  great  learning. Zealous  and  eloquent,  he  did  much  to  combat simony  and  to  reform  Church  discipline,  while bravely  resisting  the  Oriental  heresy  of  the Image-breakers.  His  recovery  and  enshrining of  the  bodies  of  St.  Cecilia  and  other  Martyrs has  earned  him  the  gratitude  of  posterity. He  passed  away  a.d.  824. PASCHAL  BAYLON  (St.)  (May  17)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Saint,  born  of  poor parents,  who  became  a  lay-brother  among  the Reformed  Franciscans.  His  life  of  humility, penance  and  prayer  was  such  as  to  attract  the veneration  of  all  who  knew  him  even  during his  lifetime,  and  after  his  holy  death  (A.D. 1592)  many  miracles  attested  his  sanctity. His  singular  devotion  to  the  Most  Holy  Sacra

ment of  the  Altar  has  singled  him  out  as  the Saint  of  the  Eucharist.  He  was  canonised  A.D. 1690. PASCHASIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  22)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Vienne  in France,  distinguished  for  his  holiness  of  life, who  appears  to  have  flourished  towards  the close  of  the  great  persecution  under  Diocletian  ; but  like  others  in  Gaul  and  Britain,  to  have been  spared,  thanks  to  the  lenity  of  the  Csesar, Constantius  Chlorus.  No  particulars  concerning him  have  come  down  to  us. PASCHASIUS  (St.)  (May  31)  
(6th  cent.) A  saintly  Roman  deacon,  mentioned by  St.  Gregory  the  Great,  and  the  author of  some theological Tracts. He died about A.D.  512. *PASCHASIUS  RADBERT  (St.)  (April  26)  
(9th  cent.)  A  learned  French  monk,  Abbot of  the  great  monastery  of  New  Corbie  in  Saxony . He  was  conspicuous  for  his  zeal  and  piety  ; but  he  is  best  known  by  the  works  he  has  left establishing  the  Catholic  Doctrine  of  the  Holy Eucharist.  We  have  also  a  Commentary  on the  Gospels  and  other  useful  Treatises  from  his pen.  He  died  about  a.d.  865,  his  last  wish being  that  no  one  should  write  his  life.  This humble  desire  was  unfortunately  attended  to by  his  contemporaries. PASCHASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  13)

(Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  in  one  of  the early  persecutions  in  Mysia  (Asia  Minor). St.  Pasicrates  was  only  twenty-two  years  of age.  Two  others,  besides  St.  Valentio,  suffered with  him. PASTOR,  VICTORINUS  and  OTHERS (March  29)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  uncertain.)  Eastern  Martyrs,  seven in  number,  who  gave  their  lives  for  Christ  at Nicomedia  in  Asia  Minor,  probably  under Diocletian,  at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth century.  But  all  particulars  are  lacking. PASTOR  (St.)  Bp.  (March  30)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Tradition  assigns  him  to the  sixth  century  and  describes  him  as  Bishop of  Orleans  in  Gaul,  but  the  catalogue  of  Bishops of  that  city  do  not  contain  his  name.  The  old Martyrologies,  however,  commemorate  him  as such  on  the  above  date. PASTOR  (St.)  (July  26)  
(2nd  cent.) A  saintly  Roman  priest,  associated in  his work with SS. Pudentiana and Praxedes.  He  has left  his  name  to  the  Title or  Parish  of  St.  Pudentiana  in  Rome. PASTOR  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  6)  

See  SS.  JUSTUS  and  PASTOR. PATAPIUS  (St.)  (Dec.  8)  
(Date  uncertain.) An  Egyptian  Saint  who 
passed  his  life  as  a  hermit  in  the  suburbs  of 
Constantinople  and  is  much  venerated  in  the 
East.  

PATERIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  21)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Roman  monk,  disciple  of  St. Gregory  the  Great,  who  was  made  Bishop  of Brescia  in  Lombardy  and  has  left  us  Commentaries on  both  the  Old  and  the  New  Testaments. He  passed  away  (A.D.  606)  in  great fame  of  sanctity. PATERMUTHIAS, COPRES and  ALEXANDER 
(SS.)  MM.  (July  9)  
(4th  cent.)  Egyptians  burned  to  death  as Christians  under  Julian  the  Apostate  (A.d.  363). St.  Copres  had  yielded  an  instant  to  the  seductions of  the  idolaters,  but  was  reconverted  on witnessing  the  courage  of  St.  Patermuthias and  fastened  to  the  stake  with  him.  The  relics of  these  Martyrs  are  venerated  in  Rome, whither  they  were  translated  from  Alexandria. PATERNIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (July  12)  
(5th  cent.)  Nothing  is  now  known  with  any certainty  about  this  holy  name,  except  that  he was  a  fifth  century  Bishop  of  Bologna  in  Italy, 
209 

PATERNUS 
and  of  such  merit  and  fame  for  holiness  of  life that  his  flock  from  the  time  of  his  death  has always  venerated  him  as  a  Saint.  His  Church of  Bologna  has  up  to  the  present  day  celebrated July  12  as  the  anniversary  of  his  departure from  this  life  as  a  Festival.  It  seems  clear that  he  is  other  than  the  St.  Paternian  venerated at  Fermo  and  elsewhere  on  Nov.  13.  

PATERNUS  (PADARN)  (St.)  Bp.  (April  16)  
(6th  cent.)  There  is  great  difficulty  in  unravelling the  history  of  this  Saint,  celebrated in  Wales  as  the  Founder  of  Llan-patero-vaur. He  appears  to  have  been  a  Breton  by  birth, and  after  studying  in  Ireland,  to  have  settled as  a  hermit  in  Wales.  Thence  he  passed  over into  Normandy,  where  in  his  old  age  he  was made  Bishop  of  Avranches.  Famous  for  his care  of  the  poor  as  much  as  for  the  austerity of  his  life,  he  passed  away  about  A.d.  550.  

PATERNUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  21)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Christian  who, coming  as  a  pilgrim  to  Rome  during  the  reign of  either  Decius  or  Valerian,  that  is,  in  some year  between  a.d.  250  and  a.d.  260,  was arrested  in  a  neighbouring  town  on  account of  his  religion,  and  expired  in  the  dungeon  into which  he  was  thrown.  

PATERNUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.  23)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Roman  Martyrology  assigns Coutances  in  Normandy  as  the  place  of  the death  of  this  St.  Paternus,  but  it  would  seem erroneously.  It  is  also  likely  that  he  should not  be  described  as  a  Martyr.  The  Bollandists identify  him  with  St.  Paternus  of  Avranches  of April  16  {which  see).  The  mistake,  if  there  be one  in  the  Roman  record,  originated  with  the old  writer,  Usuardus.  

PATERNUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  12)  
(Date  unknown.) He  appears  to  have 
suffered  at  Sens  in  France,  and  to  have  been  a 
monk,  but  nothing authentic  concerning  him 
has  come  down  to  our  times.  

PATIENS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  8)  
(2nd  cent.)  Venerated  as  the  fourth  Bishop and  as  the  Patron  Saint  of  Metz.  He  is  celebrated on  account  of  the  miracles  wrought  at his  intercession,  but  nothing  reliable  concerning the  particulars  of  his  life  has  come down  to  us.  

PATIENS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  10)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Lyons  of whom  St.  Sidonius  Apollinaris,  his  contemporary and  admirer,  testifies  that,  despite  the austerity  of  his  life,  he  made  himself  "  all  things to  all  men."  He  played  his  part  zealously  in repressing  the  heresies  of  his  time ;  but  his memory  remains  in  especial  benediction  among the  poor  and  distressed,  not  only  of  his  own Diocese,  but  of  other  parts  of  Gaul.  To  their relief  he  devoted  all  his  revenues.  

PATIENTIA  (St.)  M.  (May  1)  

See  SS.  ORENTIUS  and  PATIENTIA.  

♦PATRICIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  10)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Scottish  Bishop  driven  from his  See  by  heathen  invaders.  He  finished  his life  in  the  Isle  of  Man.  

PATRICK  (St.)  Bp.  (March  17)  
(5th  cent.)  Lives  of  the  great  Apostle  of Ireland  are  in  the  hands  of  all,  and  his  writings have  again  and  again  been  published  and translated.  There  is  a  controversy  as  to  the date  (4th  cent.)  and  place  of  his  birth.  In  his sixteenth  year  he  was  carried  into  captivity, together  with  other  clients  and  slaves  of  his father,  Calphurnius,  and  taken  to  Ireland. Here  he  was  admonished  in  vision  of  his future  work.  Escaping  from  his  captors,  he travelled  through  Britain,  Gaul  and  Italy, and  in  Rome  received  his  mission  from  Pope St.  Celestine  (a.d.  423-432).  Coming  to Ireland,  he  devoted  himself  entirely  to  the work  thus  set  him.  He  converted  numberless heathens  to  Christianity,  and,  by  establishing various  Bishoprics  and  holding  several  Councils, organised  the  Church  of  the  country.  He  died 210 

and  was  buried  at  Down  in  Ulster,  but  his titular  See  he  had  long  before  fixed  at  Armagh. The  precise  year  of  his  entering  into  everlasting rest  is  somewhat  uncertain.  Butler  gives a.d.  464  as  most  probable.  

♦PATRICK  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  24)  
(5th  cent.)  This  St.  Patrick  would  be  the controverted  Sen-Patrick  (Patrick  the  Elder) whom  several  traditions  mention  as  a  kinsman and  contemporary  of  the  Apostle  of  Ireland. Some  have  it  that  Sen-Patrick  died  at  Ruisdela  (Kilkenny),  others  at  Glastonbury  in England.  The  whole  matter  is  altogether obscure.  There  is  also  a  St.  Patrick,  Abbot  of Nevers  in  France,  likewise  commemorated  on August  24.  It  is  likely,  however,  that  the coincidence  in  names  of  several  distinct  personages is  responsible  in  part  for  the  confusion. St.  Gildard,  a  priest,  is  in  certain  documents registered  in  connection  with  one  or  other  of the  above.  

PATRITIA  (St.)  M.  (March  13)  

See  SS.  MACEDONIUS,  PATRITIA, &c.  

PATRITIA  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  25)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Christian  maiden  of Constantinople,  who,  while  on  a  pilgrimage  to the  Holy  Places  of  Rome  and  Jerusalem, passed  away  at  Naples,  where  a  church  was built  in  her  honour.  The  particulars  traditional about  her  are  unreliable  and  in  some  instances contradictory.  

PATRITIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  16)  
(Date  unknown.)  Registered  as  Bishop  of the  people  of  Auvergne.  But  no  similar  name is  to  be  found  in  the  Catalogues  of  the  Sees of  Auvergne.  Modern  opinion  tends  to  identify him  with  St.  Patrick  of  Ireland  and  to  attribute the  mistake  of  the  Martyrologies  to  some copyists  writing  "  Arvernis  "  for  "  Hibernis." 
PATRITIUS,  ACATIUS,  MENANDER  and  POLY
^ENUS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  28)  
(Date uncertain.) A group  of  Martyrs of 
Prusa  (Broussa)  in  Bithynia  in  Asia  Minor.  

They  probably  suffered  in  the  second  century, 
but  no  reliable  account  of  them  exists.  

PATROBAS  (St.)  (Nov.  4)  

See  SS.  PHILOLOGUS  and  PATROBAS.  

PATROCLUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  21)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Troyes  in  Gaul nobly  born  and  very  rich,  who,  living  himself an  austere  life  of  penance,  had  given  all  his goods  to  the  poor.  Summoned  to  answer  the charge  of  being  a  Christian  before  (it  is  said) the  Emperor  Aurelian  in  person,  he  bravely underwent  torture  and  death  rather  than deny  his  Master.  He  suffered  about  a.d.  274.  

♦PATTO  (St.)  Bp.  (March  30)  
(8th  cent.)  Inflamed  with  zeal  for  the salvation  of  souls,  St.  Patto  left  Ireland  some time  in  the  eighth  century.  He  became  Abbot of  a  monastery  at  Amarbaric  (Saxony),  and  later Bishop  of  Werden.  His  remains  were  exhumed (a.d.  1630),  and  many  miracles  bore  witness to  his  sanctity.  

PAUL,  THE  FIRST  HERMIT  (St.)  (Jan.  10)  
(4th  cent.)  The  Life  of  this  Saint,  written by  St.  Jerome,  tells  us  that  he  was  an  Egyptian of  good  birth  and  well  educated.  Still  a  youth, he  fled  into  the  desert  country  about  Thebes  to escape  the  persecution  then  raging.  Delighted and  helped  by  solitude  he  persevered  in  the Eremitical  life  even  after  the  Peace  of  the Church,  and  is  said  to  have  passed  ninety  years in  the  Desert,  where  he  died  A.D.  342,  comforted at  the  end  by  a  visit  from  St.  Antony, the  Father  of  Monks.

(5th  cent.) A  holy  Bishop  of  the  place  now 
called Trois-Chateaux  in Dauphine (France), 
PAUL 

where  he  died  about  A.D.  410.  He  took  part in  the  Council  of  Valence  (A.D.  374),  and  is venerated  as  the  worker  of  many  miracles. *PAUL  JOHN  and  JAMES  (Bl.)  MM.  (Feb.  5)  
(16th  cent.)  Three  native  Christians  in Japan  who  had  entered  the  Society  of  Jesus and  were  among  the»  first  to  shed  their  blood for  Christ  in  that  country.  They  were  crucified at  Nangasaki,  Feb.  5,  A.D.  1597. PAUL,  LUCIUS  and  CYRIACUS(SS.)MM.  (Feb.  8)  
(Date unknown.) Roman Martyrs whose 
relics  have  been  venerated  in  Rome  from  early 
times,  but  the  Acts  of  whose  martyrdom  have 
long  since  perished.  

PAUL  OF  VERDUN  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  8)  
(7th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  said  to  have been  the  brother  of  St.  Germanus  of  Paris. From  being  a  monk  he  was  raised  to  the  See of  Verdun,  where  by  his  zeal  and  charity  he did  much  for  the  good  of  his  flock.  A.D.  647 is  given  as  the  date  of  his  holy  death. PAUL, HERACLIUS, SECUNDILLA and 
JANUARIA  (SS.)  MM.  (March  2)  
(Date  unknown.)  Described  in  the  Roman Martyrology  as  having  suffered  at  Porto  at  the Mouth  of  the  Tiber.  Nothing  further  is  known about  them.  
♦PAUL  NAVARRUS  and  OTHERS  (Bl.)  

MM.  (March  5)  
(17th  cent.)  Japanese  Martyrs  of  the Society  of  Jesus.  Bl.  Paul,  a  Portuguese, was  burned  to  death  in  November,  A.D.  1622, he  being  then  over  sixty  years  of  age.  With him  suffered  three  native  Christians. PAUL  (St.)  Bp.  (March  7)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Prusa  in  Bithynia (Asia  Minor),  a  courageous  opponent  of  the Iconoclasts.  He  died  a.d.  840  in  Egypt, whither  he  had  been  banished  many  years previously. PAUL  THE  SIMPLE  (St.)  (March  7)  
(4th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  eminent  of  the disciples  of  St.  Antony  in  Egypt,  and  a  Solitary especially  distinguished  for  his  supernatural gifts.  Palladius  and  the  historian  Sozomen enlarge  on  his  wonderful  meekness  and  patience. He  passed  away  A.D.  339. PAUL  DE  LEON  (St.)  Bp.  (March  12)  
(6th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  illustrious  of the  galaxy  of  Saints  (David,  Samson,  Gildas, &c.)  educated  in  the  School  and  Monastery  of St.  Illtyd  at  Llantwith-Major.  After  years  of training  in  the  monastic  life  St.  Paul,  responding to  a  Divine  call,  crossed  over  into  Brittany  with twelve  companions.  He  there  founded  Religious communities  and  was  himself  consecrated Bishop  of  a  See  fixed  at  Ocismor  or  Leon (Lyonesse),  now  called  after  him,  St.  Pol,  in the  present  Diocese  of  Quimper.  He  was favoured  by  God  with  many  supernatural  gifts and  was  indefatigable  in  the  discharge  of  his Pastoral  duties.  Previous  to  his  holy  death (a.d.  570),  he  had  retired  anew  to  his  monastery in  an  island  off  the  Breton  coast. PAUL  (St.)  M.  (March  10)  

See  SS.  QUADRATUS  DIONYSIUS,  &c. PAUL  (St.)  M.  (March  17)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Catholic,  burned  at  the  stake by  the  Iconoclasts  (a.d.  762),  either  at  Constantinople, or,  as  recent  research  has  shown, more  probably  in  the  Island  of  Cyprus.  St. John  Damascene  (or  the  Author  of  the  Life  of St.  Stephen,  the  Younger)  makes  mention  of this  St.  Paul  as  one  whose  example  and  courage gave  heart  to  the  Constantinopolitan  Martyrs of  the  period. PAUL,  CYRIL,  EUGENE  and  OTHERS  (March  20)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  A  group  of  seven  Christians registered  in  the  Martyrologies  as  having suffered  in  Syria  in  one  of  the  early  persecutions, but  the  Acts  of  whose  martyrdom  have  long since  T)6rishecl. PAUL  of  NARBONNE  (St.)  Bp.  (March  22)  
(1st cent.) Tradition identifies this Saint 

with  the  Pro-Consul  Sergius  Paulus  of  Cyprus, a  prudent  man  who  desired  to  hear  the  word of  God  (Acts  xiii.  7).  It  is  said  that  later St.  Paul  the  Apostle  converted  him  and  sent him  as  a  missionary  into  the  South  of  Gaul, where  he  became  first  Bishop  of  Narbonno. Many  miracles  are  attributed  to  his  intercession, but  authentic  particulars  of  his  life are  lacking.

PAUL  OF  THE  CROSS  (St.)  (April  28)  
(18th  cent.)  The  Founder  of  the  Passionist Order  and  one  of  the  most  illustrious  Saints  of his  Age.  He  was  a  Piedmontese  of  noble  birth, and  from  his  youth  upwards  remarkable  for  his spirit  of  austere  piety.  Having  received  the Religious  habit  from  the  hands  of  his  Bishop, he  journeyed  to  Rome,  where  he  was  ordained priest  and  favourably  received  by  Pope  Benedict XIII.  He  soon  gathered  numerous disciples  and,  aided  by  them,  converted  countless souls  to  God.  Wonderful  supernatural graces  bore  witness  to  his  sanctity.  He  died at  an  advanced  age,  Nov.  18,  a.d.  1775.

(4th  cent.)  A  celebrated  Archbishop  of Constantinople,  strenuous  upholder  of  the Catholic  Faith  against  the  Arians,  and  in  the end  victim  to  the  bigotry  of  the  Emperor Constant ius.  St.  Paul  was  ever  true  to  the infallible  guidance  of  the  Roman  Church  and was  held  in  high  esteem  by  Pope  St.  Julius and  by  the  great  St.  Athanasius.  Banished to  a  forsaken  little  town  in  Cappadocia,  he  was there  left  without  food  for  six  days  and  then strangled  (a.d.  350).

See  SS.  JOHN  and  PAUL.  

PAUL  I  (St.)  Pope.  (June  28)  
(8th  cent.)  The  brother  and  successor  of Pope  Stephen  II.  He  ruled  the  Church  with wisdom  and  zeal  for  ten  years  ;  and  he  strenuously defended  the  Catholic  doctrine  of  the veneration  due  to  pictures  and  statues  of Christ  and  the  Saints  against  the  Greek  Emperor Constantine  Copronymus.  In  Rome  he  restored and  beautified  the  churches  and  enshrined  the relics  of  many  Saints.  He  passed  away,  amid the  tears  of  his  flock,  June  22,  a.d.  767.  

PAUL  THE  APOSTLE  (St.)  (June 30)  
(1st  cent.)  The  New  Testament  puts  St. Paul  vividly  before  us.  We  have  his  part  in the  Stoning  of  St.  Stephen ;  his  miraculous conversion  ;  his  Apostleship  of  the  Gentiles  ; his  travels  ;  the  hardships  and  persecutions  he underwent ;  and  his  arrival  in  Rome.  The narrative  is  from  the  inspired  pen  of  St.  Luke, the  Apostle's  companion  and  friend,  and  is told  in  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles.  In  Rome, St.  Paul  worked  for  Christ  and  spread  the Christian  Faith  till  a.d.  67,  when,  on  the  same day  as  St.  Peter,  he  gained  the  crown  of  martyrdom. He  was  beheaded  outside  the  walls  of Rome  on  the  Ostian  Way.  His  tomb  has  ever since  been  the  resort  of  pilgrims,  and  a  magnificent Basilica  covers  his  shrine.  What  St.  Paul was  as  a  Saint  is  best  gathered  from  his  fourteen

(9th  cent.)  A  Spanish  deacon  of  Cordova, zealous  in  ministering  to  his  fellow-Christians, persecuted,  imprisoned  and  done  to  death  by the  Mohammedan  Moors,  then  masters  of Spain.  At  last  he  himself  was  called  upon  to give  his  life  for  Christ  (a.d.  851).  Some  days after  his  execution  the  Christians  succeeded in  rescuing  his  remains  and  in  giving  them honourable  burial. PAUL  (St.)  M.  (July  25)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  in  Palestine  under  the Emperor  Galerius(one  of  Diocletian's  colleagues). Before  laying  his  head  on  the  block  (a.d.  308) he  obtained  a  few  minutes  respite  for  prayer, and  interceded,  first  for  his  fellow-courtrymen, then  for  the  spread  of  the  Christian  religion among  both  Jews  and  Gentiles,  next  for  the crowds  gathered  to  see  him  die,  and  lastly  for his  judges  and  executioners.  This  is  the account  given  by  the  historian  Eusebius, contemporary  of  the  Holy  Martyr. PAUL  and  JULIANA  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  17)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  in  Palestine,  either  a.d.

See  SS.  LUCIAN,  METROBIUS,  &c. PAULA  (St.)  Widow.  (Jan.  26)  
(5th  cent.)  Of  this  Saint  we  have  the  Life written  by  St.  Jerome,  her  contemporary  and spiritual  adviser.  She  was  a  Roman  lady  of noble  birth,  married  to  a  certain  Toxotius who  like  her  was  of  Patrician  descent.  They had  five  children,  one  of  whom,  St.  Eustochia, St.  Jerome  styles  "  the  precious  jewel  of  the Church."  In  her  widowhood,  St.  Paula  embraced the  Religious  life,  and  for  twenty  years presided  over  the  Sisterhood  founded  by St.  Jerome  at  Bethlehem  in  the  Holy  Land. To  all  and  throughout  her  whole  life  she  gave abundant  evidence  of  her  eminent  sanctity. St.  Jerome  bears  witness  to  this  in  the  words of  the  Epitaph  he  composed  for  her  tomb at  her  death,  A.D.  404. PAULA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  of  Byzantium who  had  devoted  herself  to  the  service of  her  co-religionists  committed  to  prison  for their  Faith  in  Christ.  At  length,  after  ministering to  St.  Lucillian,  condemned  to  die  at the  stake,  she  was  herself  arrested,  put  to  the torture,  and  in  the  end  beheaded  (a.d.  273).

He  was  a  favourite  of  the Emperor  Charlemagne  and  an  intimate  friend of  the  learned  Alcuin.  He  was  distinguished for  his  energy  in  repressing  the  Adoptianist heresy  and  for  his  missionary  work  in  the Tyrol  and  adjacent  provinces.  He  died A.D.  804.

PAULINUS  (St.)  M.  (May  26)  

See  SS.  FELICISSIMUS,  HERACLIUS, &c.  

PAULINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  22)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  at  Bordeaux  in  France, Paulinus  grew  up  to  become  one  of  the  most cultured  men  of  his  time.  He  was  the  friend of  St.  Ambrose,  St.  Martin  and  other  eminent contemporaries.  He  had  for  his  master  the poet  Ausonius.  Bent  on  entering  the  Ecclesiastical state,  he  retired  to  live  the  life  of  a Solitary  at  Nola  near  Naples,  but  was  soon compelled  to  accept  the  Bishopric  of  that  town. In  the  irruption  of  the  Goths  Nola  was  taken and  the  Saint  held  prisoner  by  the  Barbarians. Twenty  years  later  (A.D.  431)  he  passed  from this  life,  to  the  great  grief  of  his  flock,  and  in universal  repute  as  a  Saint.  His  poems  are still  extant.  

PAULINUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  12) (1st  cent.)  St.  Paulinus  is  venerated  as  the First  Bishop  and  Patron  Saint  of  Lucca  in Tuscany.  He  is  said  to  have  been  sent  thither from  Rome  by  St.  Peter  the  Apostle.  With other  Christians,  he  was  put  to  death  for  the Faith  at  Lucca  at  about  the  same  time  (a.d.  67) as  SS.  Peter  and  Paul  in  Rome.  

PAULINUS  of  YORK  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  10)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Roman  monk  sent  to  England with  SS.  Mellitus  and  Justus  (a.d.  601)  by Pope  St.  Gregory  the  Great,  to  aid  St.  Augustine, the  Apostle  of  the  country,  in  his  labours. Consecrated  Bishop  by  St.  Justus  (a.d.  625), St.  Paulinus  accompanied  the  Kentish  Princess Ethelburga,  who  had  espoused  King  Edwin  of Northumbria,  to  the  North  of  England,  and  as first  Archbishop  of  York,  baptised  the  King and  an  immense  number  of  his  subjects.  He moreover  planted  Christianity  at  Lincoln  and elsewhere  in  the  Midlands.  On  the  death  of Edwin,  Paulinus  again  attended  his  widow  on her  return  to  Kent.  He  died  (a.d.  644)  as Bishop  of  Rochester.  

PAULINUS  of  CAPUA  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  10)  
(9th  cent.)  A  native  of  Great  Britain  who, while  on  a  pilgrimage  to  Jerusalem,  made  a stay  at  Capua  in  Italy,  and  was  constrained by  the  inhabitants,  who  were  edified  by  his piety  and  virtuous  life,  to  become  their  Bishop. During  his  eight  years  of  Episcopate  he  proved himself  a  model  prelate.  He  endeared  himself the  more  to  his  flock  by  his  self-sacrifice  and ability  in  dealing  with  the  needs  of  his  people when  tried  by  a  terrible  famine.  He  died  about A.D.  838.  

♦PAULINUS  (POLIN,  PEWLIN,  PAUL  HEN)  
(St.)  (Nov.  23)  
(5th  cent.)  A  famous  Welsh  Abbot,  pupil of  St.  Illtyd,  celebrated  both  for  piety  and learning.  At  his  monastery,  Whitland  (Caermarthen)  he  had  among  his  disciples  St.  David and  St.  Teilo.  He  died  at  a  great  age  some time  in  the  sixth  century.

PELAGIA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  4)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  young  girl  of  Tarsus  in  Cilicia (Asia  Minor),  who  of  herself  sought  and  obtained Baptism  from  the  Bishop  of  that  city.  Diocletian had  chosen  her  to  be  the  future  bride  of one  of  his  sons.  The  latter,  on  learning  that she  had  become  a  Christian  and  thereby  one of  the  proscribed,  committed  suicide.  St. Pelagia  was  arrested  and  cast  into  prison. In  due  course  she  was  sentenced  to  death, but  she  expired  in  the  torture  chamber.  Her martyrdom  must  be  dated  some  years  before a.d.  300.  

PELAGIA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  9)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  of  Antioch in  Syria  who  suffered  in  the  great  persecution under  Diocletian,  in  the  first  years  of  the fourth  century.  SS.  Ambrose  and  Chrysostom have  both  left  us  Panegyrics  of  her.  "What  is singular  in  her  martyrdom  is  that,  while  she welcomed  the  death  sentence,  rather  than undergo  the  loss  of  her  virginity  (for  to  that she  was  also,  according  to  Roman  Law,  condemned), she  voluntarily  threw  herself  from  a great  height  to  the  ground,  and  so  met  her  death. Butler  thinks  that  she  hoped  to  escape  by  this suicidal  act,  but  writers  on  Theology  should be  consulted  as  to  its  intrinsic  lawfulness.

See  SS.  JANUARIUS  and  PELAGIA.  

PELAGIA  (St.)  Penitent.  (Oct.  8)  
(5th  cent.)  A  public  sinner  of  Antioch  in Syria,  who,  chancing  to  hear  some  words  of  a Sermon  preached  there  by  St.  Nonnus,  Bishop of  Edessa,  was  struck  with  remorse  on  account of  her  evil  life.  She  forthwith  begged  for Baptism,  retired  to  Jerusalem,  and  passed  the remainder  of  her  life  in  the  practice  of  penance in  a  cave  on  Mount  Olivet.  That  she  dressed herself  in  man's  clothes  and  passed  as  a  hermit (a  fancy  of  one  of  her  biographers)  is  against all  evidence,  a.d.  457  is  the  most  likely  date of  her  death.

See  SS.  BERONICUS,  PELAGIA, &c.  

PELAGIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  25)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Laodicea  in  Asia Minor.  He  was  a  zealous  defender  of  the Catholic  Faith  against  the  Arians,  and  on  that account  was  banished  into  Arabia  by  the  heretic Emperor  Valens.  Later  he  was  restored  to  his See,  and  is  by  some  thought  to  have  taken  part in  the  Ecumenical  Council  of  Constantinople (a.d.  381).  

PELAGIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  7)  
(Date  unknown.) A  priest  of  Alexandria  in

nothing  more  is  known.  

PELAGIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  20)  
(10th  cent.)  A  boy  of  ten  or  eleven  years  of age  of  Cordova  in  Spain,  kept  in  prison  for three  years  by  the  Mohammedan  Arabs  as  a hostage,  and  tinally,  on  his  persistent  refusal to  deny  Christ,  put  to  the  torture.  After enduring  this  for  six  hours,  he  passed  to  the enjoyment  of  eternal  life  (A.D.  923).

(3rd  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Constance on  the  Swiss  Lake  of  that  name.  Little  is known  of  him  save  that,  though  a  mere  youth, he  was  put  to  the  torture  and  died  heroically for  the  Christian  Faith  in  the  reign  of  the Emperors  Carinus  and  Numerian,  about  a.d. 283 PELEUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.

Three  Egyptian  Bishops  with many  priests  and  clerics,  burned  to  death  for the  Faith,  in  Palestine,  in  the  persecution  under Diocletian  and  his  colleagues,  about  A.D.  307. They  appear,  previously  to  their  execution,  to have  been  made  to  work  for  some  years  in the  mines,  and  to  have  undergone  the  most  incredible hardships. PELINUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Dec.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  at  Corfinium  (a  town now  destroyed)  in  the  South  of  Italy,  who suffered  death  in  the  persecution  under  Julian the  Apostate,  about  A.D.  361.  There  are  now no  reliable  documents  available  from  which to  sketch  his  career. *PEPIN  of  LANDEN  (Bl.)  (Feb.  21)  
(7th  cent.)  A  powerful  prince,  ancestor  of the  Carolingian  dynasty  of  French  kings.  He was  the  father  of  St.  Gertrude  and  of  St.  Begga, and  appears  to  have  been  a  wise  and  magnanimous ruler.  He  died  A.D.  640.  His  body  is enshrined  at  Nivelle  with  that  of  St.  Gertrude, and  he  has  always  been  in  local  veneration  as  a Saint.

(14th  cent.)  He  was  a  member  of  the  noble family  of  the  Lazioli  in  Central  Italy,  and  early in  life  embraced  the  life  of  the  Servite  Brethren. He  passed  a  long  and  most  holy  life  in  the Servite  convent  of  Forli,  where  he  died  at  the age  of  eighty  (A.d.  1345).  A  wonderful  miracle by  which  he  was  instantaneously  cured  of  a cancer,  which  he  had  long  patiently  borne  with, attracted  popular  veneration  to  him,  even during  his  lifetime,  and  many  miracles  have since  been  wrought  by  Almighty  God  at  his tomb.

He  did  much  for  his  flock,  and  made  numerous converts  to  Christianity  before  enduring  torture for  the  Faith  under  Aurelian  (about  A.D.  273). PEREGRINUS  (St.),  Bp.,  M.  (June  13)  
(6th  cent.)  This  St.  Peregrinus  is  believed to  have  been  a  Bishop  of  Aquila  in  Southern Italy,  and  his  martyrdom  by  drowning  in  the River  Aterno  is  attributed  to  the  savage  cruelty of  the  Arian  Lombards.  It  is  believed  to  have taken  place  about  A.D.  600. PEREGRINUS  (St.)  M.  (June  17)

(2nd  cent.)  St.  Astius  was  Bishop  of  Durazzo in  Macedonia,  and  was  there  crucified  as  a Christian,  early  in  the  second  century.  St. Peregrinus  and  his  companions  were  Italian Christians  who,  flying  from  the  persecution raging  in  their  own  country,  betrayed  themselves in  Macedonia  by  the  sympathy  they  showed for  St.  Astius.  They  were  seized,  loaded  with chains,  taken  to  sea,  and  thrown  overboard. PEREGRINUS  (St.)  (July  28)

NINUS,  and  SECUNDOLUS  (SS.)  MM.  

(March  7)  
(3rd  cent.)  African  Martyrs  under  the Emperor  Septimius  Severus  (a.d.  203).  Their deeply  interesting  Acts,  universally  regarded as  authentic,  have  been  many  times  published, and  fully  detail  their  sufferings.  Perpetua  and Felicitas  were  married  women  of  good  family  ; Revocatus  and  the  others  were  slaves.  They were  all  thrown  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the  Amphitheatre at  Carthage  at  the  public  games  celebrated in  honour  of  the  Emperor's  birthday. PERPETUA  (St.)  (Aug.  4)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Roman  matron,  baptised  by  the Apostle  St.  Peter,  and,  as  a  Christian,  zealous in  good  works.  She  brought  to  the  Light  of the  Faith  her  husband  and  her  son  (the  future Martyr,  St.  Nazarius).  In  all  likelihood  she died  in  Rome,  but  from  early  times  her  sacred relics  have  been  venerated  in  Milan. PERPETUUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  8)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Tours,  remarkable not  only  for  his  zeal  in  the  cause  of  religion, but  also  for  his  sedulous  care  of  the  poor,  in the  helping  of  whom  he  spent  all  his  revenues. He  rebuilt  many  churches  in  his  Diocese  and provided  fitting  shrines  for  the  relics  of  Saints venerated  at  Tours.  He  died  A.D.  490,  having been  Bishop  for  thirty  years. *PERREUX  (St.)  Abbot.  (June  4)

(Date  unknown.)  Very  little  is  known  of this  Saint,  otherwise  called  Pecinna,  or  in French,  PSzaine.  She  appears  to  have  been  a Spanish  maiden,  to  have  died  very  young, to  have  worked  miracles,  and  to  have  been canonised  by  popular  acclamation.  But  the particulars  given  in  the  legendary  life  of  St. Perseveranda  merit  little  attention. PERSIA  (MARTYRS  of).  

In  the  first  centuries  there  existed  a  flourishing Christian  Church  in  Persia.  It  underwent  much persecution  from  the  Pagans,  though  it  also lost  much  by  the  inroads  of  heresy.  There  were veritable  organised  massacres  of  Christians under  some  of  the  Persian  kings.  Frequent entries  in  this  volume  bear  witness  to  this. Some  others,  which  are  not  headed  by  the name  of  anv  particular  Saint,  are  noticed  here. PERSIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (Feb.  8)  
(6th  cent.)  Christian  victims  of  the  intolerance of  a  King  of  Persia  in  the  beginning  of  the sixth century.  It is related that so many 
214 

miracles  were  wrought  through  the  intercession of  these  holy  Martyrs  that  eventually  the terrified  monarch  ceased  from  persecuting  the Christians  of  his  dominions.  

PERSIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (March  10)  
(Date  unknown.)  Forty-two  Christians  put to  death  together  in  early  times  in  Persia. Though  regarded  as  Martyrs,  all  details  concerning them  in  particular  have  long  since  been lost.  

PERSIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (April  6)  
(4th  cent.)  One  hundred  Christian  soldiers, for  the  most  part  Greeks,  made  prisoners  by  the Persian  King  Sapor  II  in  his  war  with  the Emperor  Constantius.  They  were  all  put  to the  sword  by  the  Pagans  and  have  since  been venerated  as  Martyrs.  

PERSIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS  )  (April  22)  
(4th  cent.)  On  April  22  the  Roman  Church commemorates  the  Passion  of  a  vast  number of  Christians,  massacred  in  Persia  under  King Sapor  II  on  Good  Friday,  A.d.  380.  Among them  were  Milles,  Acepsimas,  Mareas,  Bicor and  twenty  other  Bishops,  about  two  hundred and  fifty  priests  and  deacons,  and  very  many monks  and  nuns.  

PERSIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (May  9)  
(Date  uncertain.)  The  Martyrologies  register for  May  9  :  "In  Persia  three  hundred  and  ten Martyrs " ;  but  give  no  indication  of  date. It  is  conjectured  that  they  suffered  in  the  fourth century  under  the  persecuting  King  Sapor  II, but  nothing  certain  is  now  known  about  this particular  group.  An  old  Persian  writer estimates  the  Persian  Martyrs  during  the  reign of  Sapor  II  at  two  thousand.  This  estimate may  be  considered  as  quite  moderate.  Sozomen  the  historian  reckons  them  to  have  numbered sixteen  thousand  ;  but  that  the  total was  (as  some  assert)  two  hundred  thousand seems  exaggerated.

(4th  cent.) A  native  of  Palestine,  arrested 
as  a  Christian  in  Albania  or  in  Greece.  He  was 
put  to  the  torture  and  crucified  about  A.d.  311.  

♦PETER  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  6)  
(7th  cent.)  The  first  Abbot  of  the  monastery founded  by  St.  Augustine  at  Canterbury  and one  of  the  original  fellow-missionaries  in  Kent of  that  Saint.  St.  Peter  died  while  on  an embassy  to  France,  at  Ambleteuse,  near Boulogne  (a.d.  606-607).  His  memory  has been  perpetuated  to  our  own  times,  and  in 1915  his  right  to  a  liturgical  cultus  was  formally recognised  in  Rome.  

PETER  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  A  native  of  Cappadocia  (Asia Minor),  and  younger  brother  of  St.  Basil  and  of St.  Gregory  of  Nyssa.  Appointed  Bishop  of Sebaste  in  Armenia,  he  was  conspicuous  for  his zeal  in  defence  of  the  Faith  against  the  Arians. He  took  part  in  the  General  Council  of  Constantinople (A.D.  381).  He  died  (A.D.  387)  in the  eighth  year  of  his  Episcopate,  and  was  at once  invoked  as  a  Saint  by  his  sorrowing  flock.  

PETER  URSEOLUS  (St.)  (Jan.  10)  
(10th  cent.)  A  Doge  of  Venice  who,  after some  years  of  successful  administration  of  the Republic,  renounced  his  dignity  and  embraced the  Religious  life  in  a  Benedictine  monastery in  the  Pyranees.  Having  lived  there  in poverty  and  penance  to  the  age  of  sixty-nine, he  died  a.d.  997.  An  accusation  made  against him  in  the  Middle  Ages  to  the  effect  that  he entered  the  monastery  out  of  remorse  for  having been  accessory  to  the  murder  of  his  predecessor at  Venice  has  been  proved  to  be  baseless.  

PETER,  SEVERUS  and  LEUCIUS  (SS.)  

MM.  (Jan.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  African  or  Egyptian  Martyrs  of 
whom  nothing  is  now  known  except  that  they 
suffered as Christians at Alexandria, about 
a.d.  309.

PETER  NOLASCUS  (St.)  (Jan.  31)  
(13th  cent.)  The  Founder  of  the  Order  of Out  Lady  of  Ransom,  whose  work  was  the rescuing  of  Christians  kept  in  slavery  by  the Moors.  Born  near  Toulouse,  he  fought  for  a time  on  the  Catholic  side  against  the  Albigenses. He  afterwards  went  to  Spain,  and  there,  aided by  St.  Raymund  de  Pennafort,  took  up  his lifework.  By  unceasing  toil  he  is  said  to  have freed  over  three  thousand  Christians  from  a captivity  worse  than  death.  He  passed  away at  Barcelona  on  Christmas  Day,  A.d.  1250.  

♦PETER  CAMBIAN  (Bl.)  M.  (Feb.  2)  
(14th  cent.)  A  Dominican  Saint,  zealous  in the  endeavour  of  his  Order  to  convert  the Waldensian  or  Vaudois  heretics.  He  was  murdered by  them  at  Susa  in  Piedmont,  a.d.  1365.  

PETER  IGNEUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  8)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Tuscan  Saint,  monk  of  the Order  of  Vallombrosa,  who  ultimately  became Cardinal  Bishop  of  Albano.  He  gained  the name  of  "  Igneus  (Of  the  Fire),"  from  his having  miraculously  without  hurt  walked through  the  flames  in  a  trial  by  ordeal,  usual (except  in  Rome)  in  his  Age.  He  co-operated zealously  with  Pope  St.  Gregory  VII  in  that Saint's  endeavours  to  repress  simony  and  to reform  Church  discipline.  He  died  a.d.  1089.  

PETER  MAVIMENUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  21)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Damascus, 
zealous  for  his  religion,  and  on  that  account 
put to death by the Mohammedan Arabs 
(A.D.  743,  about).  

PETER  DAMIAN  (St.)  Bp.,  Doctor  (Feb.  23)  

of  the  Church.  

(11th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  distinguished Ecclesiastics  of  the  calamitous  times  in  which he  lived.  He  was  remarkable  for  his  learning and  for  his  business  abilities,  as  well  as  for  his piety  and  austerity  of  life.  He  was  an  Italian, born  at  Ravenna,  and  a  monk  of  Fonte  Avellano, whence  he  rose  to  be  Cardinal  Bishop  of  Ostia. He  was  counsellor  to  several  successive  Popes, notably  in  their  dealings  with  the  Kings  of France  and  with  the  unprincipled  Henry  IV, Emperor  of  Germany.  St.  Peter  died  at Faenza  (a.d.  1072),  at  the  age  of  eighty-three. His  Works  have  passed  through  many  editions.  

♦PETER  of  CASTELNAU  (Bl.)  M.  (March  5)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Cistercian  Saint,  born  of  a noble  family  in  the  South  of  France,  and  the friend  of  St.  Dominic.  He  was  admirable  in his  zeal  for  the  conversion  of  the  Albigensian heretics.  They  murdered  him  a.d.  1209.  

PETER  (St.)  (March  -40)
(Date unknown.) A Spanish Saint who, 
crossing  over  to  Italy,  led  the  life  of  a  hermit 
near  Veroli,  and  at  whose  tomb  many  miracles 
have  taken  place.  

PETER  (St.)  M.  (March  12)  
(4th  cent.)  An  official  of  the  Court  of  the Emperor  Diocletian  who  endured  frightful tortures,  and  in  the  end  allowed  himself  to  be thrown  into  a  fiercely  burning  furnace,  rather than  betray  his  Lord.  He  suffered  at  Nicomedia,  the  Imperial  Residence,  A.d.  303.  

PETER  and  APHRODISIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  14) (Date  unknown.)  African  Martyrs  who suffered  under  the  Arian  Vandals  in  the  second half  of  the  fifth  or  early  in  the  sixth  century. All  records  dealing  with  them  have  been  lost. Hence  there  are  disputes  among  the  learned as  to  whether  one  or  the  other  of  them  was not  an  Asiatic  who  perished  in  an  earlier persecution.  Some  manuscripts  have  "  Euphrasius  "  in  place  of  "  Aphrodisius." 
PETER,  MARCIAN,  JOVINUS,  THECLA,  CASSIAN and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  26)  
(Date  unknown.)  Roman  Martyrs,  concerning whom  it  has  been  found  impossible  to disentangle  dates  and  places.  Some  of  them are  said  to  have  been  Bishops.  Certain  Registers write  "  Theodula  "  for  "  Thecla." 
♦PETER  GONZALEZ  (ELMO)  (St.)  (April  15)  
(13th cent.)  A Spanish Dominican Saint, 

famous  for  his  humility  of  heart  and  for  the reforms  he  effected  in  the  Court  of  King  Ferdinand III.  When  Cordova  was  recovered from  the  Moors,  his  prayers  and  influence obtained  kindly  treatment  for  its  Mohammedan inhabitants.  He  laboured  much  in  seaports and  among  sailors.  Seafaring  men  in  Spain look  up  to  Blessed  Peter  as  their  special  Protector. By  some  misunderstanding,  they  have come  to  invoke  him  as  St.  Elmo,  the  name  of the  far  more  ancient  Saint,  St.  Erasmus,  the once  recognised  Patron  Saint  of  seamen.  Bl. Peter  died  a.d.  1240.  

PETER  and  HERMOGENES  (SS.)  MM.  (April  17)  
(Date unknown.) Martyrs at Antioch in 
Syria.  St.  Peter  was  a  deacon  and  St.  Hermo
genes is described as his servant.  Nothing 
more  is  now  known  about  them.  

PETER  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  26)  
(Date  unknown.) The  first  Bishop  of  Braga 
in  Portugal.  We  have  no  reliable  particulars 
concerning  him.  Some  place  him  as  early  as 
the  age  of  the  Apostles.  

♦PETER  CANISIUS  (Bl.)  (April  26)  
(16th  cent.)  One  of  the  first  companions  of St.  Ignatius.  A  German  by  birth,  as  a  Jesuit, he  laboured  much  against  Protestantism  in  his Fatherland,  and  played  a  prominent  part  at the  Council  of  Trent.  He  died  at  Friburg  in Switzerland,  Dec.  21,  a.d.  1597.  

PETER  ARMANGAUD  (St.)  M.  (April  27)  
(14th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Saint  who,  in atonement  for  the  sinfulness  of  his  early  life, devoted  himself  heroically  to  the  work  of liberating  Christians  held  in  slavery  by  the Moors,  for  which  purpose  he  obtained  admission to  the  Order  of  Our  Lady  of  Ransom.  He  had already  rescued  one  hundred  and  nineteen Christians,  when  he  felt  inspired  to  offer  himself as  pledge  or  hostage  for  eighteen  Christian children.  Through  some  mishap,  the  ransom for  these  was  not  paid  at  the  stipulated  date, and  the  Saint  was  hanged.  But  on  that  very same  day,  an  hour  or  so  later,  the  ransom reached  Algiers,  and  the  holy  man  taken  down from  the  gibbet  was  found  to  be  still  breathing. Conducted  back  to  Spain,  he  lingered  on  for another  ten  years,  dying  a.d.  1304.  

♦PETER  CHANEL  (Bl.)  M.  (April  28)  
(19th  cent.)  A  French  priest  of  the  Marist Order,  a  missionary  in  Oceania,  who  was savagely  done  to  death  by  the  heathen  inhabitants of  the  island  of  Fotuna  (April  28,  A.D. 1841).  His  martyrdom,  by  a  wonderful miracle,  was  immediately  followed  by  the all  but  entire  conversion  of  the  island  to Christianity.  

PETER  (St.)  M.  (April  29)  
(13th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  famous  of Dominican  Saints.  He  was  an  Italian,  but born  of  heretical  parents.  Received  into  the Dominican  Order  by  St.  Dominic  himself,  he  at once  became  a  model  of  prayer  and  penance. His  lifework  was  the  conversion  of  the  Cathari or  Manichseans,  then  swarming  in  the  North  of Italy.  He  was  instrumental  in  the  saving  of countless  souls,  until  at  length  the  heretics succeeded  in  waylaying  him,  while  on  a  journey, and  in  murdering  him  on  the  road  from  Como to  Milan  (a.d.  1252),  he  being  then  in  his forty-seventh  year.  

PETER  (St.)  M.  (April  30)  

See  SS.  AMATOR,  PETER, &c.  

PETER  (St.)  Bp.  (May  7)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Pavia  in  Lombardy, in  the  time  of  his  kinsman,  Luitprand,  King of  the  Lombards.  He  died  after  a  short Episcopate,  renowned  for  his  virtues  and miracles,  about  A.D.  735.  

PETER  of  TARANTAISE  (St.)  Bp.  (May  8)  
(12th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  a  Cistercian monk,  afterwards  Archbishop  of  Tarantaise (Moutiers)  in  Savoy.  He  was  devoted  to  his flock,  founded  several  hospitals,  and  was earnest  in  the  reform  of  Church  discipline.  He

PETER 
was  employed  more  than  once  as  Legate  by  the Popes  of  his  time,  and  succeeded  in  impressing by  his  sanctity  even  King  Henry  II  of  England. He  died  in  a  monastery  near  Besanc.on,  a.d. 1174,  at  the  age  of  seventy-three.  

PETER  REGALATUS  (St.)  (May  13)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Spaniard  of  noble  birth  in Valladolid  who  entered  the  Franciscan  Order and  effected  many  important  reforms  in  the discipline  of  its  Spanish  monasteries.  He reintroduced  not  a  few  austerities  which  had fallen  into  disuse.  His  great  devotion  was  the care  of  the  helpless  poor  and  of  the  forsaken sick.  He  died  on  Easter  Monday,  A.D.  1456, and  was  canonised  three  hundred  years  later by  Pope  Benedict  XIV.  

PETER,  PAUL,  ANDREW  and  DIONYSIA 
(SS.)  MM.  (May  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  Christians  who  were  put  to  death at  Lampsacus  on  the  Hellespont,  under  the Emperor  Decius  (A.D.  250).  They  seem  to have  been  stoned  by  the  heathen  rabble,  with the  consent  of  the  magistrates,  before  whom  they had  bravely  confessed  their  Faith  in  Christ.  

PETER  CELESTINE  (St.)  Pope.  (May  19)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Benedictine  monk  or  hermit, Founder  of  the  Congregation  called  after  him Celestinians.  He  was  born  in  the  Abruzzi (Southern  Italy)  A.D.  1221 ;  and  as  a  Religious became  so  renowned  for  sanctity  of  life  that, after  the  death  of  Pope  Nicholas  IV,  the Cardinals  compelled  him  to  accept  the  Tiara (A.D.  1294).  But  four  months  later  he resigned  this  highest  of  earthly  dignities  and returned  to  his  monastery  on  Mount  Morrone (whence  his  name,  Peter  of  Morrone).  His successor,  Pope  Boniface  VIII,  fearing  lest the  simple  old  Saint  should  be  made  the  tool of  schismatics,  removed  him  to  a  castle  near Anagni,  where  he  survived  till  A.D.  1296.  He was  canonised  by  Clement  V  (a.d.  1313). Dante  and  others  have  judged  St.  Peter  Celestine harshly  and  unfairly,  but  history  and  the veneration  of  the  Church  have  amply  justified his  memory.  

PETER  of  PISA  (St.)  (June  1)  
(15th  cent.)  The  Founder  in  Italy  of  the Order  of  the  Hermits  of  St.  Jerome,  an  Institute of  great  austereness  of  life,  later  approved  by the  Holy  See.  The  Saint  died  A.D.  1435  at  the age  of  eighty.

See  SS.  MARCELLINUS  and  PETER.  

PETER,  WALLABONSUS,  SABINIAN,  WISTRE
MUNDUS,  HABENTIUS and  JEREMIAS 
(S.S.)  MM.  (June  7)  
(9th  cent.) Monks  from  the  neighbourhood 
of  Cordova  (Spain),  put  to  death  as  Christians 
on  one  day  (a.d.  851)  by  the  Mohammedan 
Arabs,  then  masters  of  Spain.  They  were  all 
beheaded.  St. Eulogius, a  contemporary 
writer,  adds  that  a  few  days  afterwards  the 
Arabs burned their bodies and threw their 
ashes  into  the  Guadalquivir,  lest  the  Christians 
should  recover  and  venerate  them.  

PETER  THE  APOSTLE  (St.)  (June  29)  
(1st  cent.)  Simon  Peter,  the  Fisherman  of Galilee,  was  called  with  Andrew,  his  brother, the  first  of  the  Apostles,  and  left  by  Christ  to be  the  Rock  on  which  His  Church  had  to  be built.  As  Vicar  of  His  Lord,  he  was  the  First of  the  Popes.  The  Gospels  tell  us  of  his  threefold denial  and  of  his  repentance.  He  presided over  the  Council  of  the  Apostles  at  Jerusalem (Acts  xv.),  and  was  the  inspired  writer  of  two canonical  Epistles.  He  established  the  seat of  the  Papacy,  first  at  Antioch,  and  afterwards in  Rome,  where  he  suffered  martyrdom  (being crucified,  it  is  said,  head  downwards)  under Nero,  June  29,  A.D.  67.  His  shrine  is  in  St. Peter's,  Rome.  Three  Feasts  besides  that  of his  Martyrdom  are  kept  by  the  Church :  that of  his  chains  and  miraculous  deliverance  from prison  ;  that  of  His  Chair  at  Antioch  ;  and  that of  His  Chair  in  Rome. 216 

♦PETER  of  ASTI  (St.)  (June  30)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  lay-brother  of  the Benedictine  monastery  of  Asti  in  Piedmont, who  by  his  prayerful  life  approved  by  the  gift of  working  miracles,  earned  a  place  among  the Saints  venerated  in  that  city.  

♦PETER  of  METZ  (St.)  Bp.  (July  5)  
(14th  cent.)  A  nobleman  of  Luxembourg, for  some  time  a  prisoner  or  hostage  in  England. He  afterwards  embraced  the  Ecclesiastical state  and  became  Archbishop  of  Metz  and Cardinal.  He  illustrated  these  high  dignities by  his  holy  and  humble  manner  of  life.  He died  a.d.  1387,  and  was  canonised  a.d.  1527.  

PETER  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  1)  

See  SS.  CYRIL,  AQUILA, &c.  

PETER  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  3)  
(12th  cent.)  A  holy  monk  of  Salerno  on  the Bay  of  Naples,  who,  at  the  instance  of  Hildebrand,  afterwards  St.  Gregory  VII,  was  appointed Bishop  of  Anagni.  St.  Peter  died, illustrious  for  his  pastoral  zeal  and  for  miracles in  the  forty-fourth  year  of  his  Episcopate, early  in  the  twelfth  century.  St.  Bruno,  his successor,  declared  him  a  Saint,  and  this judgment  was  shortly  after  ratified  by  Pope 
PETER,  JULIAN  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  7) (3rd  cent.)  Twenty  or  more  victims  of  the persecution  in  Rome  under  the  Emperors  Valerian and  Gallienus  (about  a.d.  260).  They  are registered  in  all  the  ancient  Marty rologies, but  their  Acts  have  not  come  down  to  our time.  

♦PETER  FABER  (Bl.)  (Aug.  8)  
(16th  cent.)  The  first  of  his  holy  companions to  be  admitted  to  the  Society  of  Jesus  by  St. Ignatius,  its  Founder.  Bl.  Peter  was  a  Savoyard by  birth.  He  laboured  all  his  life-long against  the  sixteenth  century  heretics,  and died  in  Rome  when  about  to  take  part  in  the Council  of  Trent  (Aug.  1,  a.d.  1546).  

PETER  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  27)  

See  SS.  MARCELLINA,  MANNEA, &c.  

PETER  of  TREVI  (St.)  (Aug.  30)  
(11th  cent.)  An  Italian  priest,  remarkable for  his  success  as  a  preacher  and  the  Apostle of  the  neighbourhood  of  Tivoli,  Anagni  and Subiaco,  where  his  zeal  and  example  rescued many  thousands  of  the  country  people  from lives  of  sin.  He  died  in  the  little  town  of  Trevi about  a.d.  1060.  Because  of  the  dress  he  wore he  is  often  styled  "  the  Hermit "  ;  but,  of course,  is  not  to  be  confused  with  his  famous contemporary,  Peter  the  Hermit,  the  preacher of  the  Crusades.  

PETER  CLAVER  (St.)  (Sept.  9)  
(17th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Jesuit,  for  forty  years missionary  in  South  America,  where  he  laboured for  the  salvation  of  the  African  Negroes  and  for the  abolition  of  the  slave  trade.  He  died Sept.  8,  a.d.  1654,  and  was  canonised  by  Pope Leo  XIII  as  "  Apostle  of  the  Negroes." 
PETER  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  10)  
(Date  unknown.)  Registered  in  modern editions  of  the  Roman  Martyrology  as  Bishop of  Compostella  in  Spain ;  but  his  name  does not  appear  in  the  more  ancient  catalogues  of Saints,  nor  is  there  any  other  record  of  him. Hence,  the  Bollandists  and  other  moderns think  the  insertion  to  be  due  to  a  mistake.  

PETER  of  ARBUES  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  17)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Spaniard  of  noble  birth  and a  very  learned  man,  who  became  a  Canon Regular  of  the  Order  of  St.  Augustine.  Under Ferdinand  and  Isabella,  he  distinguished himself  by  his  zeal  in  the  work  of  converting Jews  and  heretics.  But  some  of  their  leaders plotted  and  compassed  his  death.  He  was murdered  at  their  instigation  in  the  Cathedral of  Saragossa  (a.d.  1485)  while  engaged  in chanting  the  Divine  Office.  He  was  canonised (A.D.  1867)  by  Pope  Pius  IX.

See  SS.  DIONYSIUS,  FAUSTUS, &c. PETER  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  4)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Damascus,  a  man of  most  holy  life,  driven  into  exile  and  afterwards put  to  death,  out  of  hatred  of  the  Christian religion,  by  the  Mohammedan  Arabs,  about the  middle  of  the  eighth  century. PETER  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  8)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Saint  of  whom  nothing is  now  known,  save  that  Usuardus  the  martyrologist  (A.D.  858)  found  his  name  among  those of  the  Saints  venerated  at  Seville  in  Spain. Certain  super-added  legendary  details  are quite  unauthentic. PETER  of  ALCANTARA  (St.)  (Oct.  19)  
(16th  cent.)  One  of  the  famous  Spanish Mystics  (St.  Teresa,  St.  John  of  the  Cross, Blessed  John  of  Avila,  &c.)  who  are  the  glory of  the  age  of  the  disastrous  Protestant  rebellion against  the  Church  in  the  North  of  Europe. St.  Peter  was  a  Franciscan  and  originated  one of  the  strictest  Reforms  of  his  Order.  His short  Treatise  on  Prayer  was  much  valued  by St.  Francis  of  Sales  and  other  Masters  of  the Interior  Life  ;  but  St.  Peter  is  perhaps  chiefly celebrated  for  the  incredible  austerities  he practised,  and  for  his  marvellous  gift  of  supernatural communion  with  God.  He  is  also gratefully  to  be  remembered  for  the  encouragement he  gave  to  St.  Teresa.  He  died  A.D.  1562 at  the  age  of  sixty-three. PETER  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  25)  

See  SS.  THEODOSIUS,  LUCIUS, &c. PETER  of  ALEXANDRIA  (St.)  Bp.,  M. (Nov.  26)  
(4th  cent.)  A  learned  and  holy  Prelate  who governed  the  great  Church  of  Alexandria  in Egypt  for  twelve  years  in  very  troubled  times. He  had  to  face  the  dangerous  schism  of  Meletius among  his  own  clergy  at  the  very  time  when  the comforting  and  guiding  of  Christians  in  peril of  death  at  the  hands  of  heathen  persecutors called  for  the  exercise  of  all  his  energies.  He seems  to  have  been  the  first  to  detect  the incipient  heresy  of  Arius.  St.  Peter  was  put to  death  by  order  of  the  Csesar  Maximin  Daza, together  with  other  Christians  (a.d.  311),  and was  succeeded  by  St.  Alexander,  the  predecessor of  the  great  St.  Athanasius.

(5th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Ravenna, preferred  to  that  See,  the  residence  in  Italy of  the  Exarch  or  Imperial  representative,  by Pope  Xystus  III.  He  took  considerable  part in  the  controversies  of  his  time,  and  rendered important  services  to  the  Church.  But  he  is chiefly  famed  for  his  assiduity  and  eloquence in  preaching,  whence  the  name  given  him, "  Chrysologus  (Golden  Speech). "  He  died  in the  eleventh  year  of  his  Episcopate  (a.d.  450). PETER  PASCHASIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Dec.  6)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Saint,  Religious  of the  Order  of  Our  Lady  of  Ransom.  He  was  a pious  and  learned  man,  sometime  tutor  to  the son  of  the  King  of  Aragon.  He  was  appointed Bishop  of  Jaen  (a.d.  1296).  Four  years  later,  at Granada,  he  fell  into  the  power  of  the  Infidel Moors,  by  whom  he  was  nut  to  death  on  St. Stephen's  day  (Dec.  26)  a.d.  1230. PETER  FOURIER  (St.)  (Dec.  9)  
(17th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  the  Order  of  Canons Regular,  born  in  Lorraine,  and  remarkable  for his  zeal  and  devotedness  as  a  parish  priest. He  is  best  known  as  the  Reformer  of  the discipline  of  his  own  Order  and  as  the  Founder of  the  Congregation  of  the  Canonesses  of  Notre Dame.  Meekness  and  charity  were  his  characteristic virtues.  He  died  a.d.  1646  at  the  age of  seventy-five.  The  many  miracles  worked tlirough  his  intercession  in  life  and  after  death led  to  his  Beatification  and  Canonisation  in A.D.  1730  and  A.D.  1897. 

PETER,  SUCCESSUS,  BASSIANUS,  PRIMITIVUS and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  9)  
(Date  unknown.) Martyrs  in  Africa, concerning whom we know only their names registered  in  the  ancient  catalogues  of  Martyrs. *PETROCK  (PETROC,  PERREUX)  (June  4)  
(St.)  Abbot.  

(6th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  illustrious  of the  old  British  Saints.  He  was  the  son  of  a Welsh  chieftain  ;  and,  after  studying  in  Ireland, founded  a  monastery  in  Cornwall  at  a  place called  after  him,  Petrockstowe  (Padstow),  and another  at  Bodmin,  where  he  closed  his  holy life  (A.D.  564).  In  Brittany,  where  are  some  of his  relics,  he  is  venerated  under  the  name  of 
PETRONILLA  (St.)  V.  (May  31)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Roman  virgin,  converted  to Christianity  by  the  Apostle  St.  Peter,  and  who afterwards  ministered  to  him  until  her  death at  an  early  age.  The  name  Petronilla  (a diminutive  of  Petronia)  from  its  similarity  with the  derivatives  from  Peter  (Petrus),  probably led  to  the  belief  that  she  was  St.  Peter's  daughter, whereas  she  was  only  his  spiritual  or adopted  child. PETRONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  6)  
(5th cent.)  One of  the numerous sainted Bishops  of  Verona  in  Italy.  He  is  described  as the  wonder  of  his  time  and  country,  on  account of  his  piety,  learning  and  eloquence. PETRONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  4)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  in  Constantinople,  he  was sent  by  the  Emperor  Theodosius  the  Younger to  report  to  Pope  St.  Celestine  on  the  case  of the  heretic  Nestor ius.  While  in  Italy  he  was promoted,  notwithstanding  his  reluctance,  to the  Archbishopric  of  Bologna,  of  which  great See  he  is  looked  upon  as  the  most  distinguished ornament.  He  did  much  good  to  his  Church and  flock,  and  died,  famous  also  for  the  working of  miracles  (a.d.  450). PH^BADIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  25)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Agen  in  the  South of  France,  distinguished  on  the  Catholic  side in  the  controversy  with  the  Arians.  He  has left  us  some  valuable  writings  in  defence  of  the Faith.  He  appears  to  have  lived  to  a  great age  and  to  have  been  still  alive  in  a.d.  392. *PHAGANUS  (FAGAN)  (St.)  (Jan.  6)

(8th  cent.)  One  of  the  Patron  Saints  of  Ghent. She  was  a  sister  of  St.  Gudula,  and  was  brought up  by  St.  Gertrude  of  Nivelle.  After  a  devoted and  most  austere  life  she  died  at  the  age  of ninety,  about  a.d.  745. PHARNACIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  24)

(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  whose  Passion  is  related by  the  contemporary  historian  Eusebius.  St. Philseas  was  Bishop  of  Thumuis,  an  ancient city  of  Lower  Egypt.  He  was  beheaded,  on account  of  his  religion,  under  Diocletian  about a.d.  306.  With  him  suffered  St.  Philoromus, an  Imperial  officer  of  distinction. Their  execu

tion  had  been  preceded  by  the  doing  to  death of  numerous  Christians,  inhabitants  of  Thumuis and  its  neighbourhood.  To  their  heroic constancy  in  the  Faith,  St.  Philseas  himself bears  Witness  in  a  letter  Eusebius  has  preserved to  us. PHILAPIANUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  30)  

See  SS.  FELICIAN,  PHILAPIANUS, Ac. PHILASTRIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  18)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Spaniard,  made  Bishop  of Brescia  in  Italy  in  the  time  of  the  Arian  troubles. He  has  left  some  controversial  Tracts  ;  but  the little  we  know  of  him  we  gather  from  a  Panegyric of  his  #nany  virtues,  preached  on  his anniversary  by  Gaudentius,  his  successor,  which is  still  extant.  He  was  "  patient,  good  to  the poor,  merciful  and  affable  to  all." PHILEAS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Nov.  26)  

See  SS.  FAUSTUS,  DIDIUS, &c. PHILEMON  and  APOLLONIUS  (March  8)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Egyptian  Christians  who  suffered in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian  (about  A. p. 303).  St.  Apollonius,  a  deacon,  had  converted Philemon,  a  man  of  note  in  public  life,  to  Christianity. They  were  brought  from  Antinoe  to Alexandria,  and  were  there  put  to  death  with many  others  who  had  become  believers  in Christ.  It  is  most  probable  that  their  fate was  to  be  bound  hand  and  foot  and  to  be  cast into  the  sea. PHILEMON  and  APPHIAS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  22)  
(1st  cent.)  St.  Philemon  is  the  Christian  of Colosse,  master  of  the  slave,  Onesimus,  to  whom St.  Paul  addressed  his  canonical  Epistle. Apphias  was  also  a  disciple  of  St.  Paul.  In the  time  of  the  Emperor  Nero,  the  building used  as  a  Chapel  or  Oratory  by  the  Christians of  Colosse  was  broken  into  by  the  Pagans.  The rest  of  the  congregation  fled  in  time,  but Philemon  and  Apphias  were  seized  and  stoned to  death. PHILETAS,  LYDIA,  MACEDO,  THEOPREPIDES, 
AMPHILOCHIUS  and  CRONIDAS  (March  27)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(2nd  cent.)  These  Martyrs  appear  to  have been  Greeks.  Philetas  is  described  as  of senatorial  rank.  Lydia  was  his  wife,  and Macedo  and  Theoprepides  their  children.  The other  two  were  personages  occupying  conspicuous official  positions.  They  all  suffered  together as  Christians  in  the  time  of  the  Emperor Hadrian  (about  a.d.  121),  and,  it  is  related, were  thrown  into  caldrons  of  boiling  oil. PHILIBERT  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  20)  
(7th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  Founder  of  the Abbey  of  Jumieges,  and  later  of  that  of Hermoustier,  where  he  died  (A.D.  684).  He appears  to  have  imposed  on  his  monks  the  stern Rule  of  St.  Columbanus.  Their  chief  work  was the  reclaiming  of  waste  lands.  St.  Philibert led  a  life  of  great  suffering,  and  more  than  once was  driven  into  exile  by  the  lawless  potentates of  his  age. PHILIBERT  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  

See  SS.  FABRICIANUS  and  PHILIBERT. PHILIP  of  JESUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  5)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Franciscan  Saint,  born  in Mexico  of  Spanish  parents,  who  in  a  voyage from  Manilla  to  North  America  was  forced  by a  storm  to  land  in  Japan,  where  the  great persecution  was  about  to  begin.  Philip  was crucified  as  a  Christian  (a.d.  1597),  and  is venerated  as  the  first  Martyr  of  Japan.  His cultus  is  widely  spread  in  North  America. PHILIP  (St.)  Bp.  (April  11)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Bishop  in  the  Island  of  Crete, to  whose  eminent  sanctity  St.  Dionysius  of Corinth  bears  witness  in  his  Epistle  to  the Faithful  of  Gortyna.  St.  Philip  wrote  against the  Marcionite  heretics.  His  works,  much esteemed  by  the  ancients,  are  now  lost. PHILIP  THE  APOSTLE  (St.)  (May  1)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  Twelve,  a  native  of Bethsaida,  and  several  times  mentioned  in  the 
218 

Gospels.  After  the  Ascension,  he  is  believed to  have  preached  Christianity  in  Asia  Minor  and to  have  laid  down  his  life  for  Christ  at  Hierapolis in  Phrygia  (a.d.  80).  His  relics  are  venerated in  Rome.  

♦PHILIP  (St.)  Hermit.  (May  3)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  Saint  who, returning  from  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome,  built himself  a  hermitage  in  the  neighbourhood  of Worms  (Germany),  and  thence  ministered  to the  spiritual  needs  of  the  neighbouring  villages.  

PHILIP  of  AGIRONE  (St.)  (May  12)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  holy  missionary  sent  by the  Holy  See  to  preach  the  Gospel  in  Sicily, and  to  whom  the  conversion  to  Christianity of  a  great  part  of  the  island  is  attributed.  His shrine  is  in  the  little  hill-town  of  Agirone. The  legends  concerning  him  are  so  contradictory, and  in  most  part  so  improbable,  that  they afford  no  firm  ground  for  the  work  of  the historian.  

PHILIP  NERI  (St.)  (May  26)  
(16th  cent.)  One  of  the  famous  Saints  of his  time.  Born  in  Florence  (a.d.  1515),  he studied  in  Rome,  and  there  received  the  priesthood. Thenceforth  he  gave  himself  up  wholly to  working  for  the  salvation  of  souls,  and  with such  success  as  to  earn  the  title  of  "  Apostle  of Rome."  His  spirit  of  zeal  he  perpetuated  by founding  the  Congregation  of  secular  priests known  as  Cratorians.  Almighty  God  enriched him  with  gifts  of  prophecy,  of  insight  into  souls, and  other  supernatural  powers.  He  died  a.d. 1595, and  was canonised  twenty-eight years 
PHILIP  THE  DEACON  (St.)  (June  6)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  seven  deacons  ordained by  the  Apostles  (Acts  vi.  5).  He  converted  the Samaritans,  baptised  the  eunuch  of  Candaces, Queen  of  Ethiopia  (Acts  viii.),  and  was  the host  of  St.  Paul  at  Csesarea  (Acts  xxi.  8). His  four  daughters  (Acts  xxi.  9)  are  honoured as  Saints  with  him.  There  is  a  tradition  among the  Greeks  that  St.  Philip  became  Bishop  of Tralles  in  Lydia  (Asia  Minor),  and  there  suffered martyrdom. PHILIP,  ZENO,  NARSEUS  and  OTHERS  (July  15)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  A  group  of  thirteen  Martyrs done  to  death  for  Christ's  sake  at  Alexandria in  Egypt  in  one  of  the  early  persecutions. Ten  of  them  were  little  children,  but  all records  of  particulars  have  long  since  perished. PHILIP  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  17)  

See  SS.  STRATON,  PHILIP, &c. PHILIP  BENIZI  (St.)  (Aug.  23)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Florentine  Saint,  the  ornament and  great  propagator  of  the  then  newly founded  Order  of  Servites,  in  which  he  made his  Religious  Profession  (a.d.  1243),  in  due time  becoming  its  Father  General.  St.  Philip was  not  only  wonderful  for  his  sanctity  of  life, but  also  a  learned  and  exceedingly  able  man, so  much  so  that  the  Cardinals  chose  him  for Pope  at  the  death  of  Clement  IV.  This  dignity, however,  he  in  his  humility  declined.  He  died at  Todi,  August  22,  A.D.  1285. PHILIP  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  2)  

See  SS.  DIOMEDES,  JULIAN,  &c. PHILIP  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  father  of  St.  Eugenia,  in whose  household  SS.  Protus  and  Hyacinth  were employed.  St.  Philip  was  of  high  rank  and occupied  a  post  of  importance  at  Alexandria  in Egvpt.  It  was  there  that  he  gave  his  life  for Christ,  but  in  which  of  the  third  century persecutions  is  uncertain. PHILIP,  SEVERUS,  EUSEBIUS  and  HERMES 
(SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  22)  
(4th  cent.)  St.  Philip  was  Bishop  of  Heraclea near  Constantinople.  St.  Severus  was  his deacon  ;  SS.  Eusebius  and  Hermes,  two  of  the inferior  clergy.  During  the  persecution  under Diocletian  they  were  all  arrested  and  brought to  trial.  It  was  insistently  demanded  of  them 
PHOTIUS 

that  they  should  deliver  up  the  Sacred  Books of  the  Church  to  be  burned.  On  their  refusal and  steadfastness  in  confessing  Christ,  they were  taken  to  Adrianople,  and  there,  after torture,  burned  at  the  stake  (A. p.  304).  We have  a  copy  of  the  legal  process  instituted  against them,  a  source  of  information  always  reliable for  details.  By  an  oversight,  the  recent  editions of  the  Roman  Martyrology  register  these  Martyrs as  having  suffered  under  Julian,  thus  post-dating their  martyrdom  by  some  sixty  years. PHILIP  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Oct.  22)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Bishop  of  Fermo  in Italy  of  whom  little  is  known,  but  whose martyrdom  appears  to  have  taken  place  about the  middle  of  the  third  century.  His  relics  are enshrined  in  his  Cathedral. PHILIPPA  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  20)  

See  SS.  THEODORE,  PHILIPPA, &c. PHILO  and  AGATHOPODES  (SS.)  (April  25)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  two  deacons  of  Antioch  who (A.D.  107)  attended  St.  Ignatius,  their  illustrious Bishop,  to  his  martyrdom  in  Rome.  They took  back  to  Antioch  such  relics  of  the  Saint  as they  were  able  to  recover,  and  are  believed  to have  written  the  Acts  or  Description  of  his  trial and  death. PHILOGONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  The  Bishop  of  Antioch  who, with  St.  Alexander  of  Alexandria,  first  detected and  denounced  the  Arian  heresy.  He  had,  in the  later  years  of  the  persecution  under  Licinius, suffered  imprisonment  for  the  Eaith.  He  died A.D.  323,  and  as  early  as  A.D.  386  we  find  St. John  Chrysostom  preaching  the  Panegyric  of St.  Philogonius  on  the  latter's  Feast  Day. The  holy  Doctor's  Homily  is  still  extant. PHILOLOGUS  and  PATROBAS  (SS.)  (Nov.  4)  
(1st  cent.) Roman  Christians,  specially saluted  by  St.  Paul  (Rom.  xvi  14,  15). Tradition has  it  that  later  they  were  both  appointed to  Bishoprics,  probably  in  the  South  of  Italy. PHILOMENA  (St.)  V.  (July  5)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Saint  venerated  at  San Severino  (Septempeda),  near  Ancona.  Nothing is  now  known  of  her  except  from  an  inscription on  her  tomb  discovered  in  the  thirteenth century.  It  gives  her  name  and  shows  that she  must  have  lived  before  A.D.  500.
♦PHILOMENA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  6)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Early  in  the  nineteenth century  the  body  of  "  Philumena,"  VirginMartyr,  was  discovered  in  the  Roman  Catacomb known  as  the  Cemetery  of  Priscilla,  together with  the  usual  phial  of  blood.  The  many  and extraordinary  miracles  wrought  after  prayer has  been  made  to  this  unknown  Saint  has  led to  a  propagation  of  her  cultus  throughout  the Catholic  world.

S>e  SS.  CLEMENTINUS,  THEODOTUS,  Ac. PHILOMENUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  29)  
(3rd  cent.) A  Christian  put  to  a  cruel  death for  his  Faith  at  Ancyra  in  Galatia  (Asia  Minor), in  the  persecution  under  the  Emperor  Aurelian (A.D.  275). PHILONILLA  (St.)  (Oct.  11)

PHILOTERUS  (St.)  M.  (May  19)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  of  noble  birth,  one 
of the victims at Nicomedia (the  Imperial 
Residence)  of  the  fury  of  the  Emperor  Diocletian 
against the Christians (A.D. 303). But the 
particulars given in the Greek Acts of St.  

Philoterus  are  of  much  later  date,  and  are  now 
regarded  as  unreliable.

See  SS.  HERODION,  ASYNCRITUS, &c. PHOCAS  (St.)  M.  (March  5)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Syrian  Saint  of  one  of the  early  centuries.  His  little  story  is  inter

esting. He  had  given  shelter  for  the  night  to certain  strangers  who  did  not  know  where  to look  for  a  bed.  They,  in  the  course  of  conversation, informed  him  that  their  errand  was  to seek  out  and  arrest  a  certain  Phocas,  who  had been  denounced  as  a  Christian.  Thereupon Phocas  told  them  that  he  himself  was  that  very man,  and  gladly  went  with  them  to  his  trial  and death.  There  was  a  great  devotion  in  the  East to  this  holy  Martyr,  and  he  was  in  particular invoked  by  such  as  had  been  stung  by  venomous 
SIlfclkGS 
PHOCAS(St.)  Bp.,  M.  (July  14)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Sinope  on  the Black  Sea  who  was  put  to  the  torture  and  to death  under  Trajan,  early  in  the  second  century. He  was  famous  for  the  working  of  miracles. In  the  thirteenth  century  his  relics  were  translated to  Vienne  in  France. PHCEBE  (St.)  (Sept.  3)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Christian  matron,  zealous  in  all good  works.  She  was  a  deaconess  of  Cenchrese, near  Corinth,  highly  commended  by  St.  Paul, and  bearer  to  Rome  of  his  Epistle  to  that  Church (Rom.  xvi.  1,  3).  St.  John  Chrysostom  has written  a  sermon  extolling  the  merits  of  St. Phoebe. PHOTIDES  (St.)  M.  (March  20)  

See  SS.  PHOTINA,  JOSEPH, &c.  

PHOTINA,  JOSEPH, VICTOR, SEBASTIAN, 
ANATOLIUS,  PHOTIUS,  PHOTIDES, 
PARASCEVES  and  CYRIACA  (SS.)  

MM.  (March  10)  
(1st cent.)  Christians of the Age of the 
Apostles. Photina,  Photides,  Parasceves  and 
Cyriaca  were  sisters,  and  St.  Victor,  an  officer 
in  the  Imperial  army,  appears  to  have  been 
their  brother.  The  others  were,  it  would  seem, 
soldiers  under  St.  Victor.  Tradition  connects 
them  all  with  Palestine. Indeed,  the  Greeks 
go  so  far  as  to  identify  St.  Photina  with  the 
Samaritan  woman  of the fourth  chapter  of 
St.  John.  The  names  given  above  are,  as  is 
evident,  those  which  these  Christians  took  at 
their  conversion  to  Christianity  and  Baptism.  

That  they  were  put  to  death  on  account  of 
their  religion  is  certain,  but  the  Greek  writers 
need  not  be  followed  in  the  description  they 
give  of  the  preliminary  torments  the Saints 
underwent.  In  the  ordinary  course  they  would 
have  been  scourged  and  then  either  beheaded 
or  burned  alive.  

PHOTINUS,  SANCTIUS,  VETIUS,  EPAGATHUS, 
MATURUS, PONTICUS, BIBLIDES, ATTA
LUS,  BLANDINA  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  

MM.  (June  2)  
(2nd  cent.) These  are  the  famous  Martyrs 
of  Lyons,  of  which  city  Photinus  or  Pothinus 
was  Bishop.  At  the  time  of  his  martyrdom 
the  venerable  Prelate  was  ninety  years  of  age.  

They suffered under the Emperor Marcus 
Aurelius, the Philosopher (a.d. 177).  The 
details  are  given  in  the  authentic  letter  addressed 
on  the  occasion  by  the  Churches  of  Gaul  to  those 
of Asia.  This letter, which is extant, was 
probably composed by St. Irenaeus. The 
Christians  were  at  first  set  upon  by  the  Pagan 
mob ;  but afterwards they were tried and 
condemned,  because  of  their  religion,  by  the 
regular  tribunals.  The  aged  Bishop  Pothinus 
expired  in  his  dungeon  from  the  ill-usage  he 
had received.  The others were thrown, as 
part  of  the  spectacle,  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the 
Amphitheatre  at  the  Public  Games.  The  poor 
slave,  Blandina,  enmeshed  in  a  net  and  tossed 
by  a  wild  bull,  and  the  boy,  Ponticus,  who  was 
one  of  the  last  to  suffer,  have  ever  excited 
special sympathy.  The whole description is 
most  lifelike  ; and  a  particular  touch  of  reality 
is  felt  in  the  paragraph  in  which  the  Christians 
deplore  the  falling  away  of  some  of  their  number, 
and  tell  how  they  tremble  at  the  thought  of 
what  may  be  in  store  for  themselves.

(3rd  cent.)  A  native  of  Italy,  of  Patrician descent,  who  was  sent  into  Gaul  as  a  missionary by  Pope  St.  Fabian.  He  is  venerated  as  the Apostle  of  Chartres  and  of  Tournai.  Towards the  end  of  the  third  century,  after  bravely enduring  imprisonment  and  torture,  he  gave his  life  for  Christ  at  Tournai,  under  the  Emperors Diocletian  and  Maximian  Herculeus.  His  relics are  now  venerated  at  Chartres,  whither  they were  translated  in  the  ninth  century. PIENTIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  11)  

See  SS.  NICASIUS,  QUIRLNUS,  Ac. PIERIUS  (St.)  (Nov.  4)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Alexandria  in  Egypt, a  learned  and  religious  man,  and  the  writer  of several  philosophical  and  theological  treatises. He  lived  during  the  latter  part  of  his  life  in  Rome. Both  St.  Jerome  and  Eusebius  speak  in  the highest  terms  of  his  erudition  and  worth.  He seems  to  have  survived  until  after  a.d.  312, date  of  the  Peace  of  the  Church. *PIERSON  (WALTER)  (BI.)  M.  (May  4)

See  SS.  MELANIA  and  PINIANUS. *PINNOCK  (St.)  (Nov.  6)  

A  church  in  Cornwall  is  called  St.  Pinnocks, but  it  is  probable  that  Pinnock  is  substituted in  error  for  Winnoc. PINYTUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  10)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Greek  Bishop  in  Crete  numbered among  distinguished  Ecclesiastical  writers by  Eusebius.  That  historian  enlarges  on  the devotedness  with  which  St.  Pinytus  ministered to  his  flock.  The  Saint  passed  away  some years  after  a.d.  180. PIONIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  1)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  priest  of  Smyrna  who,  with fifteen  other  Christians,  died  for  the  Faith  in the  persecution  under  the  Emperor  Decius (A.D.  250).  They  were  burned  at  the  stake after  having  previously  been  put  to  the  torture in  its  most  aggravated  form. *PIOR  (St.)  Hermit.  (June  17)  
(4th cent.)  A disciple of St. Antony in Egypt,  and  one  of  the  Fathers  of  the  Desert venerated  in  the  East. *PIRAN  (PYRAN)  (St.)  (March  5)  
(5th  or  6th  cent.)  A  Saint  who  lived  as  a hermit  near  Padstowe  in  Cornwall,  and  who  is regarded  as  the  Patron  Saint  of  miners.  It is  impossible  to  disentangle  the  St.  Piran  legend from  the  history  of  St.  Kyran  Hen  of  Ossory. Many  moderns  insist  on  the  identity  of  the  two Saints.  The  two  names  and  dates  of  Festival days  are  indeed  identical,  but  the  little  we know  of  St.  Piran  of  Cornwall  cannot  be  fitted into  the  life  story  of  St.  Kyran.  The  latter belongs  to  a  much  earlier  period  of  Church history.  Still  less  likely  is  it  that  St.  Piran  is one  and  the  same  with  St.  Kieran  of  Clonmacnoise  (Sept.  9). PIRMINIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  3)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Meaux  in  France. Under  Pope  St.  Gregory  II  he  effected  much for  the  reform  of  Church  discipline  in  France and  Germany.  He  died  about  a.d.  724,  having spent  his  last  years  in  a  monastery  to  which  he had  retired  to  give  himself  up  to  prayer  and penance. PISTIS  (FAITH)  (St.)  V.M.  (Aug.  1)

PIUS  V  (St.)  Pope.  (May  5)  
(16th  cent.)  Michael  Ghislieri,  of  the  noble Bolognese  family  of  that  name,  was  born  in Piedmont  (a.d.  1504).  At  the  age  of  fourteen he  entered  the  Dominican  Order,  and,  when ordained  priest,  acquired  distinction  as  a preacher.  He  became  successively  Bishop  and Cardinal,  and  at  the  death  of  Pius  IV  (a.d.  1559), succeeded  him  as  Pius  V.  He  reformed  many abuses  and  strenuously  insisted  on  the  observance of  the  Decrees  of  the  great  Council  of  Trent, then  just  terminated.  To  his  endeavours  and prayers  is  due  the  great  naval  victory  of  Lepanto (a.d.  1571),  by  which  the  Turkish  menace  to Christendom  was  definitely  checked.  St.  Pius V  died  a.d.  1572.  His  shrine  is  in  St.  Mary Major's  in  Rome.  

PIUS  I  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (July  11)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  successor  in  St.  Peter's Chair  of  Pope  St.  Hyginus.  A.D.  167  is  commonly given  as  the  date  of  his  death,  but modern  research  tends  to  the  fixing  of  it  some years  earlier.  His  appears  to  have  been  a busy  Pontificate  in  which  questions  of  Church discipline  were  energetically  dealt  with.  It corresponds  to  a  period  of  respite  from  official persecution  by  the  Pagan  government.  St. Pius,  however,  has  always  been  reputed  a  Martyr, a  title  he  has  merited,  if  not  by  suffering death  at  the  hands  of  the  heathen,  at  least  on account  of  hardships  endured  from  them  which hastened  his  end.  

PLACIDIA  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  11)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Saint  who  flourished  at  Verona in  the  North  of  Italy,  and  who  appears  to  have entered  into  her  eternal  rest  about  a.d.  460. The  particulars  of  her  life  have  been  lost,  but there  seems  to  be  no  ground  for  the  Mediaeval belief  identifying  her  with  Placidia,  daughter of  the  Emperor  Valentinian  III.  

♦PLACIDUS  and  SIGISBERT  (SS.)  (July  10)  
(6th  cent.)  Sigisbert,  an  Irish  Saint,  a  follower of  St.  Columbanus,  settling  in  the  Swiss Canton  of  the  Grisons,  with  the  help  of  Placidus, lord  of  the  district,  founded,  at  the  end  of  the sixth  century,  the  famous  Abbey  of  Dissentis. St.  Placidus  was  put  to  death  by  evildoers, described  as  enemies  of  religion,  about A.d.  600,  and  was  buried  in  the  same  grave with  St.  Sigisbert,  who  did  not  long  survive him.  

PLACIDUS,  EUTYCHIUS,  VICTORINUS,  FLAVIA, DONATUS,  FIRMATUS,  FAUSTUS  and OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  5)  
(6th  cent.)  Martyrs  of  Messina  in  Sicily, venerated  there  from  ancient  times.  According to  the  account  accepted  from  the  fourteenth century  downwards,  St.  Placidus  was  the youthful  disciple  of  St.  Benedict,  mentioned in  the  Dialogues  of  St.  Gregory  the  Great; SS.  Eutychius  and  Victorinus  were  brothers of  St.  Placidus  and  St.  Flavia  was  their  sister. The  rest,  some  thirty  in  number,  were  monks sent  with  St.  Placidus  by  St.  Benedict  to  found a  monastery  in  Sicily.  A  detailed  legend translated  from  the  Greek  tells  how  they  were set  upon  by  "  pirates  "  (Vandals  or  Northmen, probably)  and  barbarously  murdered  (a.d.  541). However,  since  the  seventeenth  century  this story  has  been  severely  criticised.  In  substance, indeed,  it  may  be  reliable  ;  or,  at  least,  it  cannot be  demonstrated  that  the  Sicilian  Martyrs  were not  Benedictine  monks,  as  alleged.  The  alternative view  is  that  they  were  Martyrs  of  one  of the  early  persecutions  whose  Acts  have  been lost,  and  that  the  coincidence  of  the  name "  Placidus "  misled  the  Mediaeval  hagiographers.

PLATO  (St.)  (Oct.  4)  
(9th cent.) A Greek monk, Abbot of a 
monastery  in  Asia  Minor,  and  afterwards  of 
one at Constantinople.  He was a man of 
austere  and  prayerful  life,  but  his  courage  in 
POMPEIUS 

reprimanding  sin  even  in  the  case  of  the  reigning Emperor  has  above  all  made  his  name  venerable. Bravely,  too,  he  ever  upheld  the  rightful  Patriarchs of  Constantinople  against  usurpers intruded  by  the  government  of  the  time.  He had  to  suffer  imprisonment,  followed  by  banishment. He  survived,  however,  to  the  age  of eighty,  and  died  in  his  monastery,  A.D.  813. PLATO  (St.)  M.  (July  22)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  in  great  veneration  in the  Eastern  Church.  He  suffered  (A.D.  306) under  the  Emperor  Galerius  at  Ancyra  in Galatia  (Asia  Minor).  He  was  savagely  tortured before  being  executed.  The  Second Council  of  Nicsea  (a.d.  787)  bears  solemn witness  to  the  numerous  miracles  wrought  at liis  intercession PLATONIDES  anil  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  6) (Date  unknown.)  A  Palestinian  who  suffered martyrdom,  with  two  other  Christians,  at Ascalon.  These  Saints  are  specially  venerated by  the  Syrians.  Nothing  appears  to  be  known in  our  time  about  them,  and  some  take  the name  "  Platonides "  to  be  that  of  a  man, rather  than  of  a  woman  Saint,  as  generally believed. PLAUTILLA  (St.)  Widow.  (May  20)  
(1st  cent.)  According  to  the  accepted anonymous  Life  of  SS.  Nereus,  Achilleus  and Domitilla,  St.  Plautilla  was  the  mother  of  the last-named.  She  is  described  as  a  noble  Roman matron,  converted  to  Christianity  by  the  Apostle St.  Peter.  She  is  said  to  have  passed  away A.D.  67,  the  same  year  in  which  SS.  Peter  and Paul  suffered  martyrdom. PLAUTUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  29)  

See  SS.  EUTYCHIUS,  PLAUTUS, &c. *PLECHELM  (St.)  Bp.  (July  15)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Saxon  Saint,  born  in  the South  of  Scotland,  who,  accompanied  by  SS. Wiro  and  Otger,  evangelised  the  still  heathen provinces  about  the  Lower  Rhine  and  the mouths  of  the  Meuse.  St.  Plechelm  is  said  to have  been  Bishop  of  Ruremonde,  where  he died  and  was  buried  (A.D.  732). *PLEGMUND  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  2)  
(10th  cent.) The  tutor  of  King  Alfred,  at that monarch's request, consecrated Archbishop of  Canterbury  by  Pope  Formosus.  St. Plegmund  died  a.d.  914. *PLUMTREE  (THOMAS)  (Bl.)  M.  (Jan.  4)

PLUTARCHUS,  SERENUS,  HERACLIDES, 
HERON,  SERENUS, RHAIS, POTAMI03NA 
and  MARCELLA  (SS.)  MM.  (June  28)  
(3rd  cent.) Martyrs  of  Alexandria  in  Egypt 
in the persecution under Septimius Severus 
(a.d.  202).  Eusebius  describes  them  as  being 
disciples  of  Origen,  then  at  the  beginning  of  his 
career. They  were  variously  tortured  before 
execution, and most of  them burned alive.  

Among  those  who  thus  perished  the  best  known 
is  St.  Potamioena,  a  maiden  who  was  tied  to  the 
same  stake  and  died  in  the  same  Are  with  her 
mother,  St.  Marcella.  

PODIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  28)  
(10th  cent.) The  sixteenth  Bishop  of 
Florence.  He was a Prelate of wonderful 
prudence  and  piety,  and  he  did  much  during 
his  twelve  years  of  Episcopate  for  the  Glory  of 
God  and  for  the  well-being  of  the  Church  of 
Florence, a.d.  1002  is  given  as  the  date  of  his 
holy  death.  

POEMON  (St.)  (Aug.  27)  
(5th cent.)  One of the Fathers of the 
Egyptian Desert.  He died A.D. 450. The 
Greeks  hold  him  in  high  veneration. His  name 
is  often  written  in  its  Latin  form  "  Pastor," 
He  does  not  seem  to  have  dwelt  all  his  life  in 
the  same  part  of  Egypt. Hence,  perhaps,  the 
theory  of  some  scholars  that  there  were  two 
Saints  Poemon,  of  whom  one  flourished  in  the 
fourth  and  the  other  in  the  fifth  centurv.

(2nd  cent.)  Converted  to  Christianity  by St.  John  the  Evangelist,  about  a.d.  80,  he became  Bishop  of  Smyrna,  and  was  one  of  the most  famous  Martyrs  of  antiquity.  The Circular  Letter  of  the  Church  of  Smyrna  recounting the  details  of  his  death  has  happily been  preserved.  He  was  burned  alive  (a.d. 166)  with  twelve  other  Christians,  under  the Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius.  His  tomb  at Smyrna  is  still  shown.  His  Epistle  to  the Philippians  is  the  only  one  of  his  writings  that remains  to  us  ;  but  he  is  frequently  referred  to by  the  Fathers,  especially  by  St.  Jerome  and  by St.  Irenseus,  the  latter  his  disciple. POLYCARP  (St.)  (Feb.  23)  
(3rd cent.) A Roman priest of whom mention  is  made  in  the  Acts  of  the  Martyrs of  the  end  of  the  third  century,  on  account  of the  zeal  he  displayed  in  making  converts  to Christianity,  and  in  ministering  to  those  of  the Faithful  who  were  imprisoned  or  under  sentence of  death  because  of  their  belief. POLYCARP  and  THEODORE  (SS.)  MM. (Dec.  7) (Date unknown.) Martyrs at Antioch in Syria. So the ancient Registers.  Nothing more  is  now  known  about  them. POLYCHRONIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  17)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Persian  or  Syrian  Martyr  of the  persecution  under  Decius  (a.d.  250).  He is  described  as  a  Bishop  of  Babylon  and  seems to  have  suffered  after  falling  as  a  prisoner  into the  hands  of  the  Roman  Emperor  during  the latter's  expedition  in  the  East. POLYCHRONIUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  6)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest,  probably  of  Constantinople, who  had  attended  at  the  Council  of Nicsea  (a.d.  325).  He  was  put  to  death  by  the Arians  in  the  time  of  the  heretical  Emperor Constantius.  It  is  said  that  he  was  struck down  at  the  Altar  while  saying  Mass,  and  that with  his  blood  were  mixed  the  consecrated contents  of  his  overturned  chalice. POLYEUCTE  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  officer  (probably  of Greek  parentage)  in  Armenia.  He  became  a convert  to  Christianity,  and  on  that  account was  beheaded,  either  under  Decius  (a.d.  250), or  under  Velerian  (a.d.  259).  His  Acts,  as given  by  Metaphrastes,  are  as  touching  as  any in  early  Christian  literature.  The  personages introduced  by  the  French  poet,  Corneille,  into his  tragedy  of  Polyeucte  (Pauline,  the  Martyr's wife,  Nearque,  his  friend,  etc.)  are  historical. POLYEUCTUS,  VICTORIUS  and  DONATUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (May  21)

POMPONIUS 
He  is  described  as  "  a  man  of  wonderful  simplicity and  humility,  who,  after  a  few  peaceful years,  passed  away  to  Christ." 
POMPONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  14)  
(6th  cent.)  He  was  for  twenty-eight  years Bishop  of  Naples,  where  his  shrine  is  in  great veneration.  Pope  St.  John  I,  in  an  Epistle he  wrote  from  his  prison,  commends  St.  Pomponius  for  his  zeal  and  courage  in  confuting  the Arians,  then  under  the  patronage  of  Theodoric, King  of  the  OstroGoths.  Not  much  else  is now  known  of  the  Saint.  

POMPOSA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  19)

(3rd  cent.)  The  successor  of  Pope  St.  Urban I  (a.d.  230),  in  the  reign  of  the  mild  Emperor, Alexander  Sever  us.  After  the  murder  of  the latter  (A.D.  235)  by  the  usurper,  Maximin,  St. Pontianus  was  banished  to  the  Island  of Sardinia,  and  a  few  months  later  succumbed  to the  hardships  he  was  compelled  to  endure.  

PONTIANUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  2) (3rd  cent.)  St.  Pontianus  was  a  Roman Martyr  of  A.D.  259  who  suffered  with  four other  Christians.  He  had  been  baptised  as  a child  and  miraculously  healed  of  a  palsy  by  the priest  St.  Eusebius,  also  commemorated  on Dec.  2.

(3rd  cent.)  A  deacon  of  the  Church  of Carthage.  He  was  the  faithful  attendant  of the  Martyr  St.  Cyprian  in  his  exile  and  at  his trial  and  execution.  St.  Pontius  has  left  us  a graphic  account  of  the  Life  and  Passion  of  his illustrious  master.  He  died  after  a.d.  260.  

PONTIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  This  Roman  Saint,  who  died  for the  Faith  in  the  North  of  Italy  (A.D.  258)  under the  Emperor  Valerian,  must  not  be  confused, as  has  been  done  by  some  writers,  with  St. Pontius  of  Carthage,  the  witness  of  the  martyrdom of  St.  Cyprian.  We  must  be  cautious  also in  giving  credit  to  the  tradition  that  this Italian  Pontius  was  instrumental  in  converting the  Emperor  Philip  to  Christianity.  The conversion  itself  is  far  from  having  been  proved, and  in  the  writings  of  the  subsequent  period more  than  one  Saint  is  made  to  claim  the  distinction of  having  been  the  human  means  by which  it  was  brought  about.  The  relics  of St.  Pontius,  translated  into  Gaul,  have  given its  name  to  the  town  of  Saint-Pons,  in  Languedoc.  

POPPO  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  25)  
(11th  cent.)  A  pious  and  fervent  monk, born  near  Li6ge,  who,  on  account  of  his  virtue, was  placed  successively  at  the  head  of  several monasteries  in  Belgium  and  the  North  of  France. He  had  considerable  influence  with  St.  Henry, Emperor  of  Germany,  and  laboured  successfully to  do  away  with  some  of  the  barbarous  customs of  his  Age.  He  died  at  Marchiennes  (a.d.  1048).  

PORCARIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  12) (8th  cent.)  These  Martyrs,  five  hundred  in 222 

number,  were  the  community  of  the  famous Abbey  of  Lerins  in  the  island  of  that  name,  off the  coast  of  France,  opposite  Cannes  in  the Mediterranean.  Certain  pirates,  called  by contemporaries  "  Saracens,"  but  more  likely to  have  been  Danes  or  Northmen,  landed  on  the island  (a.d.  731)  and  ravaged  it,  putting  all  to fire  and  sword.  St.  Porcarius,  the  Abbot,  had contrived  to  send  away  to  the  mainland  the boys  that  were  being  educated  in  his  Abbey, with  thirty-six  of  the  younger  monks.  Four others  were  carried  away  by  the  pirates.  The rest,  mercilessly  massacred,  have  ever  since been  honoured  as  Martyrs. PORPHYRIUS  and  SELEUCUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  16) (4th  cent.)  Palestinian  Martyrs,  put  to  death at  Csesarea  a.d.  308.  The  historian  Eusebius gives  an  account  of  their  sufferings  when narrating  the  martyrdom  of  St.  Pamphilus,  one of  whose  dependents  was  St.  Porphyrius.  Both he  and  St.  Seleucus  were  burned  to  death  at  the

(5th  cent.)  A  Greek,  a  personage  of  wealth and  consideration  who,  selling  his  goods  and bestowing  the  proceeds  on  the  poor,  lived  the life  of  a  hermit,  at  first  in  Egypt,  but  afterwards in  Palestine  on  the  banks  of  the  Jordan. Much  against  his  will  he  was  made  Bishop  of Gaza,  and  presided  over  that  Church  for  twentyseven  years.  He  worked  hard  and  successfully at  the  conversion  of  the  Pagans,  in  his  time  still numerous  in  Syria  and  Palestine,  a.d.  420  is given  as  the  date  of  his  death.  Mark,  a  disciple of  St.  Porphyrius,  has  left  us  an  interesting  and trustworthy  life  of  his  master.  

PORPHYRIUS  (St.)  M.  (May  4)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  priest  who  preached  to  the Pagans  in  Umbria  (Central  Italy),  and  who baptised  the  better  known  Martyr  St.  Venantius. He  was  seized  and  beheaded  (a.d.  250)  in  the persecution  under  the  Emperor  Decius.  

PORPHYRIUS  (St.)  (Aug.  20)  
(Date  unknown.)  Beyond  the  name  registered as  above  and  the  assertion  added  that through  him  St.  Agapitus  the  Martyr  became a  Christian,  we  have  no  record  of  this  Saint. The  learned  go  so  far  as  to  suspect  that  the insertion  is  a  mistake,  and  that  this  St.  Porphyrius is  identical  with  his  namesake  of Camerino  in  Umbria,  St.  Agapitus  having  also been  mistakenly  written  for  St.  "Venantius.

See  SS.  ONESIPHORUS  and  PORPHYRIUS.  

PORPHYRIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  15)  
(4th  cent.)  Of  this  Saint  the  same  story  is told  as  of  St.  Genesius.  He  was  an  actor  and, while  mimicking  the  ceremonies  of  Christian Baptism,  suddenly  felt  the  grace  of  God,  and publicly  declared  himself  a  believer.  He  was playing  before  the  Emperor  Julian  the  Apostate, and  paid  for  his  conversion  with  his  life  (a.d. 362).  

PORPHYRIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  4)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Martyr  at  Ephesus  in  Asia Minor  (a.d.  171),  under  the  Emperor  Aurelian. We  have  no  details.  

PORTIANUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  22)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Abbot  in  Auvergne,  famous for  his  miracles  and  for  the  courage  with  which he  faced  the  Merovingian  King  Thierry  of Austrasia,  who  was  ravaging  the  country,  and obtained  from  him  the  release  of  those  of the  inhabitants  he  was  carrying  away  into slavery.  St.  Portianus  died  about  a.d.  540.  

POSSIDIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  16)  
(5th  cent.)  An  African  by  birth,  a  disciple of  St.  Augustine  of  Hippo  and  writer  of  the Life  of  that  Saint.  In  contemporary  literature St.  Possidius  is  frequently  mentioned,  and  he played  a  useful  part  in  the  controversies  of  his time.  He  was  driven  by  the  Vandals  from  the city  in  Africa  in  which  he  was  Bishop,  and ended  his  days  (A.D.  450)  in  Apulia  in  the South  of  Italy.

♦POTAMI(ENA  (St.)  V.M.  (June  7)  
(4th cent.) A young girl, a Christian in 
Egypt,  put  to  death  as  such  at  Alexandria  in 
the  persecution  under  Diocletian  (  a.d.  304  about).  

POTAMION  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (May  18)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Bishop  who  suffered 
imprisonment  as  a  Christian  under  the  Emperor 
Galerius, and who, after the Peace of the 
Church, assisted at the Council of  Nicsea 
(a.d. 325).  True to the Catholic Faith, he 
shared  with  St.  Athanasius  his  exile.  And  it  is 
St. Athanasius who relates how the Arians 
compassed  the  death  of  the  holy  Martyr,  about 
A.D.  340.

(Date  unknown.) Martyrs  in  the  Island  of 
Cyprus  whose  Acts  have  long  since  been  lost.  

POT ITUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  13)  
(2nd  cent.) A  native  of  the  island  of  Sardinia 
who,  when  a  boy,  was  converted  to  Christianity, 
and  later,  in  his  turn,  succeeded  in  converting 
his  own  father.  It  is  alleged  that  the  Emperor 
Marcus  Aurelius  in  person  conducted  the  trial 
of  St.  Potitus,  accused  of  the  crime  of  professing 
the Christian  religion, or  rather, of  that  of 
rejecting  the  gods  of  Rome.  It  seems  certain 
that  he  was  put  to  the  torture  in  Rome  itself, 
but  his  execution  appears  to  have  taken  place 
in  some  city  of  Southern  Italy  (a.d.  166).

(6th cent.) A Bishop of Rouen (France)  

who,  for  his  courage  in  denouncing  the  crimes 
of  the  notorious  Queen  Fredegonda,  was  sent 
into  banishment  and,  after  his  recall,  put  to 
death  by  her  orders  on  the  steps  of  the  Altar 
in  his  own  church  (A.d.  586).

See  SS.  TRASON,  PONTIANUS,  &c. PRAGMATIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  22)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Autun  (France), a  correspondent  of  St.  Sidonius  Apollinaris. His  signature  is  appended  to  the  Acts  of  a  Council celebrated  a.d.  490.  But  nothing  is  now really  known  of  his  life  and  merits. PRAXEDES  (St.)  V.  (July  21)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  daughter  of  the  Roman Senator,  Pudens,  and  sister  of  St.  Pudentiana. She  was  a  fervent  Christian,  and  rendered  great service  to  religion  in  the  first  half  of  the  second century.  She  devoted  her  great  wealth  to  the relieving  of  the  poor.  An  ancient  and  notable church  in  Rome  perpetuates  her  memory,  and bears  witness  to  the  esteem  of  sanctity  in  which Praxedes  was  held  by  the  early  Christians.

Great  Britain.

PRIMITIVA  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  24)  
(Date  uncertain.) An  early  Christian  Martyr 
who  seems  to  have  suffered  in Rome,  but  of 
whom  we  now  know  nothing,  save  her  name 
registered  in  the  Martyrologies.  

PRIMITIVA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  23)  
(Date  uncertain.)  We  have  no  particulars  of 
this  Saint,  beyond  the  name  as  above  and  the 

note  of  place,  "  Rome."  It  is  not  even  clear that  she  is  not  identical  with  the  St.  Primitiva of  Feb.  24.  Several  ancient  Registers  write  her name  Primitia  ;  others,  Privata.

PRIMUS  and  DONATUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  Two  African  deacons  who  were done  to  death  by  the  Donatist  heretics  while striving  to  defend  an  Altar  which  the  latter were  bent  on  destroying  out  of  hatred  of  the Catholic  worship  (A.D.  362).  St.  Optatus  has left  us  a  vivid  account  of  their  Passion.  

PRIMUS  and  FELICIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (June  9)  
(4th  cent.)  Two  aged  brothers,  Roman citizens,  who  in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian and  Maximian  bravely  confessed  their  Faith in  Christ.  They  were  thrown  to  the  wild beasts  in  the  Amphitheatre,  but  Almighty God  repeated  in  their  behalf  the  miracle  He  had worked  for  Daniel  in  the  lions'  den.  They  were therefore  conducted  outside  the  walls  of  Rome and  there  beheaded.  This  happened  in  one of  the  first  years  of  the  fourth  century.  SS. Primus  and  Felician  have  ever  been  in  great veneration  in  the  Western  Church.  

PRIMUS,  SECUNDARIUS  and  CYRIL  (Oct.  2) (SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  at  Antioch  in Syria  in  one  of  the  early  persecutions.  No particulars  are  now  obtainable.  

PRINCIPIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  25)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Soissons  (France), and  brother  of  St.  Remigius  of  Rheims.  The old  chroniclers  dwell  upon  his  virtues  and sanctity  of  life,  but  we  have  no  details  of  his career.  His  body  was  reverently  interred  by St.  Remigius,  outside  the  walls  of  Soissons, about  a.d.  500.  

♦PRIOR  (St.)  Hermit.  (June  17)  
(4th  cent.) An  Egyptian,  one  of  the  first 
disciples  of  St.  Antony.  He  died  at  the  end 
of  the  fourth  century,  being  then  nearly  one 
hundred  years  old.  

PRISCA  (St.)  V.M.  (Jan.  18)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  maiden,  a  fervent Christian,  put  to  the  torture  and  at  last  beheaded, under  the  Emperor  Claudius  II,  about A.D.  270.  A  church  dedicated  to  St.  Prisca exists  in  Rome,  where  she  is  held  in  very  great veneration.  She  is,  of  course,  other  than  the Priscilla  mentioned  in  Holy  Scripture  (Rom. xvi.  3  ;  Acts  xviii.  2,  26),  though  relics  of  the latter  are  enshrined  in  the  Roman  church  of

(1st  cent.) A  noble  Roman  matron,  mother 
of  the Senator Pudens and  grandmother of 
SS.  Praxedes  and  Pudentiana.  The  tradition 
is  that  she  was  the  hostess  in  Rome  of  St.  Peter 
the  Apostle,  by  whom  she  had  been  converted 
to  Christianity.  She  appears  to  have  survived 
the Apostle. A celebrated church in Rome 
bears  her  name.  She  must  not  be  confused 
with  her  contemporary,  St.  Priscilla,  the  wife 
of  Aquila  (Rom.  xvi.  3).

PRISCUS 
woman  who  suffered  death  for  the  Faith  in Rome  during  the  reign  of  Julian  the  Apostate, about  a.d.  362.  All  the  Western  Martyrologies commemorate  them,  though  we  have  no  longer any  detailed  Acts  of  their  Passion.  

PRISCUS,  MALCHUS  and  ALEXANDER 
(SS.)  MM.  (March  28)  
(3rd  cent.)  Palestinian  Martyrs  under  the Emperor  Valerian  (a.d.  260).  Eusebius  mentions them  by  name  in  his  Ecclesiastical  History. They  were  thrown  to  the  wild  beasts  during  the Public  Games  at  Caesarea.  

PRISCUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  26)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  in  Gaul,  near  Auxerre, in  the  time  of  the  Emperor  Aurelian.  Priscus was  an  officer  in  the  Imperial  army,  and  of  his fellow-sufferers,  who  appear  to  have  been  very numerous,  many  were  soldiers  under  his  command. The  greater  part  of  these  Christians appear  to  have  been  massacred  without  trial. A  formal  sentence  of  death  was,  however,  passed on  St.  Priscus  previous  to  his  execution  (a.d. 271).  

PRISCUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  1)  
(1st  cent.)  This  St.  Priscus  is  always  described as  an  old  disciple  of  Christ,  and  often  as one  of  the  seventy-two  whom  He  sent  forth to  evangelise  (Luke  x.).  Tradition  holds  that he  came  to  Italy  with  St.  Peter  and  that  he suffered  death  for  the  Faith  in  the  reign  of Nero.  The  place  named  is  Capua,  of  which city  St.  Priscus  may  possibly  have  been  the first  Bishop.  

PRISCUS,  CASTRENSIS,  TAMMARUS,  ROSIUS, SECUNDINUS,  HERACLIUS,  ADJUTOR, MARCUS,  AUGUSTUS,  ELPIDIUS,  CANION and  VINDONIUS  (SS.)  (Sept.  1)  
(5th  cent.)  An  African  Bishop,  with  his priests,  driven  into  exile  by  the  Vandals. They  reached  the  South  of  Italy,  where  they were  hospitably  received  and  devoted  themselves to  preaching  and  other  Pastoral  work. Several  of  them  seem  to  have  been  appointed Bishops  of  the  Dioceses  in  which  they  had laboured.  

PRISCUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  20)  
(Date  unknown.)  An  Oriental  Saint,  a zealous  preacher  of  Christianity,  who  was  put to  a  death  of  slow  torture  when  at  length  he fell  into  the  hands  of  the  idolaters.  The  little we  know  of  him  is  taken  from  the  Basilian Menology.  

PRISCUS,  CRESCENS  and  EVAGRIUS  (Oct.  1) (SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  whose  Acts  have been  lost.  They  suffered  somewhere  on  the Danube.  Many  of  the  old  Registers  add  the names  of  other  Confessors,  Christians  who shared  their  fate  at  the  same  time  and  place.  

PRIVATUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  21)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Bishop  in  Gaul,  whose  See  of Gevaudan  is  now  that  of  Mende.  He  was  a man  of  prayer  and  of  very  austere  life.  In  an irruption  of  Barbarians  from  Germany  he  was seized  by  them,  but  was  offered  his  life  on condition  of  his  revealing  the  hiding-place  of his  flock.  On  his  refusal,  he  was  beaten  to death  (A.D.  266).

(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  citizen,  scourged  to death  because  of  his  religion  under  the  Emperor Alexander  Severus,  about  a.d.  223.  

PROBUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  12)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Bishop  of  Verona  in Italy,  successor  of  St.  Senator.  There  is  inextricable confusion  in  the  chronology  of Veronese  history.  For  example,  it  is  quite likely  that  more  than  one  of  the  Bishops  was called  Senator.  To  St.  Probus,  some  assign for  date,  a.d.  236 ;  others,  a.d.  390 ;  others again,  a.d.  579.  Beyond  the  generalities  of his  Panegyrists,  we  know  nothing  of  the  life  of this  Saint. 224 

PROBUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  15)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Rieti  in  Central Italy,  the  touching  scene  at  whose  deathbed  is related  by  St.  Gregory  the  Great  in  the  Fourth Book  of  his  Dialogues,  where  he  bears  witness to  the  sanctity  of  St.  Probus. *PROBUS  and  GRACE  (SS.)  (April  5)  
(Date  unknown.) Cornish  Saints,  by  tradition husband and wife. The  church  at Tressilian, or Probus, is dedicated in their honour. PROBUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  11)  

See  SS.  THARACUS,  PROBUS,  &c.  

PROBUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  10)  
(2nd  cent.) The  sixth  Bishop  of  Ravenna, 
but  by  birth a  Roman.  He died a.d.  175, 
and  his  relics  are  still  venerated  in  Ravenna 
Cathedral.  

PROBUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  13)  

See  SS.  ARCADIUS,  PASCHASIUS, &c. PROCESSUS  and  MARTINIANUS  (July  2)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(1st  cent.)  Two  of  the  warders  of  the  Mamertine  Prison  in  Rome  in  which  SS.  Peter  and Paul  were  confined.  A  miracle,  wrought  by the  two  Apostles,  converted  them  to  Christianity and  they  were  baptised  by  St.  Peter.  They met  with  tranquil  constancy  the  cruel  death to  which  on  that  account  they  were  sentenced, and  have  ever  been  in  great  veneration,  not only  in  Rome,  but  throughout  Christendom. *PROCHORUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  9)  
(1st cent.)  One of the Seven Deacons ordained  by  the  Apostles.  The  tradition  is  that he afterwards became Bishop  of Nicomedia and  suffered  martyrdom  at  Antioch. PROCLUS  and  HILARION  (SS.)  MM.  (July  12) (2nd  cent.) Christians  of  Ancyra  in  Galatia (Asia  Minor),  put  to  the  torture  and  to  death (a.d. 115)  during  the  reign  of  the  Emperor Trajan. PROCLUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  24)  
(5th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  John  Chrysostom,  and,  like  him,  a  Patriarch  of  Constantinople. He  died  a.d.  446,  in  the  thirteenth year  of  his  Episcopate,  endeared  to  his  flock by  his  patience  and  gentleness.  All  the  time left  him  by  his  Pastoral  duties  he  spent  in prayer  and  the  reading  of  spiritual  books. PROCOPIUS  (St.)  (Feb.  27)  

See  SS.  BASIL  and  PROCOPIUS. PROCOPIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  8)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Palestinian  Christian,  a  Lector or  Reader  and  Interpreter  in  the  Church  of Scythopolis.  Arrested  during  the  persecution under  Diocletian,  he  was  brought  to  Caesarea, where  he  boldly  confessed  the  Faith  before  his judges  and  was  sentenced  and  executed  (a.d. 303). PROCULUS,  EPHEBUS  and  APOLLONIUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  Christians  who  had  crossed  over into  Italy  and  were  residing  at  Terni  when  the holy  Bishop  Valentine  was  put  to  death  for  the Faith  under  the  Emperor  Aurelian.  They  had honourably  interred  the  remains  of  St.  Valentine, when  they  themselves  were  arrested, condemned  and  executed  (a.d.  273). PROCULUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  13)  
(4th  cent.) A  Bishop  of  Terni  (Italy)  who suffered  martyrdom  (A.D.  310)  under  Maxentius, the usurper,  vanquished  two years later  by Constant  ine. PROCULUS  (St.)  M.  (June  1)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  held  in  high  veneration at  Bologna,  where  he  laid  down  his  life  for Christ  in  the  persecution  under  the  Emperors Diocletian  and  Maximian  Herculeus  (a.d.  304). We  have  no  authentic  details,  but  modern research  has  fairly  fixed  the  date  and  place  as above. PROCULUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  18)

PROCULUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  4)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Martyr  of  Autun  in Gaul.  No  particulars  relating  to  him  are extant.  It  is  to  be  noted,  however,  that  several of  the  ancient  Registers  describe  him  as  "  Proculus,  a  Bishop." 
PROCULUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Dec.  1)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  in  Central  Italy,  either of  Terni  or  of  Narni.  He  appears  to  have  been a  notable  personage  of  his  time.  He  came  into contact  with  Totila,  King  of  the  Goths,  when  the latter  was  ravaging  Italy,  and  it  is  generally admitted  that  he  met  his  death  at  the  hands of  this  despoiler  of  his  flock.  

PROCULUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  (probably  the  fourth) of  Verona  in  Upper  Italy.  He  suffered  imprisonment and  torture,  and  afterwards  banishment  in the  persecution  under  Diocletian,  but  contrived to  return  to  Verona,  where  he  died  peacefully, early  in  the  fourth  century.  

PROJECTUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  24)  

See  SS.  THYRSUS  and  PROJECTUS.  

PROJECTUS  and  MARINUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  25) (7th  cent.)  Martyrs  in  Auvergne  (France). St.  Projectus,  a  zealous  Bishop,  faithful  to  his duty,  failed  not,  when  needed,  to  admonish even  the  great  ones  of  the  earth,  and  thereby made  powerful  enemies.  Some  of  these  murdered him  (A.D.  674),  together  with  his  friend and  confidant,  Marinus  or  Amarinus,  the  Abbot of  a  monastery  in  the  Diocese  of  St.  Projectus.  

PROSDOCIMUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  7)  
(1st  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Padua  in North  Italy,  sent  thither  by  the  Apostle  St. Peter.  He  converted  a  multitude  of  Pagans to  Christianity,  and  his  memory  has  ever  since remained  in  great  veneration  in  the  North-East of  Italy.  Tradition  has  it  that  he  lived  till near  a.d.  100,  but  the  various  Lives  written of  him  are  not  generally  regarded  as  trustworthy.  

PROSPER  of  AQUITAINE  (St.)  Bp.  (June  25)  
(5th  cent.)  A  native  of  Aquitaine,  a  man  of great  learning  and  piety,  who  attracted  the notice  of  Pope  St.  Leo  the  Great,  and  was  by him  employed  in  the  literary  work  connected with  the  subtle  controversies  then  going  on with  the  Nestorian  and  Eutychian  heretics. His  treatises,  however,  against  Pelagianism, and  his  Chronicle,  are  the  most  noteworthy of  his  writings.  He,  or  as  some  think,  another Saint  of  the  same  name,  became  Bishop  of Reggio  in  Calabria.  St.  Prosper  is  commonly believed  to  have  died  in  a.d.  460.  

PROSPER  (St.)  Bp.  (July  29)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Orleans  (France), who  seems  to  have  been  the  immediate  successor of  St.  Anianus  (a.d.  453).  By  the  writers  of the  next  few  centuries  this  St.  Prosper  has  so often  been  confused  with  his  contemporary, or  contemporaries,  St.  Prosper  of  Aquitaine and  St.  Prosper  of  Reggio,  that  nothing  certain can  be  set  down  concerning  his  life.  

PROTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  19)  

See  SS.  GERVASIUS  and  PROTASIUS.  

PROTASIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  4)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Martyr  honoured  at Cologne.  It  is  not  at  all  certain  that  he  is  other than  the  St.  Protasius  who  was  a  fellow-sufferer with  St.  Gervasius  at  Milan.  Some  relics transported  from  Milan  into  Germany  may have  given  origin  to  the  special  Feast  of Aug.  4,  which  is  wanting  in  the  more  ancient Registers.  

PROTASIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  24)  
(4th  cent.)  Born  at  Milan,  he  was  consecrated Bishop  of  that  city  by  Pope  St.  Sylvester. He  held  the  See  for  about  twenty-five years,  and  passed  away  a.d.  352.  He  assisted at  the  Council  of  Sardica,  where  he  strenuously defended  St.  Athanasius  and  the  Catholic Belief  in  the  Trinity.  

♦PROTERIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Feb.  28)  
(6th cent.)  A  Patriarch of  Alexandria, 

ordained  priest  by  St.  Cyril.  He  replaced  in  the See  of  Alexandria  the  heretic  Dioscurus,  and did  his  utmost  to  combat  the  plots  of  the Eutychians  who  were  leading  his  flock  astray. They,  however,  succeeded  in  murdering  him  on Good  Friday,  A.d.  557.  St.  Proterius  is  greatly venerated  in  the  East.  

PROTOGENES  (St.)  Bp.  (May  6)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Carrhse  in  Syria, who,  together  with  St.  Eulogius  of  Edessa, suffered  banishment  for  the  Faith  in  the  reign of  the  Arian  Emperor  Valens.  In  the  end both  Bishops  were  restored  to  their  flocks. Such  particulars  as  we  have  of  them  are  taken from  the  Ecclesiastical  History  of  Theodoret, who  wrote  in  the  fifth  century.  

PROTOLICUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  14)  

See  SS.  BASSUS,  ANTONIUS,  &c.  

PROTUS  (St.)  (May  31)  

See  SS.  CANTIUS,  CANTIANUS,  &c.  

PROTUS  and  JANUARIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  25) (4th  cent.)  Two  Sardinian  Saints  of  great celebrity  in  their  island.  Ordained  by  Pope St.  Caius,  the  one  to  the  priesthood,  the  other to  the  deaconate,  they  laboured  successfully in  spreading  Christianity.  In  the  persecution under  Diocletian  they  were  put  to  the  torture, and  in  the  end  beheaded  at  Porto  Torres,  not far  from  Sassari  (A.D.  303).  

PROTUS  and  HYACINTH  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  11) (3rd  cent.)  Two  famous  Roman  Martyrs, probably  brothers,  servants  or  dependents  of St.  Eugenia.  The  weight  of  evidence  is  in favour  of  a.d.  262,  in  the  reign  of  the  Emperor Gallienus,  being  the  year  of  their  death,  though some  would  defer  it  for  about  forty  years  and make  SS.  Protus  and  Hyacinth  victims  of  the great  persecution  under  Diocletian.  In  any case,  arrested  as  Christians,  they  were  scourged and  beheaded.  In  the  following  century Pope  St.  Damasus  restored  and  embellished their  shrine,  over  which  verses  written  by  him were  inscribed.  

♦PRUDENTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  6)  
(9th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  learned  prelates of  his  age,  zealous  and  successful  in  confuting the  then  threatening  heresies  of  Gotteschalk, Scotus  Erigena  and  others.  Butler  defends him  well  from  the  charge  of  having  in  certain passages  of  his  works  advanced  erroneous doctrines  in  reference  to  abstruse  points  of theology.  His  name,  however,  is  not  inserted in  the  Roman  Martyrology.  As  Bishop  of Troyes  he  showed  himself  energetic  in  reforming Church  discipline.  He  passed  away  a.d.  861. He  is,  of  course,  quite  other  than  the  Spanish Christian  poet  Prudentius.  

PRUDENTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  28)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Tarragona  in  Spain, in  the  Cathedral  of  which  city  his  relics  are enshrined.  

♦PSALMODIUS  (St.)  (June  14)  
(7th  cent.)  Of  Irish  or  Scottish  descent,  and a  disciple  of  St.  Brendan.  He  passed  into France  and  lived  an  austere  life  as  a  hermit near  Limoges.  He  died  in  the  closing  years  of the  seventh  century.  That  he  is  other  than St.  Saumay  seems  the  most  probable  supposition in  order  to  reconcile  the  various  accounts  given of  St.  Psalmodius,  though  the  lives  coincide  in various  details.  

PSALMODIUS  (SAUMAY)  (St.)  (July  15)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  man  whom  the  traditions of  the  Diocese  of  Limoges  in  France,  where  he passed  his  life,  aver  to  have  been  a  native  of Great  Britain.  He  lived  as  a  hermit  and became  famous  for  his  gifts  of  miracles  and prophecy.  That  he  flourished  in  the  sixth century  can  hardly  be  controverted.  

PTOLEMY  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  24)  
(1st  cent.)  A  disciple  of  the  Apostle  St. Peter,  sent  by  him  to  introduce  Christianity into  Tuscany.  He  suffered  martyrdom  in  the town  of  Nepi,  and  his  relics  are  venerated  in the  Cathedral  there.  

225 

PTOLEMY 
PTOLEMY  and  LUCIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  19)  
(2nd cent.) Roman Martyrs under the 
Emperor  Antoninus  Pius.  St.  Justin  Martyr, 
their contemporary, has left us a detailed 
account  of  their  sufferings.  

PUBLIA  (St.)  (Oct.  9)  
(4th cent.) A Syrian matron, head of a 
community  of  nuns  near  Antioch. While  the 
Emperor  Julian  was  passing  on  his  way  to  his 
disastrous  campaign  against  the  Persians,  she 
is  said  to  have  remonstrated  publicly  with  him 
on  his  apostasy,  and  on  that  account,  by  his 
orders,  to  have  been  grievously  ill-treated. It 
is  alleged  too  that  he  had  intended  to  have  her 
put  to  death  on  his  return,  but his having 
perished  during  the  war  allowed  of  the  holy 
woman's  ending  her  days  in  peace.  

♦PUBLICUS  (St.)  (July  3)  

Otherwise  St.  BIBLIG,  which  see. PUBLIUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Jan.  21)  
(2nd  cent.)  Persistent  tradition  identifies this  Saint  with  the  Publius,  "  chief  man  of  the Island  of  Malta"  (Acts  xxviii.  7),  the  host  of St.  Paul  after  his  shipwreck.  Converted  to Christianity,  he  is  said  to  have  become  Bishop of  Athens,  and  to  have  suffered  martyrdom under  Trajan,  about  a.d.  112.
♦PUBLIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  25)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Saint  in  Mesopotamia,  where he  governed  two  communities  of  monks,  the one  of  Greeks,  the  other  of  Asiatics.  He  was distinguished  for  his  exceeding  austerity  of life. PUBLIUS,  JULIAN,  MARCELLUS  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  19)  
(Date  unknown.)  African  Martyrs,  whose names  are  retained  in  the  Roman  Martyrology  because  registered  in  all  the  ancient catalogues,  but  whose  Acts  have  long  since been  lost. PUBLIUS,  VICTOR,  HERMAS  and  PAPIAS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  2)  
(Date  unknown.) African  Martyrs  of  whom nothing,  save  their  names,  is  now  known. PUDENS  (St.)  (May  19)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  Roman  Senator,  baptised by  the  Apostles,  who  was  the  father  of the  virgins  SS.  Praxedes  and  Pudentiana. He  is  by  many  identified  with  the  Pudens mentioned  in  the  New  Testament  (2  Tim. iv.  21). PUDENTIANA  (St.)  V.  (May  19)  
(2nd  cent.)  Otherwise  called  Potentiana. She  was  the  daughter  of  St.  Pudens,  the  Senator. Together  with  her  sister,  St.  Praxedes,  she helped  greatly  the  Church  in  Rome  during  the first  half  of  the  second  century.  They  buried the  bodies  of  the  Martyrs  and  spent  their wealth  on  the  poor.  St.  Pudentiana's  church, built,  it  is  believed,  on  the  site  of  the  mansion of  St.  Pudens,  is  one  which  attracts  much attention  on  account  of  its  association  with early  Christian  history. PULCHERIA  AUGUSTA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  10)  
(5th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  the  Eastern Emperor  Arcadius.  She  wisely  governed  the countries  subject  to  Constantinople  during  the minority  of  her  brother,  Theodosius  II.  The latter,  on  attaining  his  majority,  fell  away  from the  Catholic  Faith,  and  sadly  mismanaged  the affairs  of  the  Empire.  On  his  death,  Pulcheria, becoming  Empress,  entered  into  a  matrimonial contract  with  Marcion,  an  old  soldier  of  valour and  experience,  altogether  fitted  for  the  task of  aiding  her.  She  survived  only  three  years, passing  away  A.d.  453.  The  Universal  Council of  Chalcedon  salutes  Pulcheria  as  "  Guardian of  the  Faith,  Maker  of  Peace,  pious,  orthodox and  a  second  St.  Helena." PUPULUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  28)

Q 

QUADRAGESIMUS  (St.)  (Oct.  26)  
(6th  cent.) A  Sub-deacon  in  a  church  of Southern  Italy,  commended  for  his  holiness  by St. Gregory the Great.  The learned Pope relates  of  him  that  he  miraculously  restored  a dead  man  to  life. QUADRATUS  (CODRATUS),  THEODOSIUS,  EMMANUEL and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  26) (Date uncertain.) Asiatic Martyrs (fortythree  in  number)  who  were  after  torture  put  to death as  Christians.  St.  Quadratus, their leader,  is  said  to  have  been  a  Bishop,  but  all particulars  are  lacking. QUADRATUS  (St.)  M.  (May  7)  
(3rd cent.)  A Saint in Asia Minor who appears  to  have  languished  for  years  in  prison before  being  put  to  death  as  a  Christian,  towards a.d.  257,  under  Valerian. QUADRATUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  26)  
(2nd  cent.)  Registered  in  the  old  Martyrologies  as  a  disciple  of  the  Apostles  and  successor of  St.  Publius  as  Bishop  of  Athens,  where  he died  some  time  before  a.d.  130.  He  is  famous as  having  written  a  work  in  defence  of  the Christian  religion,  so  convincing  that,  according to  St.  Jerome,  the  reading  it  caused  the  Emperor Hadrian  to  put  a  stop  to  the  persecution  then raging. QUADRATUS  (St.)  M.  (May  26)  
(Date  uncertain.)  An  African  Martyr  on whose  Festival  St.  Augustine  delivered  a discourse  in  his  praise,  of  which  some  fragments are  extant.  He  is  believed  to  have  suffered  in company  with  five  other  Christians.  Nothing more  about  him  is  known. QUADRATUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  21)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Of  this  Saint,  registered in  the  Martyrologies,  nothing  whatever  is known.  It  has  been  conjectured  that  he  is identical  with  the  famous  St.  Quadratus  of Athens  (May  26),  and  that  by  some  mistake or  unknown  reason  his  name  has  been  twice set  down  in  the  records. QUARTILLA  (St.)  M.  (March  19)  

See  SS.  QUINCTILLUS,  QUINTILLA, &c. QUARTUS  and  QUINCTUS  (SS.)  MM. (May  10) (Date  uncertain.) Two  Christian  citizens  of Capua  condemned  and  executed  in  Rome  for their  religion,  whose  remains  were  taken  back to  Capua  and  there  enshrined,  but all particulars have  been  lost. QUARTUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  6)  

See  SS.  XYSTUS,  FELICISSIMUS,  &c. QUARTUS  (St.)  (Nov.  3)  
(1st  cent.)  The  disciple  of  the  Apostles  whom St.  Paul  (Rom.  xvi.  23)  mentions  as  "  greeting the  Christians  of  Rome."  Some  traditions make  of  St.  Quadratus  a  Bishop,  others describe  him  as  one  of  the  seventy-two  missionaries chosen  by  Christ,  but  we  know nothing  certain  about  him. QUARTUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  18)  

See  SS.  VICTURUS,  VICTOR, &c. QUENTIN  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  31)  

Otherwise  St.  QUINCTINUS,  which  see. QUERANUS  (St.)  (Sept.  9)  

Otherwise  St.  PYRAN,  KIERAN,  KERRIER,  which  see.  QUIRINUS  may  be  taken as  one  of  the  Latinised  forms  of  the  names  of both  St.  Kieran  of  Ossory  and  of  St.  Kyran  of Saghir.  Another  ivould  be  QUERANUS,  as above. QUINCTIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (June  14)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Saint  described  by  the Roman  Martyrology  as  Bishop  of  Rodez  (South of  France) ;  but  it  would  seem  by  mistake, as  the  St.  Quinctian  of  Rodez  became  Bishop of  Auvergne,  and  is  venerated  on  Nov.  13. The  St.  Quinctian  of  June  14  is  now  judged by  the  learned  to  have  been  not  a  Bishop, but  a  simple  priest. 
QUIRINUS 

QUINCTIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  13)  
(6th  cent.)  An  African  by  birth,  an  account of  whose  holy  life  we  have  from  the  pen  of St.  Gregory  of  Tours.  He  appears  to  have been  among  the  Catholics  who,  when  the African  Church  was  persecuted  by  the  Vandals, took  refuge  in  Gaul.  He  was  appointed  Bishop of  Rodez  in  the  South  of  France,  but  driven thence  by  the  Goths,  at  that  time  in  possession of  the  country.  He  retired  into  Auvergne, where  St.  Euphrasius  made  him  his  successor in  the  See  of  Clermont-Ferrand.  His  sanctity was  witnessed  to  by  many  miracles,  a.d.  527 is  given  by  some  as  the  date  of  his  death. QUINCTIANUS  and  IREN/EUS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  1)  
(Date  uncertain.) Armenian  Martyrs  venerated both  by  the  Greeks  and  by  the  Latins, but  concerning  whom  no  reliable  particulars are  extant. QUINCTIANUS,  LUCIUS  and  JULIAN (May  23)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  group  of  African Martyrs.  There  appear  to  have  been  sixteen, besides  the  three  named,  and  among  them several  women.  The  Roman  Martyrology marks  them  as  having  suffered  under  the  Arian King  Hunneric,  that  is,  in  the  fifth  century, but  modern  scholars  insist  that  the  date  remains conjectural. QUINCTIANUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  30)  

See  SS.  STEPHEN,  PONTIANUS, &c. QUINCTILIS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (March  8)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Martyr  of  Nicomedia (Asia  Minor).  Most  of  the  ancient  records  add as  a  fellow-sufferer  with  St.  Quinctilis  (variously written  Quintillus,  Quintolinus,  <fec.)  a  St. Capitolinus. QUINCTILLIAN  (St.)  M.  (April  13)  

See  SS.  MAXIMUS,  QUINCTILLIAN, &c. QUINCTINUS  (QUENTIN)  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  31)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  of  noble  family  who accompanied  St.  Lucian  as  a  missionary  to Gaul.  St.  Lucian  worked  from  Beauvais, St.  Quentin  from  Amiens.  Rictiovarus,  Prefect of  Gaul,  under  Diocletian  and  Maximian, caused  the  latter  Saint  to  be  seized  and  beheaded at  the  place  now  called  Saint-Quentin,  after  him. His  body  was  thrown  into  the  Somme  (a.d. 290),  whence  the  Christians  afterwards  recovered and  reverently  interred  it. QUINCTIUS,  ARCONTIUS  and  DONATUS  (Sept.  5)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.) Martyrs  venerated  at 
Capua  and elsewhere  in  the  South  of Italy, 
but  of  whom  no  particulars  have  reached  our 
time.  

♦QUINCTIUS  (QUENTIN)  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  4)  
(6th  cent.)  A  citizen  of  Tours,  an  Official at  the  Court  of  King  Clotaire  I.  He  forfeited his  life  rather  than  yield  to  a  temptation similar  to  that  which  Holy  Scripture  narrates to  have  assailed  the  Patriarch  Joseph  in  Egypt. QUINCTUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  4)  

See  SS.  AQUILINUS,  GEMINUS,  &c. QUINCTUS,  QUINCTILLA,  QUARTILLA,  MARK 
and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  19)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Martyrs  venerated  at Sorrento,  near  Naples.  The  three  first-named were  probably  a  brother  with  his  two  sisters. It  is  stated  that  with  them  suffered  ten  other Christians,  but  no  particulars  are  obtainable. QUINCTUS  (St.)  M.  (May  10)

See  SS.  HYACINTH,  QUINCTUS,  &c. QUINCTUS,  SIMPLICIUS  and  OTHERS (Dec.  18)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  in  Africa  under  the Emperors  Decius  and  Valerian  (a.d.  250260).  It  may  be  that  the  Epistle  of  St.  Cyprian to  Quinctus  is  addressed  to  this  Martyr,  who was  his  contemporary,  and  was  put  to  death at  about  the  same  time  with  him. QUINIDIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  15)  
(6th  cent.)  A  French  Saint  who,  after  some years  of  hermit  life  at  Aix  in  Provence,  was 

elected  Bishop  of  Vaison.  He  was  present  at the  Synods  of  Aries  (a.d.  552)  and  of  Paris (A.D.  572).  Several  remarkable  miracles  are recorded  as  having  taken  place  in  answer  to his  prayers.  He  died  A.D.  579  or  thereabouts.

QUIRIACUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  12)  

See  SS.  HILARIA,  DIGNA, &c.  

QUIRIACUS,  MAXIMUS,  ARCHELAUS  and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  23)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Quiriacus  is  stated  to  have been  Bishop  of  Ostia  at  the  mouth  of  the  Tiber  ; SS.  Maximus  and  Archelaus,  priest  and  deacon respectively.  They,  with  a  number  of  Christian soldiers,  appear  to  have  suffered  about  the same  time  as  the  better  known  St.  Hippolytus (Aug.  22).  The  Roman  Martyrology  notes  the martyrdom  of  St.  Quiriacus  and  his  fellowsufferers  as  having  taken  place  during  the reign  of  Alexander  Severus  (a.d.  222-235), but  the  moderns  tend  to  place  it  twenty  or  more years  later.  

QUIRIACUS  (St.)  Hermit.  (Sept.  29)  
(6th  cent.)  He  was  a  Greek  by  birth,  but travelled  to  Palestine  and  there  embraced  the monastic  life.  He  lived  in  various  monasteries and  hermitages  until,  it  is  said,  he  had  long passed  his  hundredth  year,  dying  some  time before  a.d.  550.  He  had  great  influence  in  his time,  and  is  praised  for  having  always  without hesitation  defended  the  pure  Catholic  doctrine in  the  subtle  disputes  which  troubled  the Eastern  Church.  

QUIRICUS  (CYR)  and  JULITTA  (SS.) (June  16) MM.  

(4th  cent.)  We  have  the  touching  Acts  of the  Martyrdom  of  these  Saints.  The  record  is undeniably  authentic  and  original.  Julitta,  a lady  of  Iconium  in  Asia  Minor,  was  arrested during  the  persecution  under  Diocletian  and accused  of  being  a  Christian.  She  appeared in  Court,  carrying  her  three-year-old  child (St.  Cyr)  in  her  arms.  Before  being  beheaded she  was  cruelly  compelled  to  witness  the  dashing out  of  the  brains  of  her  little  son  (a.d.  304). She  died  bravely,  thanking  God  that  her  child could  never  more  be  taken  away  from  her. Both  mother  and  son  are  to  this  day  venerated in  the  East  and  in  the  West.  Even  the  Abyssinians  keep  a  Feast  Day  in  their  honour.  

QUIRINUS  (St.)  M.  (March  25)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  Martyr  who  suffered under  the  Emperor  Claudius  II.  (a.d.  269). Mention  of  him  is  made  in  the  Acts  of  St. Valentine,  Martyr.  Further  particulars  are wanting.  f" 
QUIRINUS  (St.)  M.  (March  30)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Roman  Official  who  was  in charge  of  the  prison  in  which  Pope  St.  Alexander was  confined.  The  holy  Pontiff  succeeded  in converting  to  Christianity  Quirinus,  with  his whole  household.  Shortly  afterwards,  Quirinus was  arrested,  put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded (a.d.  117),  under  the  Emperor  Hadrian.  

QUIRINUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  4)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Martyr  at  Tivoli  near Rome,  concerning  whom  no  particulars  are  now discoverable.  

QUIRINUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (June  4)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Ulyrian  who  became  Bishop of  a  town  in  Hungary  now  called  Seseg.  He died  for  the  Faith  after  enduring  many  tortures, in  one  of  the  last  years  of  the  persecution  under Diocletian  (a.d.  310  about).  When  many years  later  the  inhabitants  of  Seseg  had  to forsake  their  homes,  on  account  of  the  invasion of  the  Barbarians,  and  came  as  refugees  in considerable  numbers  to  Rome,  they  brought

with  them  the  relics  of  their  Bishop-Martyr, St.  Quirinus.  The  relics  are  still  enshrined  in one  of  the  Roman  churches.

See  SS.  NICASIUS,  QUIRINUS,  &c.  

QUITERIA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  22)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Spanish  Saint  concerning whom  we  have  unfortunately  no  facts which  we  can  assert  for  certain.  Several  cities in  Spain  and  in  Southern  France  put  forward pretensions  to  the  possession  of  her  relics. Some  writers  date  her  martyrdom  in  the  fifth century.  The  most  we  can  say  is  that  there certainly  flourished  a  St.  Quiteria  in  an  early century  on  the  borders  of  France  and  Spain, and  that,  if  in  time  of  persecution  she  in  any way  attracted  attention,  it  is  highly  probable that  she  ended  her  life  by  martyrdom.

QUODVULTDEUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  26)  
(5th  cent.)  An  African  Saint,  a  Bishop  of Carthage.  When  the  Arian  Genseric,  King  of the  Vandals,  captured  Carthage  (A.D.  439) he  put  Bishop  and  clergy  on  board  ship  and drove  them  away,  destitute  of  everything. They  landed  at  Naples,  employed  themselves to  the  best  of  their  ability  in  ministering  to  the spiritual  needs  of  the  population,  and  so impressed  all  who  witnessed  their  patient endurance  of  adversity  that  after  they  had passed  away  they  were  universally  acclaimed as  Saints.

♦RABANUS  (RHABANUS),  MAURUS  (Feb.  4)  
(Bl.)  Bp.  

(9th  cent.)  An  Archbishop  of  Mainz,  and  one of  the  most  erudite  men  of  his  century.  His life,  both  as  monk  and  Abbot  of  Fulda,  and afterwards  as  the  most  prominent  Prelate  in Germany,  was  such  as  to  attract  to  him  the homage  and  veneration  of  all.  He  died  a.d. 856,  leaving  us  valuable  Commentaries  on  the Scriptures  and  other  learned  works,  the  composition of  which  argues  undeniable  talent  and perseverance  in  view  of  the  semi-civilised surroundings  in  which  he  lived. *RADBOD  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  29)  
(10th cent.) An Archbishop of Utrecht, famous  for  piety  and  learning  as  well  as  for pastoral  zeal.  He  died  at  Deventer,  a.d.  918. *RADEGUND  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  13)  
(13th  cent.)  A  poor  servant  girl  of  Augsburg (Germany),  pious  and  charitable  to  all  to  a degree  that  awakened  the  astonishment  of  all. In  her  intervals  from  work  she  busied  herself in  ministering  to  the  lepers  and  outcasts  in  the country  lanes.  While  engaged  on  one  occasion in  this  holy  service,  she  met  with  her  death, being  attacked  and  torn  to  pieces  by  wolves. RADEGUND  (St.)  Widow.  (Aug.  13)  
(6th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  a  Pagan  King or  chieftain  ruling  in  Thuringia,  whose  assassination was  avenged  by  Clotaire  I,  King  of  Soissons. The  latter  had  the  child,  then  twelve  years  old, baptised  and  educated.  Eventually  he  married her  ;  but  much  ill-usage,  crowned  by  the  King's murder  of  her  brother  and  seizure  of  his  domnions,  compelled  Radegund  to  leave  him.  After some  hesitation,  she  was  allowed  to  embrace the  Religious  Life,  and  founded  the  monastery of  Holy  Cross  at  Poitiers.  Here  she  passed away,  a.d.  587,  venerated  in  life  and  after  death as  a  Saint. *RADINGUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  17)

RAINERIUS  (St.)  (June  17)  
(12th  cent.)  Born  of  noble  parents  at  Pisa (A.D.  1128),  Rainerius  (Ranieri),  soon  after attaining  the  age  of  manhood,  gave  himself up  to  a  life  of  prayer,  penance  and  good  works. Especially,  after  his  return  from  a  pilgrimage to  the  Holy  Land,  his  advice,  as  a  spiritual director,  was  sought  by  his  fellow-citizens  of all  ranks.  By  his  prayers  he  worked  many miracles.  He  retired  eventually  to  a  monastery near  Pisa,  where  he  died  a.d.  1160.  

RAINERIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  30)

♦RALPH  (RADULPHUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (June  21)  
(9th  cent.)  A  monk  of  the  Royal  Blood  of France  who  became  Archbishop  of  Bourges and  who  was  indefatigable  in  his  Pastoral  work. He  was  also  a  learned  man,  and  some  of  his writings  are  yet  extant  and  useful.  He  died A.D.  866.  

♦RALPH  SHERWIN  (Bl.)  M.  (Dec.  1)  
(16th  cent.)  A  native  of  Derbyshire  who gained  a  Fellowship  at  Oxford  and  was  an excellent  classical  scholar.  After  his  conversion to  the  Catholic  Religion  he  gave  up  all  his prospects,  and  in  due  time  received  the  priesthood. He  made  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome,  and on  his  return  to  England  was  arrested.  Queen Elizabeth  offered  him  high  preferment  if  he would  turn  Protestant ;  but,  on  his  indignant refusal,  had  him  put  to  death  (a.d.  1581)  at the  same  time  as  Bl.  Edmund  Campion,  whose blood,  which  stained  the  hangman's  hand, Bl.  Ralph  reverently  kissed  before  laying  down his  own  life.  

♦RAMIRUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  13)  
(7th  cent.) Benedictine  monks  of  the 
monastery  of  Leon  in  Spain,  massacred  by  the

(7th cent.) The father of St. Hainulph, 
Abbot  of  Arras,  near  which  city  St.  Ranulph 
is  stated  to  have  lost  his  life  for  the  Faith, 
about  A.D.  700.  

♦RAPHAEL  THE  ARCHANGEL  (St.)  (Oct.  24) One  of  the  three  Angels  venerated  by  name in  the  Church.  St.  Raphael  (Tob.  xii.  15)  is "  One  of  the  Seven  who  stand  before  the  Lord." The  Book  of  Tobias  consists  of  the  relation  of one  of  his  beneficent  ministrations  to  men. Many  churches  are  dedicated  to  him,  and  his Feast  is  celebrated  very  generally  throughout the  Church.  

RASYPHUS  (St.)  M.  (July  23)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Martyr  venerated  from early  ages  in  Rome,  but  of  whom  nothing whatever  is  now  known.  He  is  possibly identical  with  a  St.  Rasius  whose  relics  are enshrined  in  the  Pantheon  in  Rome.  

♦RAVENNUS  and  RASYPHUS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  23) (5th  cent.)  Natives  of  Great  Britain  who took  refuge  in  Normandy  about  the  middle  of the  fifth  century  from  the  Anglo-Saxon  invaders of  their  country.  They  lived  there  as  hermits until  put  to  death  by  order  of  the  Governor (or  subordinate  magistrate)  of  Neustria,  who appears  to  have  been  still  a  Pagan.  The shrine  of  the  Saints  is  in  Baveux  Cathedral.  

RAYMUND  of  PENNAFORT  (St.)  (Jan.  23)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Spaniard  of  noble  birth  who 
in  middle life  entered  the Dominican  Order 
and  eventually  became  General  of  the  same.  

He  co-operated  with  St.  Peter  Nolasco  in  the 
RESTITUTA 

Foundation  of  the  Order  of  Our  Lady  of Ransom  for  the  Redemption  of  Captives.  He was  remarkable  as  a  zealous  and  eloquent preacher,  austere  in  his  own  life,  but  considerate and  kindly  with  others.  He  was  in great  esteem  at  the  Pontifical  Court  and  the chief  adviser  of  Pope  Gregory  IX.  He  was  one of  the  most  learned  men  of  his  time,  and  his Collection  of  Canons  known  as  the  "  Decretals  " remained  the  authoritative  text-book  of  Church Law  until  the  promulgation  of  the  new  "Codex  ' ' in  1917.  St.  Raymund  died,  a  centenarian, a.d.  1275.  

♦RAYMUND  of  FITERA  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  1) (12th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Cistercian  monk, founder  and  organiser  of  the  famous  Military Order  of  Calatrava.  The  object  of  its  members was  the  recovery  of  Spain  from  the  Moors,  and originally  they  were  Oblates  of  the  Cistercian Order.  St.  Raymund  died  A.D.  1163,  and  soon afterwards  his  Military  Order  became  secularised.  

RAYMUND  NONNATUS  (St.)  (Aug.  31)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Saint,  Religious  of the  then  newly-founded  Order  of  Our  Lady  of Ransom.  He  spent  his  all  in  the  Moorish countries  of  North  Africa  in  the  purchase  back of  Christian  slaves,  and,  in  the  end,  gave himself  as  a  hostage  to  secure  the  liberty  of one  of  their  number.  He  thenceforth  lived in  slavery  and  endured  terrible  hardships  until his  Order  succeeded  in  ransoming  him  in  his turn.  Returning  to  Europe,  he  was  received with  the  utmost  veneration  and  was  even raised  to  the  Cardinalate  by  Pope  Gregory  IX. Nevertheless,  he  persisted  in  living  as  a  humble Religious  until  his  holy  death  (A.D.  1240).

a  friend  of  St.  Gregory  the  Great,  who  bears 
witness  to  his  sanctity.  He  died  about  a.d.  586.

See  CARTHUSIAN  MARTYRS.  

♦REGINA  (REGNIA,  REINE)  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  7) (3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden,  put  to  death on  account  of  her  religion  at  Autun  (France), most  probably  in  the  Decian  persecution  (a.d. 250).  Some  authors,  however,  number  her among  the  victims  of  the  Emperor  Maximian HerciUeus,  and  give  a.d.  286  as  the  date  of  her death.  

♦REGULA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  11)  

See  SS.  FELIX  and  REGULA.  

REGULUS  (RIEUL)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  30)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Greek,  the  first  Bishop of  Senlis  (North  of  France),  also  at  one  time venerated  by  the  people  of  Aries  (near  Marseilles) as  one  of  their  Bishops.  The  old  belief was  that  St.  Rieul  was  sent  as  a  missionary  to Gaul  by  the  Apostles  in  the  first  century. But  many  moderns  post-date  him  to  the  middle of  the  third  century.  In  either  case,  there  can be  no  doubt  that  he  was  a  singularly  holy  and succpssful  missionary  Bishop.  His  shrine  was at  Senlis,  where  he  died.  

♦REGULUS  (RULE)  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  30)  
(4th  cent.)  According  to  Scottish  tradition, St.  Rule  was  a  holy  man  to  whom  in  the  Dime of  the  Emperor  Constantine  it  was  by  Divine direction  committed  to  carry  away  to  the  ends of  the  earth  a  portion  of  the  relics  of  St.  Andrew, the  Apostle.  Hence,  coming  to  Pagan  Scotland, he  enshrined  them  in  the  place  since  called St.  Andrews,  and  there  presided  until  his  death over  a  community  of  fervent  Christians.  Other and  more  likely  accounts  of  the  Translation of  the  Relics  of  St.  Andrew  to  Scotland  put  it at  a  much  later  date,  and  connect  it  with  the name  of  the  Scottish  King  Constantine,  about the  middle  of  the  fifth  century. 

REGULUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  1)  
(6th  cent.)  An  African  (probably  a  Bishop) driven  into  exile  by  the  Arian  Vandals.  He landed  in  Tuscany,  in  company  with  St.  Cerbonius  and  others,  and  appears  to  have  suffered martyrdom  when  the  Barbarian  Totila  was ravaging  Italv  (about  a.d.  545).

His  memory  is  still  in  great  local  veneration.  

REMBERT  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  4)  
(9th  cent.)  A  native  of  Flanders,  where  he embraced  the  Religious  life.  At  the  persuasion of  St.  Ansgar,  he  accompanied  him  in  his Apostolate  of  Scandinavia  and  succeeded  him as  Archbishop  of  Bremen.  He  seems  to  have been  the  first  to  preach  the  Gospel  to  the  Pagans of  Brandenburg.  He  died  a.d.  888.  To  him we  owe  a  well-written  life  of  his  leader,  St. Ansgar.  

♦REMBERT  (REGNOBERT)  (St.)  M.  (June  13)  
(7th  cent.) A  pious  youth  of  the  Court  of 
King  Thierry  of  France,  murdered  (A.d.  675)  

because  of  his  inflexibility  in  living  a  clean 
life,  and  hence  honoured  as  a  Martyr.  

REMEDIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  3)  
(Date  uncertain.)  A  Bishop  of  Gap  in  the French  Alps,  the  successor  of  St.  Tyagris  or Tigis.  Nothing  reliable  can  be  cited  concerning him.  

REMIGIUS  (REMY)  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  1)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  in  Gaul  A.d.  439,  he  was consecrated  Archbishop  of  Rheims  when  only twenty-two  years  of  age,  and  governed  that illustrious  Church  for  over  seventy  years.  He was  looked  up  to  as  the  most  learned  and  most eloquent  Prelate  of  his  Age.  He  is  the  Apostle of  the  Franks,  of  whom  he  baptised  over  three thousand,  together  with  their  King  Clovis. He  died  Jan.  13,  a.d.  533,  and  has  ever  since been  venerated  as  one  of  the  greatest  glories of  the  French  Church.  His  Festival  is  generally kept  on  Oct.  1,  anniversary  of  the  Translation of  his  Relics.  

REMO  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  13)  

San  Remo  is  a  corrupt  form  of  the  name  of St.  ROMULUS,  which  see.  

♦REOLUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  25)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Frankish  monk,  disciple  of St.  Philibert,  and  successor  in  the  Archbishopric of  Rheims  of  St.  Nivard.  His  relics  were enshrined  in  the  Abbey  of  Orbais,  founded  by him  (A.D.  690  about).  

REPARATA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  8)  
(3rd  cent.)

After  enduring  terrible  tortures,  she  was beheaded  as  a  Christian.  Bystanders  assert that  at  the  moment  of  her  death  they  saw  a white  dove  fly  upwards  from  her  headless  trunk. St.  Reparata  is  venerated  chiefly  at  Florence and  at  Nice.  

RESPICIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  10)

RESTITUTA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  17)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  African  maiden,  victim  to heathen  fury  under  Valerian  (A.D.  255).  She was  put  on  board  a  boat  loaded  with  combustibles, which,  when  afloat,  was  set  on  fire. God's  Providence  allowed  what  remained  of  the boat  to  drift  to  the  Coast  of  Italy,  the  relics of  the  Saint  being  still  recognisable.  These relics  are  now  enshrined  in  one  of  the  churches of  Naples.  

RESTITUTA  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  27)  
(3rd cent.)  A Roman virgin of Patrician 
descent  who,  during  the  persecution  under  the 
229 

RESTITUTUS 
Emperor Aurelian, having taken refuge at Sora  in Campania, was  there  arrested as a Christian  and,  with  three  others  of  the  Faithful, put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded  (a.d.  272). RESTITUTUS  (St.)  M.  (May  29)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  Martyr  of  the  end  of the  third  century  under  Diocletian.  Original and  authentic  records  of  his  trial  and  execution have  come  down  to  our  own  times.  Restitutus was  a  mere  youth,  but  manfully  bore  witness to  Christ,  and  endured  torture  and  death  for His  sake.  A  Christian  matron  rescued  his remains  and  gave  them  honourable  burial  in the  Catacombs  of  the  Via  Nomentana. RESTITUTUS  (St.)  M.  (June  10)  

See  SS.  CRISPULUS  and  RESTITUTUS. RESTITUTUS, DONATUS, VALERIAN, FRUCTUOSA  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM. (Aug.  23) (4th cent.)  Syrian  Martyrs  (sixteen in number),  put  to  death  at  Antioch,  probably at  the beginning  of  the  fourth century,  but no  particulars  concerning  them  are  extant. RESTITUTUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Dec.  9)  
(Date  unknown.)  All  we  know  of  this African  Martyr  is  that  he  was  a  Bishop  of Carthage,  and  that  St.  Augustine  (towards  the end  of  the  fourth  century)  preached  a  Sermon in  his  honour  on  his  Feast  Day.  Unfortunately, the  Sermon  itself  has  been  lost. REVERIANUS,  PAUL  and  OTHERS  (June  1) (SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  St.  Reverianus,  a  Bishop,  and St.  Paul,  a  priest,  Italians  by  birth,  appear  to have  been  sent  into  Gaul  as  missionaries  by Pope  St.  Felix  I,  and  to  have  been  evangelising Autun  and  its  neighbourhood  at  the  time  when the  Emperor  Aurelian  vanquished  the  usurper Tetricus  at  Chalons  (a.d.  272).  Aurelian  was  a fierce  persecutor  of  Christians,  and  by  his orders,  Reverianus,  Paul,  and  ten  others  of  the Faithful  were  put  to  the  torture  and  afterwards beheaded.

♦RHUDLAD  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  4)  
(7th  cent.)  The  Title  Saint  of  the  church  of 
Llanshudlad  in  Anglesey.  She  is  said  to  have 
been  the  daughter  of  a  King  of  Leinster,  and 
to have  lived  in  the  seventh century.  But 
nothing  certain  is  known  about  her.  

♦RIAN  (RHEANUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (March  8)  
(Date  unknown.)  The Saint  who  has  left 
his name to Llanhrian in Pembrokeshire.  

William  of  Worcester  and  Leland  describe  him 
as an  Abbot, but  no  dates  nor  particulars 
concerning  him  are  ascertainable.  

RICHARD  (St.)  King.  (Feb.  7)  
(8th cent.) He seems to have been an 
Anglo-Saxon  chieftain  or  Under-King  in  Wessex, 
probably  of  part  of  Devonshire.  He  married  a 
relation  of  St.  Boniface,  the  Apostle  of  Germany, 
and  was  the  father  of  three  Saints,  SS.  Willi
bald, Winebald and Walburga.  He died  at 
Lucca  in  Italy  while  on  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome 
(a.d.  722),  and  many  miracles  testified  to  his 
sanctity.  

RICHARD  of  CHICESTER  (St.)  Bp.  (April  3)  
(13th  cent.)  Richard  De  Wiche,  born  near 
Worcester, distinguished himself from early 
230 

youth  by  his  piety  and  intellectual  ability. He  studied  at  Paris  and  Bologna  and,  returning to  England,  was  made  Chancellor  of  the  University of  Oxford.  He  was  a  devoted  friend  of St.  Edmund  of  Canterbury,  chosen  by  him  as his  chief  adviser,  and  attended  him  in  his exile.  Consecrated  Bishop  of  Chichester  (A.d. 1245),  he  bravely  defended  the  rights  of  his  See against  the  Royal  usurpations,  but  was  chiefly conspicuous  for  his  devotedness  to  his  flock and  for  his  care  of  the  poor.  He  died  at  Dover in  the  building  still  known  as  the  Maison  Dieu (A.d.  1253),  and  was  canonised  nine  years  later.

His  prayer  had  always  been  that  he might  die  for  Christ,  and  he  won  the  Martyr's crown  a  few  years  after  his  coming  on  the English  mission.  On  hearing  his  sentence  he exclaimed :  "  This  is  the  day  which  the  Lord hath  made  :  let  us  be  glad  and  rejoice  therein." He  was  executed  with  circumstances  of  great brutality  at  Tyburn  (A.D.  1583).  

RICHARD  (St.)  Bp.  (June  9)  
(12th  cent.)  Possibly  an  English  Saint. We  only  meet  him  in  the  South  of  Italy,  where he  is  venerated  as  the  first  Bishop  of  Andria. A  document  still  in  existence  proves  that  in A.D.  1196  he,  as  Bishop  of  Andria,  officiated at  a  Translation  of  Sacred  Relics,  and  it  is historically  certain  that  from  the  time  of  his passing  from  this  world  he  has  been  liturgically honoured  as  a  Saint.  

♦RICHARD  FETHERSTONE  (Bl.)  M.  (July  30) (16th  cent.)  One  of  the  chaplains  of  Queen Catharine  of  Aragon,  whose  cause  he  defended against  her  adulterous  husband.  He  was hanged  at  Smithfield  (a.d.  1540)  for  refusing to  take  the  unlawful  Oath  of  Supremacy  exacted by  King  Henry.  

♦RICHARD  KIRKMAN  (Bl.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  
(16th  cent.)  A  native  of  Yorkshire,  who having  received  priests'  Orders  at  Douai, laboured  for  four  years  on  the  English  Mission. Arrested  at  York  for  preaching  the  Catholic Faith,  sentence  of  death  was  pronounced  upon him.  He  suffered,  August  22,  A.D.  1582, having  passed  his  last  moments  in  fervent prayer.  

♦RICHARD  WHITING  (Bl.)  M.  (Nov.  14)  
(16th  cent.)  The  last  Abbot  of  Glastonbury, where  he  presided  over  nearly  one  hundred Benedictine  monks.  They  lived  lives  of  such fervour  and  usefulness  that  even  the  Royal visitors  sent  by  Henry  VIII  could  find  no  fault with  the  community.  But  the  holy  Abbot steadfastly  refused  to  subscribe  the  Oath  of Royal  Supremacy,  and,  on  that  account,  washanged  in  view  of  his  own  monastery  (Nov.  14,. a.d.  1539).  With  him  suffered  John  Thorne  and Robert  James,  monks  of  the  Abbey.

RICHARIUS  (RICARIUS,  RIQUIER)  (April  26) (St.)  Abbot.  

(7th  cent.)  A  French  priest  who  appears  to have  passed  some  time  in  England.  Favoured by  King  Dagobert,  he  founded  the  monastery of  Centual  (SaintRiquier)  near  Amiens.  He ended  his  days  (a.d.  645)  as  a  hermit  in  a neighbouring  forest.  

♦RICTRUDIS  (St.)  Widow.  (May  12)  
(7th  cent.)  A  devout  woman,  four  of  whose children  are  venerated  as  Saints.  On  the  death of  her  husband,  she  took  the  veil  at  the  hands of  St.  Amandus,  and  for  several  years  presided over  a  monastery  in  Flanders. She,  however,.

Otherwise  St.  NINIAN,  which  see. *RIOCH  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  1)  
(5th  cent.)  An  early  convert  made  by St.  Patrick  in  Ireland.  Rioch  was  likewise  by him  consecrated  Bishop,  but  from  love  of solitude  and  contemplation  he  soon  resigned that  office  and  retired  to  the  island  of  Innisboffin.  There  he  founded  a  monastery  over which  he  presided  until  his  death. RIPSIMIS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  VV.MM. (Sept.  29)  
(4th  cent.)  Armenian  Martyrs  of  the beginning  of  the  fourth  century.  Mention  is made  of  them  in  the  Acts  of  St.  Gregory  the Illuminator,  Apostle  of  Armenia.

(15th  cent.)  An  Italian  Saint  who,  after eighteen  years  of  married  life  lost  her  husband and  her  two  sons.  Feeling  herself  then  called to  the  Religious  Life,  she  professed  the  Rule  of St.  Augustine  at  Cassia,  her  native  place,  near Spoleto  in  Central  Italy.  In  a  chronic  and  very painful  malady,  her  patience,  cheerfulness  and union  by  continuous  prayer  with  Almighty  God never  forsook  her.  She  died  May  22,  A.D.  1456, and  both  in  life  and  after  death  has  worked many  miracles. RIXIUS  VARUS  (St.)  M.  (July  6)

♦ROBERT  (St.)  M.  (March  25)  
(12th  cent.)  A  child,  said  to  have  been  put 
to  death  out  of  hatred  of  Christianity  by  Jews

relics  were  venerated  in  the  Abbey  church.  

ROBERT  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  17)  
(11th  cent.)  The  sainted  Founder  of  the great  Benedictine  Abbey  of  Chaise-Dieu  in Auvergne,  in  which  he  guided  over  three hundred  monks  in  the  way  of  perfection, teaching  as  much  by  example  as  by  precept. He  died  A.D.  1067. ROBERT  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  29)  
(11th  cent.)  The  Founder  of  the  Cistercian Order  (so-called  from  its  first  monastery  of Citeaux  (Cistercium)  in  France.  It  is  a  branch of  the  Benedictine  Order  pledged  to  a  literal and  rigorous  observance  of  the  monastic  Rule. Out  of  devotion  to  Our  Blessed  Lady,  St. Bobert  enjoined  on  his  monks  the  wearing  of a  white  habit,  and  directed  that  all  the  churches of  his  Order  should  be  dedicated  to  her.  The Cistercians  are  now  most  generally  known  as Trappists  from  a  still  later  Reform  which  began in  the  monastery  of  La  Trappe  in  the  North of  France.  After  many  times  seeking  to  retire from  the  government  of  his  monastery,  St. Robert  died  A.D.  1098.

(12th  cent.) A  Yorkshire  priest  who  took 
the  monastic  habit  in  the  Benedictine  Abbey  of 
York,  but,  with  others  of  the  brethren,  passed 
to  the  Cistercian  Beform  already  established 
at  Rievaulx,  and  founded  Fountains  Abbey.  

Later  that  of Newminster  near Morpeth  was 
established,  with  St.  Robert  as  Abbot.  He  was 
favoured  with  the  gifts  of  prophecy  and  miracles, 
and  was  united  in  spiritual  friendship  with  St.  

Bernard  of  Clairvaux,  the  great  Saint  of  the 
Age,  and  with  St.  Godric,  the  holy  hermit  of 
Durham.  St.  Robert  died  a.d.  1159.

ROBUSTIAN  and  MARK  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  31)  
(Date  unknown.) Martyrs  venerated  at

(14th  cent.) A  citizen  of  Montpellier  in  the 
South  of  France,  who  devoted  his  life  to  the 
serving  of  the  plague-stricken. In  their  behalf

many  miracles. He  died  a.d.  1337,  and  has 
since  been  venerated  as  the  special  advocate 
of  the  sick.

another  as  fellow-prisoners  in  the  same  dungeon.  

Of  their  trial,  tortures  and  death  we  have  some

♦ROGER,  JAMES  (Bl.)  M.  (Nov.  14)  
(16th  cent.) A fellow-sufferer with Bl. Richard  Whiting,  his  Abbot,  at  Glastonbury. ROLLOCK  (ROLLOX)  (St.)  (Aug.  16)  

A  Scottish  corruption  of  the  name  of  St.  ROCH 
or  ROQUE,  which  see.  Forbes  notes  an  even 
more  grotesque variant  of  the same, SEEMI
ROOKIE,  the  title  of  a  chapel  at  Dundee.  

ROMANA  (St.)  V.  (Feb.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  maiden,  sister,  it would  seem,  of  St.  Firmina  (Nov.  24),  baptised by  Pope  St.  Sylvester.  Forsaking  her  home, she  took  refuge  with  a  band  of  Christian Solitaries  near  Todi  in  Umbria.  She  embraced with  ardour  their  life  of  penance,  but  was  soon called  to  a  better  world,  dying  at  the  age  of eighteen  (A.D.  324). ROMANUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  28)  
(5th  cent.)  A  native  of  Gaul,  and  brother of  St.  Lupicinus.  At  the  age  of  thirty-five  he established  himself  as  a  hermit  in  the  Jura mountains,  between  France  aiid  Switzerland. Many  disciples  soon  gatheredVround  the  two brothers,  who  thereupon  founded  several monasteries.  St.  Romanus  (writes  St.  Gregory of  Tours)  "  persisted  to  the  day  of  his  death (a.d.  461)  in  simplicity  of  life  and  in  the  doing of  good  works,  especially  in  charitably  visiting and  caring  for  the  sick." ROMANUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (May  22)  
(6th  cent.)  The  Benedictine  Order  venerates this  Saint  as  the  holy  hermit  who  (a.d.  494) ministered  to  St.  Benedict  in  his  solitude  at Subiaco,  near  Rome,  as  is  narrated  by  St. Gregory  the  Great.  The  tradition  is  that St.  Romanus  thence  went  to  France,  and  there founded  a  monastery  in  the  neighbourhood  of Auxerre,  where  he  died  late  in  the  sixth century. *ROMANUS  and  DAVID  (SS.)  MM.  (July  24)  
(11th  cent.)  Two  Princes,  sons  of  Vladimir, the  first  Christian  Duke  of  Muscovy  (Russia). Their  zeal  for  the  propagation  of  the  Christian Faith  led  to  their  martyrdom  at  the  hands  of their  heathen  fellow-countrymen  (a.d.  1010). St.  Romanus  is  known  in  the  East  as  St.  Boris, a  name  very  frequently  given  in  Baptism, and  St.  David  as  Gleb. ROMANUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Aug.  24)  
(1st  cent.)  The  disciple  and  successor  of St.  Ptolemy,  Bishop  of  Nepi  in  Tuscany, whither,  according  to  tradition,  they  had  both been  sent  as  missionaries  by  St.  Peter  the Apostle.  The  one  and  the  other  are  alleged to  have  suffered  martyrdom  before  the  close of  the  first  century. ROMANUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Oct.  6)  
(6th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Eleutherius in  the  See  of  Auxerre  in  France.  During  his three  years  of  Episcopate,  he  struggled  against Arianism  and  simony,  both  rife  at  that  period in  Central  France.  He  died  a.d.  564,  and  is commonly  venerated  as  a  Martyr,  though  of his  having  been  such,  historical  proof  is  not now  forthcoming. ROMANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  23)  
(7th cent.) An Archbishop of Rouen in Normandy, a prelate of great zeal and of 
232 

heroic  sanctity,  who  during  his  twelve  years  of Episcopate  effected  many  necessary  disciplinary reforms  in  his  Diocese.  He  died  a.d.  639.  

ROMANUS  and  BARULA  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  18) (4th  cent.)  St.  Romanus  was  a  zealous Catholic  of  Antioch  in  Syria  who,  in  the  persecution under  the  Emperors  Diocletian  and Galerius,  appears  to  have  incited  his  fellowChristians  to  resist  by  force  the  Imperial Officials  charged  to  desecrate  and  destroy their  churches.  For  this,  he  paid  with  his  life (a.d.  304).  A  little  boy,  Barula  by  name, for  persisting  that  there  is  only  One  God, shared  his  happy  lot.  

ROMANUS  (St.)  (Nov.  24)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  in  Gaul,  ordained  by St.  Martin  of  Tours  and  sent  by  him  to  evangelise the  South  of  France,  where  he  worked  many miracles.  He  died  in  St.  Martin's  arms  about A.D.  385.  

ROMARIC  (St.)  Abbot.  (Dec.  8)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  the  Royal  Blood  of  the Merovingians  who,  forsaking  the  Court,  retired to  the  monastery  of  St.  Columbanus  at  Luxeuil, of  which  later  he  was  appointed  Abbot.  He  was zealous  for  Religious  observance  of  the  Rule among  his  monks.  He  is  also  said  to  have founded  seven  convents  of  nuns,  close  the  one to  the  other,  with  the  intent  that  each  in  turn should  chant  the  Divine  Praises,  so  that,  neither by  day  nor  by  night,  should  their  Psalmody  be interrupted.  

ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (Jan.  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  Forty  Christian  soldiers  put  to 
death  outside  the  walls  of  Rome,  on  account 
of  their  religion,  under  the  Emperor  Gallienus 
(a.d.  262).  

ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (Jan.  21)  
(4th  cent.)  Thirty  soldiers  put  to  death in  Rome  as  Christians  under  Diocletian  (a.d. 304).  The  Martyrs  in  Rome  in  the  greater persecutions  were  almost  innumerable.  Nero, Domitian,  Septimius  Severus,  Decius,  Valerian, Aurelian,  and,  above  all,  the  systematic  Diocletian, with  his  brutal  colleague  Maximian Herculeus,  are  responsible  for  the  greater number.  But  Hadrian  and  Trajan  also  persecuted the  Church.  And  the  Antonines,  notably Marcus  Aurelius,  the  philosopher,  condemned many  citizens  to  death  for  despising  the  gods of  Rome.  From  the  time  that  the  Emperors themselves  insisted  upon  Divine  Honours  being paid  to  them  personally,  a  political  motive  also intervened.  Often  too,  in  the  first  four  centuries of  the  Christian  era,  there  were  riots in  which  Christians  were  massacred  by  the heathen  mob,  with  or  without  the  connivance of  the  authorities.  The  Martyrologies  mostly record  the  various  martyrdoms  under  the  head of  the  most  prominent  sufferer  or  sufferers. But  here  and  there,  we  find  entries  like  this  of Jan.  21,  in  which  no  individual  name  is  set down.  A  few  of  these  are  here  indicated.  

ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (March  1)  
(3rd cent.)  Two hundred and seventy 
Christians  condemned  to  death  and  executed 
in Rome under the Emperor Claudius II 
(A-D.  272  about).  

ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (March  2)  
(3rd  cent.)  Although  in  general  the  Church enjoyed  a  respite  from  persecution  under  the Emperor  Alexander  Severus,  yet  the  penal laws  were  still  in  force,  and  not  a  few  Christians were  put  to  death  during  his  reign.  Usually, they  were  such  as  were  denounced  in  the Provinces.  Those  who  suffered  in  Rome  itself about  a.d.  227,  under  the  Prefect  Ulpian,  are commemorated  on  March  2.  They  are  registered as  "  plurimi "  (very  many).  

ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (March  4)  
(3rd  cent.)  Nine  hundred  Roman  Christians of  whose  martyrdom  no  details  are  now  extant. They  appear  to  have  been  victims  of  a  massacre of  Christians  in  the  time  of  the  Emperor Valerian,  about  A.D.  260.

ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (March  14)  
(1st  cent.)  Forty-seven  Christians,  baptised by  St.  Peter,  whom  the  Emperor  Nero  caused to  be  beheaded  in  one  day.  

ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (April  10)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  number  of  Christians  whom Pope  St.  Alexander  baptised  during  his  imprisonment. They  were  taken  to  Ostia  and  put  on board  of  a  ship  which  was  then  sunk  at  sea (a.d.  115  about).  

ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (June  17)  
(Date  unknown.)  Two  hundred  and  sixtytwo  Martyrs  who  suffered  in  Rome  in  one  of  the persecutions.  The  Bollandists  place  their martyrdom  at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth century  ;  but  weighty  authorities  date  it  much 
ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (June  24)  
(1st  cent.)  These,  many  hundreds  in  number, are  the  Christians  put  to  death  by  the  Emperor Nero  (A.D.  64)  on  the  absurd  charge  that  it  was they  who  had  caused  the  great  Fire  of  Rome, probably  his  own  work.  The  strange  and horrible  deaths  they  suffered  are  well  known. Some,  sewn  up  in  the  skins  of  animals,  were thrown  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the  Amphitheatre  ; others,  besmeared  with  oil,  were  used  as  torches to  illuminate  the  Imperial  Gardens ;  others were  crucified,  &c,  &c.  

ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (Aug.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  Twenty-three  Christians  of  the company  of  St.  Abundantius  (Sept.  16),  put  to death  while  engaged  in  prayer.  Each  one signed  himself  with  the  sign  of  the  Cross  in  the act  of  laying  his  head  on  the  block.  They suffered  under  Diocletian  about  a.d.  303. The  Emperor  is  said  to  have  afterwards expressed  his  regret  that  he  had  not  had them  more  severely  treated  in  the  torture clifimfocr 
ROME  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (Aug.  10)  
(3rd  cent.)  One  hundred  and  sixty-five Christian  soldiers  put  to  death  under  Aurelian (A.D.  274).

(11th  cent.)  A  native  of  Ravenna  and founder  of  the  Order  of  the  Camaldolese  Hermits, a  branch  of  that  of  St.  Benedict,  which  had  its head  house  at  Camaldoli  near  Arezzo,  in Tuscany.  Though  most  austere  in  his  habits, St.  Romuald  was  conspicuous  for  the  cheerful kindliness  and  considerateness  with  which  he dealt  with  others.  He  died  June  19,  a.d.  1027  ; but  his  Feast  is  kept  on  Feb.  7,  the  anniversary of  the  Translation  of  his  relics.  His  Order has  survived  in  Italy  to  our  own  time.  

ROMULA,  REDEMPTA  and  HERUNDO  (July  23) (SS.)  vv.  

(6th  cent.)  Three  devout  maidens  personally known  in  Rome  to  Pope  St.  Gregory  the  Great, whose  edifying  life  of  self-denial  he  made  the text  of  one  of  his  extant  sermons.

ROMULUS  and  SECUNDUS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  24)  
(Date unknown.) African Martyrs, whose 
Acts,  like  so  many  others,  have  unhappily  been 
lost.  Many of the ancient Registers write 
Secundolus  for  Secundus.  

ROMULUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  6)  
(1st  cent.)  St.  Romulus  was  the  missionary sent  by  St.  Peter  to  evangelise  the  country round  Florence,  and  is  honoured  as  the  first Bishop  of  Fiesole.  With  other  Christians,  he was  put  to  death  in  the  reign  of  the  Emperor Domitian  (a.d.  81-96).  

ROMULUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  5)  
(2nd  cent.) An  Official  of  the  Court  of  the 
Emperor  Trajan  who,  for  remonstrating  with 

him  on  his  cruelty  to  the  Christians,  was  made to  share  the  fate  of  his  fellow-believers  (a.d. 112).
♦ROMULUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  13)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Genoa,  concerning whom  we  have  now  no  reliable  documents. His  name,  corrupted  to  San  Bemo,  has  remained to  a  well-known  coast  town  on  the  Mediterranean Riviera. *ROMULUS  and  CONINDRUS  (SS.)  Bps.  (Dec.  28)  
(5th  cent.)  Two  of  the  first  preachers  of Christianity  in  the  Isle  of  Man,  whither  they may  possibly  have  been  sent  by  St.  Patrick, their  contemporary,  then  engaged  in  the conversion  of  Ireland.  We  have  no  particulars of  their  lives.
♦RONALD  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  20)  
(12th  cent.)  An  Earl  or  chieftain  of  Orkney, and  a  warlike  prince,  who,  in  discharge  of  a  vow, built  the  Cathedral  of  St.  Magnus  at  Kirkwall. He  was  murdered  by  rebels,  a.d.  1158.  Many and  great  miracles  attested  his  sanctity. *RONAN  (St.)  Bp.  (June  1)

(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint,  Founder  of  the Abbey  of  Beaulieu  in  Argonne,  which  he governed  for  thirty  years.  He  retired  to  a hermitage  to  prepare  for  death,  and  passed  away a.d.  680.  There  are  several  Saints,  locally venerated  in  the  British  Isles  and  in  France  and Belgium,  of  the  same  or  similar  name.  The distinguishing  them,  the  one  from  the  other, is  often  very  difficult. ROQUE  (St.)  (Aug.  16)  

Otherwise  St.  ROCH,  which  see. ROSALIA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  4)  
(12th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Palermo  in Sicily,  of  which  city  she  was  a  native.  She passed  her  life  as  a  recluse  in  a  cave  on  a  hillside, not  far  from  Palermo,  and  died  there  at the  age  of  thirty  (a.d.  1160).  She  was  famous for  the  austerity  of  her  penitential  life  and  for the  many  miracles  wrought  in  answer  to  her prayers. ROSE  of  LIMA  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  30)  
(17th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Lima  in Peru.  Of  Spanish  origin,  she,  as  a  Sister  of  the Third  Order  of  St.  Dominic,  lived  a  life  of extraordinary  austerity  in  South  America,  beai  ing  patiently  the  painful  maladies  to  which  she was  subject.  She  died  in  her  thirty-first  year (a.d.  1617),  and  was  canonised  a.d.  1671. ROSE  of  VITERBO  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  4)  
(13th  cent.)  A  virgin  of  Viterbo  in  Central Italy  who,  being  unable  to  gain  admittance to  the  then  newly-founded  Franciscan  Order, lived  a  life  of  assiduous  contemplation  and penance  in  a  solitary  place  near  the  convent in  her  native  town.  She  died  about  a.d.  1252. ROSIUS  (St.)  (Sept.  1)

(6th  cent.) A  Leinster  Saint  who  had  under 
his  Rule  one  hundred  and  fifty  monks,  and  who 
is  one  of  the  number  of  the  Saints  styled  the 
"  Twelve  Apostles  of  Ireland." 
♦RUAN  (RUADHAN,  RUMON,  RONAN)  (June  1)  
(St.)  Bp.  

(5th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  (alleged  to  have been  consecrated  Bishop  by  St.  Patrick)  who came  to  labour  for  God  in  Cornwall.  The particulars  regarding  him  are  vague  and  uncertain. Probably,  this  is  one  of  the  instances in  which  the  personalities  of  several  of  God's servants  have  been  by  accident  confused  into one.  Various  churches  are  dedicated  to  St. Ruan  or  Ronan.  At  one  period,  he  lived  in Brittany,  where  he  is  equally  in  honour  as  in  the British  Isles.  Perhaps  it  was  in  Brittany  that he  ended  his  earthly  pilgrimage. RUDERICUS  (St.)  M.  (March  13)

(10th  cent.) A  Spanish  Bishop,  famous  for 
his  resistance  to  the  Mohammedan  Arabs  in  his 
day  overrunning  the  Peninsula.  In  his  old  age 
he  retired  to  a  monastery,  which  he  governed 
till  his  death  (A.D.  977).  

♦RUDOLPH  AQUAVIVA  and  OTHERS  (July  27)  
(Bl.)  MM.  

(16th  cent.) A  band  of  Jesuit  Saints  put  to 
death for the Faith in Japan (A.D. 1583).  

Their martyrdom was almost immediately 
followed by the miraculous conversion to 
Christianity  of  the inhabitants of  the  place 
where  they  suffered.  

♦RUELLINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  28)  
(7th  cent.) A  successor  of  St.  Tugwald  in 
Brittany,  and  by  him  appointed  his  successor  in 
the  See  of  Leon.  

RUFFILLUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  18)  
(4th  cent.) An  Athenian  sent  by  Pope  St.  

Sylvester to preach Christianity  at Forlim
popoli in Central Italy.  He is accounted 
Apostle  and  first  Bishop  of  that  city.  He  died 
(a.d.  382)  after  forty-seven  years  of  Episcopate.  

Forlimpopoli  was  destroyed  in  war  (a.d.  1360), 
when  the  See  was  transferred  to  Bertinora,  and 
the  relics  of  the  Saint  were  enshrined  anew  at 
Forli.  

RUFINA  and  SECUNDA  (SS.)  VV.MM. (July  10)  
(3rd  cent.) Two  sisters,  natives  of  Rome, 
whose promised husbands, terrified by the 
horrors  of  the  persecution  of  Christianity  then 
raging, had renounced the Christian Faith.  

In  its  profession,  on  the  contrary,  the  two  holy 
women  persevered  to  the  end,  neither  promises 
nor threats availing aught to shake their 
resolution.  After being put to the torture, 
they were beheaded (A.D. 257) under the 
Emperors  Valerian  and  Gallienus. Their  relics 
are  enshrined  in  the  Baptistery  of  the  Lateran 
Basilica.

(Date unknown.) Martyrs in one of the early  persecutions  at  Syracuse  in  Sicily.  Nothing more  is  now  known  about  them. RUFINUS  (St.)  M.  (July  30)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Christian  put  to  death on  account  of  his  religion,  in  one  of  the  early persecutions,  at  Assisi  in  Italy.  No  further record  exists.  We  have  a  Sermon  preached  in the  eleventh  century  by  St.  Peter  Damian on  the  festival  day  of  St.  Rufinus,  in  which he  gives  particulars  of  miracles,  then  recent, wrought  at  the  tomb  of  the  Saint. RUFINUS  (St.)  (Aug.  19)  
(Date  unknown.) A  Saint,  probably  a  priest, venerated  at  Mantua  in  North  Italy  from  ancient times  ;  but  all  records  of  him  are  lost. RUFINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  26)  
(5th  or  6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Capua, concerning  whom  we  only  know  that  he  has always  been  venerated  as  a  Saint,  and  that miracles  have  been  wrought  at  his  shrine. About  a.d.  800,  St.  Decorosus,  one  of  his  successors, translated  his  relics  to  the  Cathedral, and  has  left  an  account  of  the  wonderful testimony  given  on  that  occasion  by  Heaven to  his  sanctity. RUFINUS,  SILVANUS  and  VITELICUS  (Sept.  4) (SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.) Three  children  at  Ancyra in  Galatia  (Asia  Minor)  who  appear  to  have shared  the  fate  of  their  Christian  parents  in  one 234 

of  the  early  persecutions.  Together  with  them are  associated  in  the  old  Martyrologies  three other  Saints,  Magnus,  Castus  and  Maximus  ; but  nothing  has  come  down  to  us  concerning any  of  the  group. RUFINUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  There  is  great  difficulty  in  disentangling this  Saint  with  his  fellow-sufferers from  others  of  the  same  name,  and  especially from  St.  Rufinus  of  Assisi  (July  30).  The  St. Rufinus  of  Oct.  11  appears  to  have  been  a Bishop  of  the  Diocese  in  Italy  known  as  "  Dei Marsi,"  and  to  have  suffered  at  Rieti,  under  an Emperor,  Maximin  or  Maximian  ;  but,  whether under  Maximin  I  (A.D.  235,  about)  or  under  the more  notorious  Maximian  Herculeus,  the colleague  of  Diocletian  (at  the  close  of  the  third century  or  beginning  of  the  fourth),  is  uncertain. RUFINUS  and  RUFINIAN  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  9)  
(Date  unknown.) Two  brothers  of  whom  we only  know  that  they  suffered  death  together because  of  their  attachment  to  the  Christian Faith. RUFINUS,  VALERIUS,  MARK  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  16)

See  SS.  HERMOGENES,  CAIUS,  &c. *RUFUS  (St.)  (April  22)

See  SS.  CYRIL,  AQUILA,  &c. RUFUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  25)  

See  SS.  PAUL,  TATTA,  &c. RUFUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Aug.  27)  
(1st  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Capua,  in  the  South of  Italy,  sent  thither,  it  is  alleged,  by  St. Apollinaris,  the  disciple  of  St.  Peter.  It  is  not known  in  what  relation  he  stood  to  St.  Priscus, who  seems  to  have  been  the  first  Bishop  of Capua.  St.  Rufus  was  doubtless  a  Martyr ; but  again,  the  people  venerate  other  local Martyrs  bearing  the  same  name  of  Rufus,  and there  is  much  confusion  in  the  traditions  regarding them  respectively. RUFUS  and  CARPOPHORUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  27)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Capua,  under  Diocletian (A.D.  295).  This  St.  Rufus  was  only  a deacon,  and  is  clearly  a  distinct  personage  from the  ancient  Bishop  St.  Rufus,  of  Apostolic  times, though  some  of  the  particulars  alleged  of  the one  evidently  belong  to  the  life  of  the  other. RUFUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  An  early  Bishop  of  Metz.  No contemporary  documents  mentioning  him  remain, though  Venerable  Bede  in  the  eighth century  notices  a  Translation  of  his  relics. a.d.  400  is  often  given  as  the  year  of  his death. RUFUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  12)  
(Date  unknown.)  Venerated  as  the  first Bishop  of  Avignon  in  the  South  of  France.  No historical  document  is  available  ;  but  it  would hardly  be  safe  to  date  his  death  later  than A.D.  200. RUFUS  (St.)  (Nov.  21)  
(1st  cent.)  The  disciple  of  the  Apostles  whom St.  Paul  greets  in  writing  to  the  Romans (Rom.  xvi.  13).  Some  identify  him  with  Rufus, the  son  of  Simon  the  Cyrenian  (Matt.  xv.  21). Others  have  it  that  he  became  Bishop  of Thebes,  but  whether  of  the  Egyptian  or  of  the Grecian  city  of  that  name  does  not  appear. There  were  also  other  towns  of  the  same name. RUFUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  citizen  with  his  entire household.  All  suffered  death  in  the  great persecution  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  304).  Some say  that  this  family  had  been  converted  to Christianity  by  the  better  known  Martyr,  St. Chrysogonus. 
SABINIANUS 

RUFUS  and  ZOSIMUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  18)  
(2nd  cent.)  Two  early  Martyrs  at  Philippi in  Macedonia,  whom  St.  Polycarp,  later  in  the same  century  and  writing  to  the  same  Church, qualifies  as  "  most  happy  men."  They  suffered about  A.D.  109. *RUGG  (JOHN)  (Bl.)  M.  (Nov.  14)

(8th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  Malines  in Belgium.  An  Irishman  by  birth,  he  journeyed to  Rome,  where  he  was  consecrated  Bishop and  charged  with  the  preaching  of  Christianity in  Brabant.  His  mission  there,  eminently successful,  was  extended  from  time  to  time  to the  neighbouring  provinces.  On  one  of  his journeys,  he  was  set  upon  and  barbarously slain  by  evil-doers  (A.D.  775).  His  shrine  is  in Malines  Cathedral.
♦RUMON  (St.)  Bp.  (June  1)  
(Date  unknown.)  Venerated  at  Tavistock in  Devonshire  and  elsewhere  in  England.  He may  possibly  be  identical  with  one  of  the Saints,  Rumon,  or  Iluan,  or  Ronan,  assigned to  other  days  in  the  year ;  but  such  identity is  purely  conjectural.  
♦RUMWOLD  (St.)  (Aug.  28)  
(7th  cent.)  An  infant  Prince  of  the  Royal family  of  Northumbria,  who  is  said  miraculously to  have  spoken  and  to  have  made  open  profession of  the  Clrristian  Faith  immediately  after being  baptised,  and  to  have  died  (A.D.  650) shortly  afterwards.  This  led  to  his  having  the honour  of  a  place  in  Catalogues  of  Saints.  He was  venerated  chiefly  in  Northamptonshire  and in  Buckinghamshire. RUPERT  (St.)  Bp.  (March  27)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Frenchman  who  was  appointed Bishop  of  Worms  in  Germany,  but  was  unjustly driven  from  his  See.  He  then  undertook  the work  of  preaching  Christianity  in  Bavaria, Styria  and  other  parts  of  Upper  Germany. He  was  eminently  successful,  finally  fixing  his See  at  the  place  which  is  now  called  Salzburg, where  he  passed  away  on  Easter  Sunday,  A.D. 718. RUSTICA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  31)

in Auvergne, concerning whose election St.  

Gregory  of  Tours  relates  that  it  was  brought 
about by a special intervention of Divine

commended  by  the  lifelong  penance  he  inflicted 
on  himself  in  reparation  of  some  sin  of  his  youth.  

He  died  A.D.  574.  

RUSTICUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  26)  
(5th  cent.)  AnillustriousBishopof  Narbonne, 
in  the  South  of  France,  previously  a  monk  at 
Marseilles.  He  assisted  as  Bishop  at  the  great 
Council  of  Ephesus  (a.D.  431).  A.D.  462  is  the 
probable  date  of  his  holy  death.  

RUTILIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  2)  
(3rd cent.) This steadfast Christian, an 
African,  did  all  in  his  power  to  escape  arrest 
under  the  persecuting  edicts  of  his  time.  He 
wandered  from  place  to  place  ;  but  nevertheless, 
was  at  last  denounced and brought  to  trial.  

He  bore  himself  bravely  in  the  torture  chamber, 
and was afterwards burned to death. His 
martyrdom cannot be dated later  than the 
reign  of  Decius  (a.d.  250).

SABAS  (SABBAS)  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  St.  Sabas  was  a  Christian  soldier in  the  army  of  Athanaric,  King  of  the  OstroGoths,  who  ruled  over  the  country  north  of  the Danube,  now  known  as  Roumania.  In  a  local persecution  he  boldly  confessed  Christ  before his  judges  and,  after  being  put  to  the  torture, was  cast  into  a  river  and  left  to  drown  (A.D.  372). He  is  highly  honoured  among  the  Greeks;  and with  him  are  commemorated  several  other  brave Christians,  victims  of  the  same  persecution. SABBAS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  24)  
(3rd  cent.) A  Christian  officer  in  the  army of  the  Emperor  Aurelian,  and  seventy  other Christians  who  suffered  death  for  their  Faith in  Rome  (a.d.  272). SABBAS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Dec.  5)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Cappadocian  by  birth  who became  one  of  the  most  famous  of  the  Palestinian monks,  in  whose  discipline  he  established a  much-needed  Reform.  He  himself  was remarkable  for  his  austerity  of  life  and  for scrupulous  exactitude  in  the  observance  of his  monastic  Rule.  In  various  journeys  to Constantinople  he  rendered  great  service  to the  Eastern  Church,  then  much  troubled  by  the Eutychian  heretics.  He  died  A.D.  532,  at  the age  of  ninety-four. SABBATIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  19)

SABINA  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  29)  
(2nd  cent.) A  rich  widow  of  the  Province  of 
Umbria  in  Italy,  converted  to  Christianity  by 
the  instrumentality  of  her  slave  or  servant, 
St.  Seraphia,  later  adopted  by  her  as  a  daughter.  

Both  suffered  death  for  the  Faith,  St.  Sabina 
in  Rome,  about  A.D.  127,  and  St.  Seraphia, 
five  years  previously.  

SABINA  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  29)  
(3rd  cent.) A  Christian  maiden,  Greek  by 
birth,  and  sister  of  St.  Sabinian,  the  Martyr  of 
Troyes  (France), was,  it  is  said,  baptised  in 
Rome  by  the  priest  St.  Eusebius,  afterwards 
Pope.  Her  parents  were  still  heathens, and 
on  this  account  she  set  forth  to  rejoin  her 
brother  in  Gaul.  As  she  neared  the  city  of 
Troyes,  she  was  informed  of  his  glorious  death 
for  Christ, and  prayed God  that  she might 
soon  be  with  him  in  Heaven.  The  tradition  is 
that,  her  prayer  ended,  she  forthwith  peaceably 
passed  away  (about  A.D.  276).

Faith. He  was  arrested,  tortured  and  beheaded 
under  the  Emperor  Aurelian  (a.d.  275),  at  a 
village  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Troyes.  His 
remains  are  enshrined  in  the  Cathedral  of  that 
city.

See  SS.  PAUL,  TATTA,  &c. SABINIANUS  and  POTENTIANUS  (SS.)  MM.  

(Dec.  31) (1st cent.) Martyrs at Sens (France), of 
235 

SABINUS 
which  city  they  are  regarded  as  Patron  Saints, and  Sabinianus  as  first  Bishop.  They  are  said to  have  been  of  the  seventy-two  disciples  sent out  to  preach  by  Christ  himself,  and  to  have been  directed  to  Gaul  by  St.  Peter.  They appear  to  have  laboured  in  several  districts  in that  country,  until  eventually  put  to  death by  the  Pagans  at  Sens.  It  must,  however,  be borne  in  mind  that  many  moderns  postdate these  Martyrs  to  the  third  century.  

SABINUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  25)  

See  SS.  DONATUS,  SABINUS,  &c.  

SABINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  9)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Canusium  (a  town now  destroyed)  near  Bari  in  the  South  of  Italy. He  retained  that  See  for  more  than  fifty-two years,  and  is  said  to  have  been  over  a  hundred years  old  at  the  time  of  his  death  (a.d.  566). Not  only  was  he  in  the  highest  repute  for sanctity  and  zeal  among  his  own  flock,  but he  rendered  great  service  to  the  Church  at large,  especially  in  embassies  with  which  he was  charged  by  the  Popes  to  the  Byzantine Emperors.  

SABINUS  (St.)  M.  (March  13)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Martyr,  a  man  of noble  birth,  thrown  into  the  Nile  at  the  beginning of  the  persecution  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  287).  

SABINUS  (St.)  (July  11)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  saintly  disciples  of St.  Germanus  of  Auxerre,  by  whom,  it  is  said, that  he  was  miraculously  cured  of  a  mortal sickness,  and  afterwards  baptised.  He  is chiefly  venerated  in  the  neighbourhood  of Poitiers  ;  but  we  have  no  longer  any  reliable particulars  of  his  holy  life.  

SABINUS,  JULIAN,  MAXIMUS,  MACROBIUS, CASSIA,  PAULA  and  OTHERS (July  20) (SS.)  MM.  

(Date  uncertain.)  We  know  nothing  of  these Martyrs  save  the  fact  that  they  are  registered in  the  Martyrologies  as  Syrians.  Some  Catalogues add  twenty  African  Christians  to  their number.  

SABINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Piacenza  (Italy), a  colleague  of  St.  Ambrose,  who  used  to  send him  his  own  Works  for  revision  and  approval. He  seems  to  have  been  a  man  of  singular holiness  and  of  remarkable  erudition.  St. Gregory  the  Great  recounts  a  miracle  wrought by  him.  He  attended  various  Councils  against the  Arians,  and  in  some  played  a  very  prominent and  useful  part.  

SABINUS,  EXUPERANTIUS,  MARCELLUS, 
VENUSTIANUS  and  OTHERS  (Dec.  30)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(■4th  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Spoleto  (Italy)  in  the persecution  under  Diocletian.  St.  Sabinus was  a  Bishop,  and  Exuperantius  and  Marcellus, two  of  his  deacons.  But  Venustianus  was  the governor  of  Etruria  or  Tuscany.  To  him Maximian  Herculeus,  the  savage  colleague  of Diocletian,  had  addressed  a  special  Decree enjoining  the  persecution  to  death  of  all  Christians. Becoming  himself  a  convert,  Venustianus, with  his  wife  and  family,  shared  at Assisi  the  fate  of  the  two  deacons,  who  were beheaded.  St.  Sabinus  had  his  hands  cut  off, and  died  in  prison  a.d.  302.  

♦SACER  (MO-SACRA)  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  3)  
(7th  cent.) An  Irish  Saint  who  built  the 
monastery  of  Saggard,  which  he  governed  with 
zeal and  success. He  assisted  at  the great 
Synod  held  bv  Flann,  Archbishop  of  Armagh.  

SACERDOS  (SARDOU)  (St.)  Bp.  (May  4)  
(6th  cent.)  A  native  of  Bordeaux,  who founded  a  monastery  near  Perigueux,  and afterwards  became  Bishop  of  Limoges.  He was  famous  for  his  zeal  and  miracles.  He  died about  A.D.  530  (having  resigned  his  pastoral charge)  while  on  his  return  journey  to  his monastery,  where  his  relics  were  enshrined.  

SACERDOS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  5)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Spanish  Saint  honoured 236 

as  Bishop  of  Saguntuin  (Morviedo),  where  his relics  are.  Nothing  else  is  known  about  him.  

SACERDOS  (SERDOT)  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  12)  
(6th  cent.)  A  distinguished  Bishop  of  Lyons who  took  part  in  the  Council  of  Orleans  (a.d. 549).  He  died  at  Paris,  King  Childebert, whose  spiritual  adviser  he  had  been,  assisting at  his  deathbed.  His  remains  were  transported to  Lyons.  

♦SADOC  (St.)  M.  (June  2)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Dominican  Saint,  received into  the  Order  by  St.  Dominic  himself,  and  by him  sent  to  Hungary  and  Poland.  He  with  his community  of  forty  Religious,  suffered  martyrdom in  the  Tartar  Invasion  (A.D.  1260).  

SADOTH  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  in  Persia  who,  with  one hundred  and  twenty-eight  of  his  fellow  Christians, was  put  to  death  (A.D.  345)  by  King Sapor,  near  Ctesiphon,  soon  after  the  holy Bishop  Simeon.  

♦SADWEN  (SATURNINUS)  (St.)  (Nov.  29)  
(6th  cent.)  A  brother  of  St.  Ultyd  and disciple  of  St.  Cadfan.  Some  Welsh  churches are  dedicated  to  him.  He  lived  in  the  sixth century,  as  probably  did  also  another  Welsh Saint  of  the  same,  or  nearly  the  same,  name, Sadwen,  or  Sadyruyn,  of  Llansadwruen  in Carmarthenshire.  

SAGAR  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Oct.  6)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Laodicea  (Asia Minor)  who  was  put  to  death  as  a  Christian  in the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius. The  historian  Eusebius  and  others  of  the ancients  mention  him.  But  the  tradition  that he  was  a  disciple  of  St.  Paul  the  Apostle  seems quite  impossible  of  belief,  as  the  date  of  his death  must  have  been  about  a.d.  175,  more than  a  hundred  years  later  than  that  of  the Apostle.  

♦SAIR  (St.)  Bp.  (July  1)  

Otherwise  St.  SEE, VAN,  which  see.  

SALABERGA  (St.)  Widow.  (Sept.  22)  
(7th  cent.)  A  noble  French  woman  of Langres  who,  left  a  widow,  founded  and governed  as  Abbess  a  monastery  of  three hundred  nuns  at  Laon.  The  Chronicles  lay great  stress  on  her  gentleness  and  invariable cheerfulness.  

♦SALAUN  (St.)  (Nov.  1)  
(14th  cent.)  A  poor  man  in  Brittany  who, 
despised  by  all,  reached  a  height  of  interior 
sanctity  such  that  his  tomb  remains  to  this 
day  a  place  of  pilgrimage. He  died  a.d.  1358.  

SALLUSTIA  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  14)  

See  SS.  CtEREALIS,  PUPULUS,  &c.  

SALLUSTIANUS  (St.)  (June  8)  
(Date  unknown.) A  Saint  honoured  as  such

of  whom  nothing  more  is  now  known.  Some 
Catalogues  describe  him  as  a  Martyr.  

♦SALOME  and  JUDITH  (SS.)  (June  29)  
(9th  cent.)  Salome  is  said  to  have  been  an Anglo-Saxon  Princess,  on  whose  exile  in Germany,  Judith,  a  pious  widow,  took  pity^ They  are  venerated  in  Bavaria,  where  they  are reputed  to  have  lived  as  Recluses  ;  but  their" history  is  very  uncertain.  

♦SALOME  (St.)  (Oct.  22>' 
See  St.  MARY  SALOME.  

♦SALOMEA  (St.)  V.  (Nov.  17> 
(13th  cent.)  A  Polish  Saint  of  the  Franciscan. Order,  betrothed  in  her  early  years  to  a  prince, heir  to  the  throne  of  Hungary.  As  Abbess  of a  monastery,  she  governed  with  zeal  and  charity her  community,  and  terminated  her  labours by  a  holy  death  (Nov.  17,  A.D.  1268).  Her' sacred  relics  are  enshrined  at  Cracow.  

SALOMON  (St.)  M.  (March  13)' 
See  SS.  RUDERIC  and  SALOMON.  

♦SALOMON  (St.)  M.  (June  25)' 
(6th  cent.) A  Prince  or  Duke in  Cornwall 
who  married  St.  Gwen  and  was  father  of  St.  

Cybi.  He passed over into Brittany, over' 
which  he  ruled  until  assailed  by  the  heathen1 
SARAGOSSA 

malcontents  among  his  subjects.  They  murdered him  about  a.d.  550.  This  St.  Salomon is  sometimes  confused  with  Salomon  III,  also a  Duke  of  Brittany,  who  nourished  in  the  ninth century,  and  was  likewise  a  Saint  honoured  as a  Martyr.  

SALOMON  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  28)  
(Date  unknown.)  He  is  sometimes  set  down in  the  Manuscripts  as  St.  Salonius.  He  is always  described  as  having  been  Bishop  of Genoa,  and  rightly,  as  the  claims  of  Geneva and  of  the  Spanish  city  of  La  Puerta  (Janua) are  easily  ruled  out.  However,  his  cultus  at Genoa  in  Italy  was  only  established  in  the sixteenth  century.  

♦SALT  (ROBERT)  (Bl.)  M.  (May  4)  

See  CARTHUSIAN  MARTYRS.

♦SALVATOR  (Bl.)  (March  18)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Lay-brother  of  the Order  of  St.  Francis,  wonderful  for  his  piety  and virtue.  He  died  in  Sardinia,  a.d.  1567  ;  and, at  the  prayer  of  many  princes  and  great  men, Clement  XI,  after  the  lapse  of  more  than  a century,  placed  his  name  among  those  of  the Beatified.  

SALVINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  12)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Verona  (North  of Italy),  a  learned  and  eloquent  Prelate,  remarkable not  only  for  his  holiness  of  life  but  for  his extreme  gentleness  in  treating  with  others. a.d.  562  is  given  as  the  likely  date  of  his  death.  

SALVIUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  11)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  African  Martyr, otherwise  unknown,  of  whom  Possidius  tells  us that  St.  Augustine  preached  the  Panegyric.  

SALVIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  11)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Amiens,  in  which  See he  succeeded  St.  Honoratus.  He  was  famous for  miracles  and  for  his  gift  of  supernatural prayer.  He  died  a.d.  695.  Some  years  later, his  body  was  transferred  to  Montreuil.  

SALVIUS  and  SUPERIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  26) (8th  cent.)  St.  Salvius,  born  in  the  South of  France,  became  Bishop  of  Angoul§me.  He later  undertook  the  preaching  of  Christianity to  the  Pagans  of  Flanders,  and  met  his  death at  their  hands  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Valenciennes, together  with  St.  Superius,  his  priest or  deacon.  

SALVIUS  (SAUVE)  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  10)  
(6th  cent.)  St.  Gregory  of  Tours  gives  some account  of  his  life  and  miracles.  He  was,  it  is most  likely,  of  Frankish  extraction,  and  from being  a  monk  and  later  an  Abbot,  was  promoted to  the  Bishopric  of  Albi,  where  he  devoted  himself to  his  flock.  He  was  especially  careful  of his  poor,  among  whom  he  more  than  once distributed  all  the  goods  he  had.  There  is  a certain  confusion  in  some  of  the  Chronicles, not  all  of  which  disentangle,  in  regard  to  details, what  regards  St.  Salvius  of  Albi  from  matters connected  with  St.  Salvius  of  Amiens  and St.  Salvius  of  Angouieme.  All  three  were French  Saints  and  Bishops,  and  more  or  less contemporaries.  

SAMONAS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  15)  

See  SS.  GURIAS  and  SAMONAS.  

SAMPSON  (St.)  (June  27)

It  is  related  of  him  that  when  the  Emperor  was lavishing  money  on  the  building  of  the  magnificent Cathedral  of  St.  Sophia,  St.  Sampson insisted  on  the  prior  claim  of  the  sick  and distressed,  and  that,  side  by  side  with  the spacious  church,  should  be  erected  a  great Hospital,  worthy  of  its  position  and  of  the Imperial  magnificence.  

SAMPSON  (St.)  Bp.  (Julv  28)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Saint,  disciple  of  St. Illtyd.  He  was  a  monk  of  Caldey,  but  afterwards  became Abbot of Llantwit.  Thence

He  died,  and  was  buried  in  his monastery  at  Dole  ;  but  his  relics  were  afterwards translated  to  Paris. *SAMSON  XENODOCHIUS  (St.)  (June  27)

The  First  Book  of  Kings, on  that  account  often  called  the  First  Book  of Samuel,  contains  the  history  of  the  Prophet, the  wonders  of  his  birth  and  childhood  (i.,  ii.)  ; his  Judgeship  of  Israel  (iv.-vii.) ;  his  anointing Saul,  King  (viii.-x.) ;  his  replacing  him  by David  (xvi.) ;  and  his  death  (xxv.). SAMUEL  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  13)  

See  SS.  DANIEL,  SAMUEL, &c. *SANANUS  (St.)  (March  6)  
(5th  cent.) An  Irish  Saint,  Patron  of  PlouSane  in  Brittany,  where  he  died  A.D.  485. SANCIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  5)  
(9th  cent.)  A  youth  of  Cordova  in  Spain, put  to  death  by  the  Mohammedans,  out  of hatred  of  the  Christian  religion  (a.d.  851). St.  Eulogius  tells  us  that  St.  Sancius  perished by  the  Eastern  punishment  of  impalement. *SANCTAN  (St.)  Bp.  (May  9)  
(6th  cent.) A  Briton  who,  crossing  over  to 
Ireland,  was  made  Bishop  of  a  See  near  Dublin.

SANCTINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  22)  
(Date  unknown.)  Alleged  to  have  been  the first  Bishop  of  Meaux  and  a  disciple  of  St.  Denis of  Paris.  This  would  place  him  in  the  third  or fourth  century  of  the  Christian  era,  accepting the  modern  theory  of  the  dates  of  St.  Denis  and other  Apostles  of  Gaul.  St.  Sanctinus,  or another  Saint  of  the  same  name,  is  claimed also  by  Verdun.  We  have  nothing  certain to  relate  of  either. SANCTUS  (St.)  M.  (June  2)  

See  SS.  PHOTINUS,  SANCTUS, &c. SANDOLUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  3)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Spanish  Martyr,  probably of  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century. Beyond  the  mention  of  him  in  connection  with Cordova,  in  the  Catalogues  of  Martyrs,  we  have no  information  respecting  him. SAPIENTIA  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  30)  

Otherwise  St.  SOPHIA,  which  see. SAPOR,  ISAAC  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM. (Nov.  30)  
(4th  cent.)  A  band  of  Martyrs  in  Persia  who

They  suffered  in  the  persecution ordered  by  Diocletian  and  under  the  Prefect Dacian,  notorious  for  the  savagery  he  displayed in  carrying  out  the  behests  of  his  Imperial master  (a.d.  304).  Most  of  them  were  put  to death  on  one  and  the  same  day  ;  the  others after  a  second  examination.  Their  relics, discovered  in  a.d.  1389,  are  enshrined  at  Saragossa.

SARAGOSSA 
SARAGOSSA  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (Nov.  3)  
(4th  cent.)  Christians  of  Saragossa,  other than  the  Martyrs  commemorated  on  April  26, done  to  death  in  the  same  year  (A.D.  304), in  the  last  great  persecution,  that  of  Diocletian and  his  colleagues.  The  pitiless  Datian  (or Dacian),  the  Official  charged  with  the  enforcing in  Spain  of  the  Imperial  edicts,  had  his  residence in  Saragossa.  The  number  of  his  victims  in that  city  and  its  neighbourhood  is  incredible. Neither  age  nor  sex  were  respected.  All  alike were  savagely  tortured,  and  in  various  fashions made  away  with.  The  bones  of  Christians, heaped  together  and  bleached  in  the  sun, formed  for  long  afterwards  a  little  white  hillock. Hence  the  name,  by  which  the  Saragossa Martyrs  of  a.d.  304  were  known  (like  others  in Africa)  of  the  "  Massa  Candida  (White  Mass)." SARBELIUS  and  BARBEA  (SS.)  MM. (Jan.  29)  
(2nd  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Edessa  in  Syria (a.d.  101),  under  the  Emperor  Trajan.  They were  brother  and  sister.

He  was  put  to  death  in  his  monastery  by  a  band of  wandering  Arabs  (a.d.  357),  but  has  always been  honoured  as  a  Martyr  for  having  suffered in  the  cause  of  right.

They  are  registered  in the  lists  immediately  after  the  betterknown SS.  Martinian  and  Saturninus,  and  together with  them  is  noted  another  company  of  nearly three  hundred  sufferers.  There  is  much  controversy respecting  them,  particularly  as  regards date  and  place,  among  the  learned. SATURNINUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  30)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  at  Cagliari  (Sardinia) in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  303). Manuscript  Acts  of  this  Saint  were  extant  in the  sixteenth  century,  but  appear  to  have  been since  lost. SATURNINUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  27)

They  are  associated  with  Pope  St. Marcellus  and  with  SS.  Cyriacus,  Largus  and Smaragdus.  They  were  both  very  aged  ; but were  not  on  that  account  spared  the  torture before  execution.  St.  Sisinnius  was  a  deacon. SATURNINUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Nov.  29)  
(3rd  cent.)  This  is  St.  Sernin,  the  Saint  of Toulouse.  He  was  a  missionary  sent  from  Rome by  Pope  St.  Fabian  (A.D.  251)  to  preach  in Southern  Gaul,  where  he  founded  the  Bishopric of  Toulouse.  St.  Sernin,  after  converting  a multitude  of  heathens,  was  arrested  in  the persecution  under  Valerian  (a.d.  257),  and  put to  an  exceptionally  cruel  death,  being  fastened behind  a  wild  bull  which  dragged  him  about until  he  was  dashed  to  pieces. *SATURNINUS  (St.)  (Nov.  29)

(4th  cent.) The  elder  brother  of  St.  Ambrose 
of  Milan.  He  was  a  layman  of  singular  ability 
and  irreproachable  integrity.  He  had  reached

Baptism,  when  taken  ill  while  on  a  journey 
from  Rome.  He  rejoined  his  brother  and  their 
sister, St.  Marcellina  at  Milan ; but  shortly 
afterwards,  to  their  great  grief,  passed  away  in 
some year between a.d. 379 and A.D. 392.  

St.  Ambrose  wrote  his  touching  Essay,  "  On 
the  death  of  a brother," in  praise of 
Satyr  us.

St. Gregory  the  Great  relates  of  her  that  by  her prayers  she  miraculously  obtained  opportune rain  from  Heaven ;  and  again  that  at  the moment  of  her  holy  death  (a.d.  543)  St.  Benedict in  a  vision  saw  her  innocent  soul,  in  the semblance  of  a  white  dove,  wing  its  flight heavenwards. *SCHOTIN  (SCARTHIN)  (St.)  (Jan.  6)

Christian,  no  mercy  was  shown  him.  Tied  to 
a  tree,  his  body  was  made  a  target  for  the 
Roman  archers,  after  which,  it  being  discovered 
that  he  was  still  breathing,  he  was  clubbed  to 
death  (a.d.  288).

the  Archbishopric  of  Turin  offered  him  by  King 
Victor Amadeus of Piedmont, who greatly 
esteemed  and  respected  him.  He  literally  sold 
all  his  goods  and  gave  the  proceeds  to  the  poor.

(2nd  cent.)  A  young  man  of  Asti  in  Piedmont, converted  and  instructed  in  the  Christian religion  by  SS.  Calocerus  and  Marcianus. Suspicion  was  drawn  upon  him  by  the  care  he bestowed  to  secure  the  reverent  interment  of the  latter  Martyr ;  and  he  was  made  to  share the  prison  of  the  former.  In  due  course,  he  was brought  to  trial  as  a  Christian  and,  after  sentence, put  to  the  torture  and  beheaded  (A.D. 134,  about). SECUNDUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  15)

Constantius,  was  intruded  in  his  place. This 
George forthwith set about persecuting the 
Catholic  Bishops  and  clergy  of  Egypt.  Secun
dus  and  many  other  priests  were  scourged  to 
death.  Some  sixteen  Bishops  were  banished  ; 
and  a  multitude,  both  of  clergy  and  laity,  were 
savagely  maltreated,  so  that  many  died  of  the 
ill-usage  received  (A.D.  357).  They  were 
rightly  honoured  as  Martyrs.

(6th  cent.) Bom  in  Maglachla  (a.d.  488), 
St.  Senan  was  a  disciple  of  Abbots  Cassidus  and 
Natalis. Having  established  a  monastery  in 
the  Island  of  Inniscorthy  (Leinster),  he  visited 
Rome  and  Gaul,  and  became  most  intimate  with 
St.  David.  He  returned  to  Ireland  and  died 
in  Iniscarra,  about  a.d.  560. A  church  near 
Land's  End  in  Cornwall  is  dedicated  to  him, 
though  a  priest  associated  with  St.  Germanus 
of  Auxerre,  of  much  earlier  date,  may  be  the 
true  Title  Saint.  

♦SENAN  (St.)  (April  29)  
(7th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  a  hermit  in 
North  Wales.  There  is  much  confusion  in  the 
records  of  Saints  of  this  and  similar  names, 
and  consequently  it  is  not  possible  to  be  precise 
in  giving  an  account  of  them.  

SENATOR  (St.)  Bp.  (May  28)  
(5th  cent.) A  native  of  Milan  and  Bishop 
of  that  city  from  a.d. 478  to  a.d. 480 ; a 
learned  and  eloquent  prelate.  He  appears  to 
have  attended  the  Council  of  Chalcedon  when  a 
young  priest.  There  is  still  extant  a  Panegyric 
of  him  written  in  verse  by  the  poet  Ennodius.  

SENATOR  (St.)  (Sept.  26)  
(Date  unknown.) All  particulars  concerning 
this Saint have been lost.  The lists give 
"  Albanum  "  as  the  place  of  his  death.  The 
most probable conjecture is that the town 
referred  to  is  Apt  in  the  South  of  France,  not 
far  from  Viviers,  which  was  anciently  known  as 
Alba  Helvetiorum.

He died  A.D.  580. SERAPHIA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  29)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  of  Syrian origin,  who  lived  in  Rome  on  the  Mount Aventine  as  the  adopted  daughter  of  St.  Sabina, a  noble  matron  whom  she  converted  to  Christianity. Seraphia,  arrested  and  beheaded (a.d.  122),  was  given  honourable  burial  by Sabina,  who  later  herself  won  the  crown  of martyrdom. SERAPHINA  (St.)  (July  29)  
(Date  unknown.)  We  have  no  record  of  this Saint,  except  that  in  the  Martyrologies  she  is said  to  have  been  of  "  Civitas  Mamiensis." It  is  only  by  guesswork  that  some  have  identified this  place  with  a  town  in  Armenia ;  others with  one  in  Spain. SERAPHINUS  (St.)  (Oct.  12)  
(17th  cent.)  A  Capuchin  Friar,  an  Italian of  Fermo,  who  lived  a  wonderful  life  of  selfdenial  and  charity  as  a  Lay-brother  in  the Convent  of  his  Order  at  Ascoli,  where  he  died a.d.  1604.  He  was  canonised  a.d.  1767. SERAPION  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  25)

He  may  have  survived  another  twenty  years after  the  Council.  He  was  associated  both with  St.  Athanasius  and  St.  Antony.  St. Jerome  also  makes  mention  of  him.  He  was  a learned  man  and  wrote  several  works,  of  which by  far  the  most  important  is  his  "Liturgy," discovered  in  our  own  time,  and  first  published A.D.  1899.

(2nd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Antioch  of  great piety  and  learning.  The  historian  Eusebius, and  later  St.  Jerome,  have  both  written  in  his praise.  All  but  a  few  fragments  of  his  works have  perished,  a.d.  199  is  given  as  the  year  of his  death.  

SERAPION  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Alexandria  in Egypt  who  perished  in  a  riot  raised  by  the Pagans  against  the  Christians.  He  was  grievously maltreated,  and  in  the  end  cast  down from  the  roof  of  his  own  house,  a  high  building, by  the  infuriated  mob  (A.D.  252).  

SERAPION  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  14)  
(13th  cent.)  A  Religious  of  the  Order  of Our  Lady  of  Ransom,  by  birth  an  Englishman, who,  having  surrendered  himself  as  a  pledge for  the  paying  of  the  ransom  of  eighty-seven Cliristian  captives  at  Algiers,  exasperated  the Moors  by  seeking  to  make  converts  to  Christianity, on  which  account  they  crucified  him (A.D.  1240).  

SERDOT  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  12)  

Otherwise  ST.  SACERDOS,  which  see.  

SERENA  (St.)  (Aug.  16)  
(3rd  cent.)  Described  as  the  wife  of  the Emperor  Diocletian,  and  as  secretly  a  Christian. She  certainly  sought  as  far  as  was  in  her  power to  mitigate  the  lot  of  the  Christians.  After  her death  they  venerated  her  as  a  Saint.  The  little we  know  of  her  comes  from  the  Acts  of  St. Susanna,  V.M.,  and  from  those  of  Pope  St. Caius  (A.D.  283-296).  

SERENUS  (St.)  M.  (June  28)  

Two  of  this  name  are  registered  as  fellowsufferers  with  St.  PLUTARCHUS,  which  see.  

SERF  (St.)  Bp.  (July  1)  

Otherwise  St.  SERVAN,  which  see.  

SERGIUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  24)  
(4th  cent.)  A  monk,  perhaps  a  priest,  in Cappadocia  (Asia  Minor),  who  fell  a  victim  to the  persecution  under  Diocletian  (A.D.  304). He  was  remarkable  for  the  boldness  of  his answers  when  brought  before  the  heathen judge.  The  Christians  secured  his  body  after execution.  It  is  said  to  have  been  later  translated to  Spain.  

SERGIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  27)  

See  SS.  MAURUS  and  SERGIUS.  

SERGIUS  (St.)  Pope.  (Sept.  9)  
(8th  cent.)  Of  Syrian  parentage,  but  born 
at  Palermo  in  Sicily,  St.  Sergius  I  ruled  the 
Church  from  a.d.  687  to  A.D.  701.  He  bravely 
resisted  the  encroachments  of  the  Emperors  of 

Constantinople,  and  rejected  their  false  Synod of  A.D.  691,  known  as  the  Trullanum  or  FifthSixth.  He  sent  SS.  Chilian,  Swithbert,  Willibrord  and  others  as  missionaries  to  the  heathens of  Germany.  To  him  is  attributed  the  introduction of  the  Agnus  Dei  into  the  Canon  of  the Mass.  

SERGIUS  and  BACCHUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  7)  
(2nd  cent.)  Romans  by  birth  and  officers in  the  Imperial  army,  who  were  put  to  death by  order  of  Diocletian  or  of  one  of  his  colleagues, towards  the  end  of  the  third  century.  The prolix  accounts  written  in  the  early  Middle Ages  of  their  glorious  deaths  for  Christ  seem of  too  late  date  to  be  really  reliable.  But  the extension  of  their  cultus  throughout  the  Church was  so  rapid  as  to  indicate  distinctive  features in  their  Passion.  

SERNIN  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Nov.  29)  

Otherwise  St.  SATURNINUS,  which  see.  

SEROTINA  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  31)  

See  SS.  DONATA,  PAULINA,  Ac.  

♦SERVAN  (SERF,  SAIR)  (St.)  (July  1)  
(5th  cent.)  The  Apostle  of  the  Orkney  Isles, consecrated  Bishop  by  St.  Palladius.  The traditions  concerning  him  are  very  vague  and contradictory.  From  a  connection  asserted between  St.  Servan  and  St.  Kentigern,  it  may reasonably  be  inferred  that  there  were  two Saints  of  the  former  name,  and  that  the  one lived  a  century  later  than  the  other.  

SERVANDUS  and  GERMANUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  Victims  of  the  persecution  under 
Diocletian in the first years of the fourth 
century.  They  suffered  at Cadiz, and  their 
memory  is  in  great  honour  throughout  Spain.  

SERVATIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (May  13)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Tongres  in  the  Low Countries,  whence  the  See  was  later  transferred to  Maestricht.  St.  Gregory  has  left  us  a  long account  of  St.  Servatius  and  of  the  many miracles  he  wrought.  He  made  a  remarkable prophecy,  foretelling  the  invasion  of  the  Huns, which  was  fulfilled  a  century  later.  One  of  his merits  was  his  having  given  hospitality  to St.  Athanasius,  when  the  latter  had  been  driven from  Egypt  by  the  Arians.  St.  Servatius  died A.D.  384.

SERVULUS  (St.)  (Dec.  23)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  man  who,  paralysed  all  his life  long,  passed  his  days  in  prayer  in  the  porch of  the  church  of  St.  Clement  in  Rome.  When the  hour  of  his  death  arrived  he  bade  those surrounding  him  to  cease  from  their  chant  of Psalms,  as  he  already  heard  their  words  taken up  by  the  Angels  in  Heaven.  St.  Gregory  the Great  describes  the  scene  in  one  of  his  Homilies, and  seems  to  have  known  St.  Servulus  personally.  

SERVUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  17)  

See  SS.  LIBERATUS,  BONIFACE,  Ac.  

SERVUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  7)  
(6th  cent.)  One  of  the  victims  in  Africa  of the  persecuting  fury  of  the  Arians  under Hunneric,  King  of  the  Vandals.  St.  Servus died  in  the  torture  chamber  about  a.d.  505. He  was  a  man  of  noble  birth,  and  otherwise distinguished.  What  we  know  of  him  is taken  from  the  Life  of  St.  Eugene,  the  MartyrBishop  of  Carthage,  written  by  their  contemporary, Victor  Vitensis,  the  historian.

♦SETHRYDA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  10)  
(7th  cent.) A  daughter  of  a  King  of  East 
Anglia,  who,  with  her  sister,  St.  Ethelburga, 
241 

SEVEN 
and  her  niece,  St.  Ercongotha,  became  a  nun under  St.  Burgondofora,  or  Fara,  in  the  Abbey  of Faremoutier  in  France.  St.  Sethryda  in  due time  was  chosen  as  its  Abbess.  She  passed away  about  A.D.  660.  

SEVEN  BROTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  10)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  seven  sons  of  St.  Felicitas the  Martyr.  The  names  registered  are  Januarius,  Felix  and  Philip,  scourged  to  death ; Sylvanus,  thrown  headlong  over  a  precipice  ; Alexander,  Vitalis  and  Martial,  beheaded. Their  mother  was  also  beheaded  four  months later.  These  Martyrs  appear  to  have  suffered under  the  Emperor  Antoninus  Pius  (A.D.  150) ; though  some  scholars  insist  upon  a  later  date, under  Marcus  Aurelius.  Their  death  seems to  have  been  rather  instigated  by  the  heathen priests  than  to  have  been  an  incident  in  a general  persecution  of  Christians.  They  are amongst  the  most  famous  of  Roman  Martyrs.  

SEVEN  FOUNDERS  OF  THE  SERVITE  ORDER (SS.)  (Feb.  11)  
(13th  cent.)  Seven  Florentine  noblemen, Bonajuncta  Mannetti,  Manettus  of  Antella, Amideus  Amidei,  Uguccio  Uguccioni,  Sostineus Sostinei  and  Alexius  Falconieri,  who  (A.D.  1233) retired  from  the  world  and  laid  the  foundations of  the  illustrious  Order  of  Servants  of  the Blessed  Virgin  Mary,  known  as  Servites.  The Order  was  afterwards  approved  by  Pope Innocent  IV.  Their  life  was  one  of  singular austerity,  and  their  great  devotion  that  to  the Seven  Dolours  of  Our  Blessed  Lady.  The Order  quickly  spread,  especially  in  Italy,  and brought  forth  many  holy  men,  eminent  for  their zeal  and  for  their  successful  missionary  labours. The  Seven  Holy  Founders,  each  famous  for  the working  of  miracles,  though  they  died  in  different years,  have  always  shared  a  single  tomb. They  had  for  six  hundred  years  been  venerated as  Saints,  when  Pope  Leo  XIII  solemnly  canonised them  (A.D.  1888).  

SEVEN  SLEEPERS  (SS.)  (July  27)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Gregory  of  Tours,  a  historian of  the  sixth  century,  gives  the  accepted  tradition concerning  these  Saints.  They  were  Christians of  Ephesus,  victims  of  the  persecution  under Decius  (a.d.  250).  They  had  taken  refuge in  a  cavern  at  the  base  of  a  hill,  and  in  place  of being  beheaded  were  walled  up  therein  to  die of  hunger.  In  the  time  of  the  Emperor  Theodosius  (more  than  a  hundred  years  later)  a heresy  had  arisen  denying  the  Resurrection  of the  body.  The  tradition  is  that  by  chance the  cavern  of  the  Martyrs  was  then  rediscovered and  opened.  Whereupon,  the  Seven  Saints came  forth,  gave  public  testimony  to  that article  of  Faith,  and  returned  to  their  restingplace,  thus  passing  for  ever  from  this  world. It  is  added  that  on  a  leaden  plate,  in  or  near the  cave,  were  found  their  names  and  the  date of  their  martyrdom.  The  names  are :  Maximian,  Marcus,  Martinianus,  Dionysius,  John, Serapion  and  Constantine.  Many  further developments  of  the  story  of  the  Seven  Sleepers were  later  introduced,  and  several  rival  accounts ; but  in  one  form  or  another  it  obtained  universal credence.  Even  Mahomet  introduced  a  myth borrowed  from  it  into  his  Koran.  The  Greeks and  all  other  Eastern  Churches  note  the  Seven Sleepers  in  their  Catalogues  of  Saints.  

SEVERA  (St.)  (July  20)  
(7th  cent.)  The  sister  of  Bishop  St.  Modoald of  Treves,  Abbess  of  a  monastery  of  nuns founded  by  him ;  a  Religious  of  austere  and prayerful  life  who  preceded  her  holy  brother to  Heaven  (a.d.  645).  

SEVERIANUS  and  AQUILA  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  23)  
(Date  unknown.) African  Martyrs  of  Cae
sarea  in  Mauritania. Their  names  are  registered 
in all  the ancient  Martyrologies.  We know 
nothing  more  of  them.  

SEVERIANUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Feb.  21)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Scythopolis  (Beth242 

san),  in  Galilee,  near  the  Jordan,  who,  returning from  the  great  Council  of  Chalcedon  (A.D.  451), was  done  to  death  by  the  Eutychian  heretics with  the  connivance  of  the  Empress  Eudocia. SEVERIANUS  (St.)  M.  (April  20)  

See  SS.  VICTOR,  ZOTICUS, &c. SEVERIANUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Armenian  Saint,  tortured  to death  under  the  Emperor  Licinius  (a.d.  322) after  he  had  caused  the  celebrated  Forty  Martyrs of  Sebaste  to  perish  on  a  frozen  lake.  St. Severianus  was  adjudged  guilty,  not  only  of being  a  Christian,  but  of  having  induced  many Pagans  to  believe  in  Christ. SEVERIANUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  8)  

One  of  the  Holy  FOUR  CROWNED  MARTYRS, which  see. SEVERINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  8)  
(5th  cent.)  There  is  considerable  difficulty in  identifying  this  Saint.  The  Martyrology notice  describing  him  as  brother  of  the  Martyr St.  Victorinus  can  scarcely  be  upheld.  He  was probably  the  missionary  Bishop  or  Abbot, St.  Severinus,  who  evangelised  the  countries bordering  on  the  Upper  Danube,  and  whose body  was  brought  to  Naples  six  years  after  his death  (a.d.  482). SEVERINUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  11)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Burgundian,  Abbot  of  the famous  monastery  of  Agaune  (the  scene  of  the martyrdom  of  the  Theban  Legion)  in  Switzerland, a  man  of  eminent  sanctity,  and  worker of  many  miracles,  of  some  of  which,  Clovis, First  Christian  King  of  the  Franks,  was  eyewitness. He  died  near  Sens,  a.d.  507. SEVERINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  8)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Italian  Saint,  Bishop  of Septempeda  (San  Severino)  near  Ancona.  He was  a  wealthy  man,  and  had  given  all  his  goods to  the  poor,  and  retired  into  a  monastery  when Pope  Vigilius  (a.d.  540)  forced  him  to  accept a  Bishopric.  He  governed  his  flock  faithfully in  terrible  times  of  devastating  war,  dying about  a.d.  550,  shortly  before  the  destruction of  Septempeda  by  the  Gothic  King  Totila.

See  SS.  CARPOPHORUS,  EXANTHUS,  &c. SEVERINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  23)  
(5th  cent.)  Two  Saints  of  this  name  are honoured  on  Oct.  23.  St.  Severinus,  Bishop  of Bordeaux,  where  he  succeeded  St.  Amandus, was  a  Greek  or  Asiatic  by  birth,  and  lived  in the  first  half  of  the  fifth  century.  St.  Severinus, Bishop  of  Cologne,  was  born  at  Bordeaux and  died  there,  whence  a  certain  confusion  in the  accounts  given  of  the  two  Saints,  who moreover  were  contemporaries.  St.  Severinus of  Cologne  was  especially  noted  for  the  firmness with  which  he  withstood  the  Arian  heretics. He  died  A.D.  408. SEVERINUS  (St.)  (Nov.  1)  
(Date unknown.)  A monk or solitary of Tivoli,  near  Rome,  where  his  relics  are  venerated. No  certain  information  can  be  gathered concerning  him. SEVERINUS,  EXUPERIUS  and  FELICIAN 
(SS.)  MM.  (Nov.  19)  
(2nd cent.) Martyrs at Vienne in Gaul, under the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, about a.d.  170.  No  particulars  are  extant. SEVERINUS  (St.)  (Nov.  27)  
(Date  unknown.) A  solitary  venerated  as  a Saint  at  Paris.  No  reliable  account  of  him  has come  down  to  us. SEVERINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  21)  
(3rd  cent.) A  Bishop  of  Treves,  whose  date of  death  is  given  as  a.d.  300.  Nothing  else regarding  him  is  extant. SEVERUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  11)  

See  SS.  PETER,  SEVERUS,  &c. SEVERUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  1)  
(4th  cent.) A  native  of  Ravenna  (Italy), 
SIGISMUND 

and  Bishop  of  that  city.  He  was  greatly  loved and  venerated  by  his  flock ;  and  he  was  privileged with  many  supernatural  gifts  and graces.  He  attended  the  Council  of  Sardica (A.D.  347),  and  died  A.D.  389.  St.  Peter  Damian has  left  us  a  Sermon  in  praise  of  him. SEVERUS  (St.)  (Feb.  15)  
(6th  cent.)  A  priest  of  edifying  life  in Central  Italy,  of  whom  St.  Gregory  the  Great relates  that  by  his  prayers  he  raised  a  dead  man to  life  and  healed  a  multitude  of  sick.  His relics  were  transported  to  Germany  some centuries  after  his  holy  death,  which  happened in  the  first  half  of  the  sixth  century. SEVERUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  30)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Naples  to  whom  the working  of  many  miracles  is  attributed. SEVERUS  (St.)  (Aug.  8)  
(5th  cent.)  A  zealous  priest  who  came  from some  far-off  country  (some  say,  from  India) to  Vienne  in  Gaul,  and  there  continued  his preaching,  converting  to  Christianity  the  last of  the  Pagans  in  that  part  of  France.  His shrine  is  still  shown  at  Vienne. SEVERUS  and  MEMNON  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  20)  
(3rd  cent.)  Orientals,  officers  in  the  Imperial army,  burned  to  death  as  Christians,  with thirty-seven  other  soldiers,  in  the  neighbourhood of  Byzantium  (Constantinople)  at  the beginning  of  the  persecution  under  Diocletian, about  A.D.  290. SEVERUS  (St.)  (Oct.  1)  

Identical,  it  would  seem,  with  St.  SEVERUS (Feb.  15),  which  see. SEVERUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  15)  
(5th  cent.)  Born  in  Gaul,  he  was  a  disciple of  St.  Germanus  of  Auxerre,  and  of  St.  Lupus of  Troyes.  He  laboured  as  a  missionary  on  the borders  of  France  and  Germany,  and  became Bishop  of  Treves  (A.D.  447).  The  date  of  his death  is  not  known. SEVERUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  22)  

See  SS.  PHILIP,  SEVERUS,  &c. SEVERUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Nov.  6)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Barcelona  in  Spain who  was  put  to  death  under  Diocletian,  about A.D.  303.  Some  have  sought  to  identify  him with  another  Bishop  and  Martyr  of  the  same name  whom  they  allege  to  have  suffered  death for  the  Faith  in  the  seventh  century  at  the hands  of  the  Goths  ;  but  the  story  is  very improbable. SEVERUS, SECURUS, JANUARIUS and VIC
TORINUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  2)  
(5th cent.) African Martyrs who suffered under  the  Vandals,  about  A.D.  450. SEVERUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  30)  

See  SS.  MANSUETUS,  SEVERUS, &c. *SEXBURGA  (St.)  Widow.  (July  6)  
(7th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  King  Anna  of East  Anglia,  and  the  wife  of  King  Ercombert of  Kent.  Left  a  widow,  she  founded  the monastery  of  the  Isle  of  Sheppey,  in  Kent, at  the  place  now  called  Minster.  She  governed her  monastery  for  some  years  as  Abbess,  but  in her  old  age  retired  to  that  of  her  sister,  St. Etheldreda,  in  the  Isle  of  Ely.  Here  also,  at her  sister's  death,  Sexburga  was  chosen  Abbess, and  remained  in  that  charge  until  her  death (A.D.  699). SEXTUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  31)  

See  SS.  STEPHEN,  PONTIANUS, &c. *SEZIN  (St.)  Bp.  (March  6)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Saint  who  was  born  in  England, and  as  a  Christian  laboured  in  Ireland  in  St. Patrick's  time,  assisting  him  in  his  mission. St.  Sezin  crossed  to  Guic-Sezni  in  Brittany, where  he  founded  a  monastery,  and  where  his relics  are  still  venerated.  A.D.  529  is  usually assigned  as  the  year  of  his  death.

(4th  cent.)  Seventy-nine  Christians,  put  to death  as  such  in  Sicily,  in  the  persecution  under Diocletian,  about  A.D.  303.  

SIDONIUS  APOLLINARIS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  23)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  notable  personages of  the  Age  in  which  he  lived,  and  distinguished both  as  an  orator  and  as  a  poet.  He began  life  as  a  prominent  public  man,  was married  and  had  children.  The  Invasion  of the  Barbarians,  which  led  to  the  collapse  of the  Roman  Empire,  had  commenced ;  and Sidonius,  called  to  Rome,  was  appointed  Prefect of  the  City.  But  the  people  of  Gaul  soon reclaimed  him  and  obtained  his  recall  to  his own  country.  Separating  from  his  wife  with her  consent,  he  was  made  Bishop  of  Clermont  in Auvergne.  He  proved  himself  a  model  Bishop, not  only  by  his  zeal  for  religion,  but  also  by his  prudence  and  skill  in  safeguarding  his  flock in  the  troubles  of  the  times.  His  dealings  with Alaric,  the  chief  of  the  Goths,  though  they irritated  the  Barbarians,  ultimately  resulted  in the  escape  of  his  people  from  destruction. St.  Sidonius  died  in  A.D.  482,  and  has  left  many letters  and  poems.  Like  so  many  of  his  contemporaries, he  could  not  bring  himself  to  believe that  the  Roman  Empire  was  to  pass  away  and to  be  succeeded  by  a  new  Europe,  peopled  by conflicting  nations.  This  makes  his  correspondence specially  interesting.  

SIDRONIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Martyr  of  this  name  suffered in  Rome  under  the  Emperor  Aurelian  (a.d.  270 about).  His  relics  were  in  the  Middle  Ages translated  into  Flanders.  Another  St.  Sidronius is  venerated  at  Sens  in  France.  The  history  of the  one  and  of  the  other  is  confused,  and  the particulars  drawn  from  tradition  are  unreliable.  

♦SIDWELL  (St.)  V.M.  (Aug.  1)  
(Date  uncertain.)  Probably  of  British  (not Anglo-Saxon)  lineage.  She  is  said  to  have  lived in  the  West  of  England  ;  and  there  are  churches dedicated  to  her  in  Devonshire,  chiefly  in  the neighbourhood  of  Exeter.  But  particulars  of her  life,  and  especially  as  to  how  it  came  about that  she  was  venerated  as  a  Martyr,  are  lacking.  

♦SIGEBERT  (St.)  King,  M.  (Jan.  25)  
(7th  cent.)  The  First  Christian  King  of East  Anglia.  Seconded  by  St.  Felix,  who founded  the  See  of  Dunwich,  and  by  St.  Fursey, he  induced  his  subjects  to  embrace  Christianity. He  had  retired  into  a  monastery  ;  but,  when  the fierce  Penda  of  Mercia  threatened  the  East Anglians  with  Are  and  sword,  his  people recalled  Sigebert.  He  fell  in  battle  (A.D.  635) and,  as  he  was  fighting  against  Pagans,  acquired the  title  and  honours  of  a  Martyr.  

♦SIGFRID  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  15)  
(11th  cent.)  An  English  missionary  in Sweden  and  Norway,  favoured  by  the  Christian King  Olaf  of  Norway.  He  was  the  instrument chosen  by  Divine  Providence  for  the  conversion of  the  similarly  named  King  Olaf  of  Sweden. St.  Sigfrid,  made  Bishop  of  Wexiow,  at  length rested  from  his  long  life  of  toil,  and  his  remains were  enshrined  in  his  Cathedral.  Some  writers say  that  he  was  canonised  by  Pope  Hadrian IV  ;  but  his  name  does  not  occur  in  the  Roman Martyrology.  

♦SIGFRID  (St.)  Abbot.  (Aug.  22)  
(7th  cent.)  A  friend  and  disciple  of  St. Benedict  Biscop,  who  committed  to  him  the government  of  the  Abbey  of  Wea-mouth.  The two  Saints  died  in  the  same  yeai  '\.d.  688), and  in  after  times  their  relics,  with  those  of St.  Easterwine,  the  predecessor  of  St.  Sigfrid, were  placed  in  one  shrine.

SIGISMUND  (St.)  King,  M.  (May  1)  
(6th  cent.)  A  King  of  Burgundy,  one  of  the

SILAS 
Principalities  into  which  France  was  divided after  the  break-up  of  the  Roman  Empire. He  reigned  but  one  year,  during  which  he,  on account  of  an  unfounded  charge  against  him, allowed  or  ordered  his  son  to  be  put  to  death. Struck  by  remorse,  he  founded  the  monastery of  Agaune,  in  memory  of  the  Martyrs  of  the Theban  Legion,  and  retired  there  to  do  lifelong penance  ;  but  was  seized  by  a  rival  chieftain and  put  to  death  (a.d.  524).  He  is  honoured as  a  Martyr  ;  and  his  shrine  is  at  Prague  in Bohemia.  

SILAS  (St.)  (July  13)  
(1st  cent.)  The  disciple  and  companion  of St.  Paul,  of  whom  we  read  in  the  Acts  of  the Apostles  (xv.-xviii.).  His  name  is  spelled Silvanus  in  the  Epistles  (1  and  2  Thess.),  both written  from  Corinth.  Tradition  adds  that St.  Silas  remained  in  Europe  and  died  in Macedonia.  

♦SILAUS  (SILAVE,  SILANUS)  (St.)  P.p.  (May  17) (11th  cent.)  A  holy  Irish  Bishop  who, returning  from  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome,  died  at Lucca  in  Tuscany  (A.D.  1100).  The  many miracles  wrought  at  his  tomb  led  to  his  being locally  venerated  as  a  Saint.  

♦SILIN  (SULIAN)  (St.)  (Sept.  1)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Prince  of  North  Wales,  who, in  the  sixth  century,  after  living  for  some  years as  a  hermit  in  an  island  off  the  coast  of  Anglesey, passed  over  into  Brittany  and,  gathering  many fellow-workers  around  him,  laboured  at  the conversion  of  the  heathen  still  remaining  in  that country.  

♦SILLAN  (SILVAN,  SYLVAN)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  28) (7th  cent.)  He  was  the  third  successor  of St.  Comgall  in  the  monastery  of  Bangor,  and bore  great  reputation  for  sanctity.  A.D.  606 and  A.D.  610  are  the  years  assigned  by  the various  writers  for  his  departure  from  this world.  

SILVANUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  6)  
(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  in  Phenicia  in  the persecution  under  Diocletian  and  Maximian. St.  Silvanus  with  two  other  Christians  was thrown  into  the  Amphitheatre  and  torn  in pieces  by  wild  beasts  (A.D.  #06).  

SILVANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  10)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Saint,  probably  Bishop of  Terracina,  between  Naples  and  Rome,  commemorated in  the  Martyrology  of  St.  Jerome and  other  records.  He  is  described  as  a "  Confessor,"  which  would  mean  that  he  was  a Martyr  or  at  least  had  suffered  greatly  for  the Faith.  Nothing  more  is  known  of  him.

(4th  cent.)  Egyptian  and  Palestinian  Christians put  to  death  (A.D.  311)  under  the  Emperor Galerius  in  Palestine.  The  account  of  their martyrdom  is  given  by  Eusebius,  who  places first  among  them  St.  Silvanus,  Bishop  of  Gaza. The  tortures  to  which  they  were  put  were frightful  and  terribly  varied.  The  total  number of  victims  is  not  given  ;  but  Eusebius,  an  eyewitness, tells  us  that  in  a  single  day  thirty-nine perished.  

SILVANUS  (St.)  M.  (May  5)

See  SS.  DOMNINUS,  THEOTIMUS, &c.  

SILVANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  2)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Troas  in  Phrygia (Asia  Minor),  who  had  previously  been  a  monk at  Constantinople.  He  seems  to  have  been  a prelate,  distinguished,  not  only  for  piety  and zeal,  but  also  for  skill  and  forethought.  A useful  reform  he  made  was  that  of  prohibiting his  clergy  from  acting  as  Judges  in  Law  Courts. The  historian  Socrates,  from  whom  we  have  the above,  narrates  a  striking  miracle  worked  in public  by  the  Saint.  The  latter  lived  till  after A.D.  450.  

SILVERIUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (June  20)  
(6th  cent.)  The  successor  (A.D.  536)  of  Pope St.  Agapetus.  During  his  short  reign  of  two years,  the  Emperor  Justinian  of  Constantinople recovered  Rome  and  the  greater  part  of  Italy by  breaking  the  power  of  the  Ostro-Goths. St.  Silverius  firmly  withstood  the  interference in  religious  matters  of  the  Empress  Theodora  ; but  was  on  that  account  persecuted  by  her  to exile  and  death.  After  having  been  taken  to Constantinople,  he  was  banished  to  an  island off  the  coast  of  Italy,  where  he  died  (a.d.  538). He  was  succeeded  by  Vigilius,  till  then  an Anti-Pope.  

SILVESTER  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  20)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Chalon-sur-Saone (France),  who  ruled  over  that  See  for  forty years,  and  was  venerated  throughout  France for  his  virtues  and  for  his  gift  of  working miracles.  Of  some  of  these  St.  Gregory  of Tours  gives  an  account.  St.  Silvester  died about  A.D.  532.  

SILVESTER  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  26)  
(13th  cent.)  The  Founder  of  the  Silvestrine Congregation  of  Benedictine  monks,  at  Fabriano in  Central  Italy.  To  effect  this,  he  gave  up  a brilliant  ecclesiastical  career,  incited  thereto by  the  sight  of  the  decaying  dead  body  of  one of  his  kinsmen,  like  himself,  of  noble  birth, and  in  life  looked  up  to  by  all.  Having  overcome many  difficulties,  he  firmly  established his  institute,  which  has  lasted  to  our  own  time. St.  Silvester  passed  away  at  the  age  of  ninety (A.D.  1267).  

SILVESTER  (St.)  Pope.  (Dec.  31)  
(4thcent.)  ThesuccessorofPope St.Melchiades (A.D.  314).  He  governed  the  Church  during twenty  and  more  eventful  years,  marked  by  the cessation  of  the  age-long  persecutions  under the  Pagan  Roman  Emperors,  by  the  conversion of  the  Emperor  Constantine  and  by  the  celebration of  the  great  Council  of  Nicsea  (A.D.  325) against  the  Arian  heretics.  He  ably  organised the  discipline  of  the  Roman  Church,  happily  no longer  imprisoned  in  the  Catacombs  in  one  of which,  however,  his  own  body  remained  interred for  several  centuries  after  his  death  (A.D.  335).  

SILVINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  17)  
(7th  cent.)  He  is  said  by  some  to  have  been at  one  time  Bishop  of  Toulouse  ;  but  it  is certain  that  he  came  to  the  North  of  France about  A.D.  674,  and  acted  as  Bishop  of  Terouanne  over  the  country  round  St.  Omer.  It  is recorded  of  him  that  he  spent  his  whole  fortune in  ransoming  the  Christians  carried  off  into slavery  in  their  inroads  by  the  neighbouring Barbarian  tribes.  

SILVINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept,  12)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Bishop  of  Verona (Italy),  honoured  as  a  Saint  en  account  of  his life  of  prayer  and  penance,  and  of  his  devotedness  in  watching  over  the  interests,  spiritual and  temporal,  of  his  flock.  

SILVINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  28)  
(5th  cent.) A  Bishop  of  Brescia  in  Lom
bardy,  raised  to  that  dignity  in  his  extreme 
SIMPLICIUS 

old  age,  when  he  had  already  earned  a  reputation of  the  highest  sanctity. SILVIUS  (St.)  M.  (April  21)  

See  88.  ABATOR,  FORTUNATUS, &c. SIMEON  STYLITES  (St.)  (Jan.  5)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Syrian  Saint,  whose  extraordinary life  of  penance  led  on  the  summit  of a  pillar  has  earned  him  world-wide  celebrity, together  with  the  name  "  Stylites."  The  son of  poor  parents,  he  in  early  life  retired  into  a monastery.  It  was  at  the  age  of  thirty-two that  he  adopted  his  characteristic  fashion  of sanctifying  his  soul  by  doing  penance  and praying  on  the  top  of  a  lofty  stone  column. In  it  he  persevered  for  thirty-seven  years  until his  death  (A.D.  459).  From  time  to  time,  he increased  the  height  of  his  pillar.  The  last, on  which  he  had  lived  for  twenty  years  when he  died,  was  forty  cubits  (say,  sixty  feet)  high. The  flat  summit  was  about  three  feet  in  diameter. He  could  stand,  kneel  or  sit,  but  never lie  down.  Similarly,  his  fastings  pass  belief, as,  for  instance,  his  remaining  the  whole  of Lent  without  taking  any  food  at  all.  His  pillar stood  on  a  hill  on  the  boundary  of  Syria  and Cilicia,  and  crowds  of  people  thronged  daily the  enclosure  in  which  it  was  erected,  in  order to  ask  the  prayers  of  the  Saint  and  to  listen to  his  sermons.  His  whole  life  was  in  a  sense a  miracle  and  the  wonder  of  the  century  in which  he  lived  ;  nor,  had  we  not  the  testimony of  Theodoret  the  historian,  and  of  other  contemporary writers,  could  we  accept  as  facts what  is  narrated  of  him. SIMEON  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Feb.  18)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  son  of  Cleophas  and  a kinsman  of  Our  Blessed  Lord.  He  was  one  of those  present  on  the  Day  of  Pentecost,  and, after  the  death  of  the  Apostle  St.  James  the Less,  became  Bishop  of  Jerusalem.  He governed  that  Church  for  over  forty  years,  revered by  Jews  and  Pagans,  as  by  Christians. When  over  one  hundred  years  of  age,  he  met his  death,  being  crucified  in  the  reign  of  the Emperor  Trajan,  about  A.D.  112. SIMEON  (St.)  M.  (March  24)  
(15th  cent.)  A  child  at  Trent  in  the  North of  Italy,  described  as  having  been  murdered at  Eastertide  (A.D.  1475)  by  Jews,  out  of  hatred of  the  Christian  religion.  There  is  much  of evidence  to  support  some  at  least  of  these accusations  of  crimes  of  superstitious  zeal brought  against  the  Jews  throughout  Europe during  the  later  Middle  Ages.

(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  under  the  Persian monarch,  Sapor  II.  Simeon  and  four  others were  Bishops  ;  the  rest,  about  one  hundred  in number,  mostly  laymen.  They  were  beheaded in  Mesopotamia  A.D.  341.  Their  remains, with  those  of  many  other  victims  of  the  same persecution,  were  collected  and  honourably buried  by  St.  Maruthas. SIMEON  (St.)  (June  1)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Greek  monk  who  came  from Sicily  to  Treves  and  there  lived  the  life  of  a Recluse,  enclosed  in  a  narrow  and  bricked-up cell,  in  which  he  died  A.D.  1035.  Many  miracles bore  witness  to  his  sanctity. SIMEON  SALUS  (St.)  (July  1)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Saint  who,  in  order to  court  derision  and  ill-treatment,  affected the  manners  and  way  of  speaking  of  idiots, and  thereby  earned  for  himself  the  surname Salus,  which  signifies  a  fool.  For  nearly thirty  years  he  lived  as  a  hermit  in  a  desert near  the  Red  Sea,  but  afterwards  at  Emesus in  Syria.  He  was  still  alive  when  that  city was  destroyed  by  an  earthquake  (A.D.  588) ; but  the  vear  of  his  death  is  unknown. SIMEON  (St.)  (July  26)  
(10th  cent.) An  Armenian  monk  who, 

having  lived  for  some  years  as  a  Solitary  in Palestine,  made  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome,  and  in the  return  journey  entered  the  Benedictine monastery  of  Mantua,  where  he  died  a  holy death  (A.D.  1016).  Many  miracles  wrought at  his  tomb  led  to  his  canonisation  about  fifty years  later.  

SIMEON  STYLITES  THE  YOUNGER  (St.)  (Sept.  3) (6th  cent.)  A  Syrian  monk  who,  about  one hundred  years  after  the  great  Pillar  Saint,  St. Simeon,  and  in  the  same  neighbourhood,  did penance  for  sixty  years  on  a  similar  pillar,  and became  almost  equally  famous.  The  Emperor Maurice  of  Constantinople  held  him  in  great veneration.  

SIMEON  SENEX  (St.)  (Oct.  8)  
(1st  cent.)  "  The  just  and  devout  man, waiting  for  the  consolation  of  Israel,"  who  in the  Temple  took  the  Infant  Saviour  in  his  arms, and,  inspired  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  blessed  God with  the  Nunc  dimittis  (Luke  ii.  25-35).  Tradition has  preserved  nothing  more  regarding  him  ; but  he  has  always  had  in  the  Church  a  place in  her  Catalogues  of  Saints.  

SIMILIANUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  16)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Nantes  (France), early  in  the  fourth  century.  He  died  a.d.  310. His  Acts  have  long  since  been  lost ;  but  St. Gregory  of  Tours  testifies  to  his  sanctity  and  to the  honour  in  which  his  memory  was  always held.  

SIMITRIUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  26) (2nd  cent.)  Roman  Martyrs,  twenty-three in  number,  beheaded  as  Christians,  and without  trial,  as  having  been  arrested  while assembled  for  prayer  in  the  Title  or  Church  of St.  Praxedes  (a.d.  159,  about).  

SIMON  STOCK  (St.)  (May  16)  
(13th  cent.)  Born  at  Aylesford  in  Kent. After  dwelling  as  a  hermit  in  the  hollow  trunk of  a  tree  (Stock),  he  joined  the  Carmelite  Order, of  which  he  became  General,  organising  its Constitutions  and  illustrating  it  by  his  piety and  learning.  It  was  to  him  that  Our  Blessed Lady  presented  the  Brown  Scapular  and  gave the  promise  of  her  special  protection  to  all who  should  wear  it.  St.  Simon  died  at  Bordeaux in  France,  A.D.  1265.  

♦SIMON  of  LIPNICA  (St.)  (July  18)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Polish  Saint  of  the  Order  of 
St.  Francis,  remarkable  for  the  austerity  of  his 
life, who passed away at Cracow, July 18, 
A.D.  1482.  

SIMON  (St.)  Apostle.  (Oct.  28)  
(1st  cent.)  In  the  New  Testament  he  is surnamed  the  Chanansean  (of  Cana  of  Galilee), and  also  Zelotes  (the  Zealot).  Both  Greeks  and Latins  hold  that  after  the  Ascension  he  preached the  Gospel  in  Egypt  and  in  North  Africa. He  is  generally  believed  to  have  passed  thence into  Mesopotamia  and  Persia,  in  which  latter country  he  laid  down  his  life  for  Christ.  

♦SIMPERT  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  13)  
(9th  cent.)  A  monk  of  an  Abbey  near  Colmar

SIMPLICIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Ambrose  in the  Archbishopric  of  Milan.  Both  St.  Ambrose and  St.  Augustine  look  up  to  him  as  to  a  father, and  the  latter  used  to  send  works  of  his  own  to Simplician  for  correction.  His  name  is  often mentioned  in  the  Ecclesiastical  History  of  the last  half  of  the  fourth  century.  He  was  very old  when  he  became  Bishop,  and  held  his  See for  only  three  years,  dying  a.d.  400.

Married  while still  a  layman,  he  and  his  wife  afterwards  lived together  as  brother  and  sister  till  his  death about  a.d.  360. SIMPLICIUS,  FORTUNATUS  and  BEATRIX

SIRMIUM  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (Feb.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  At  Sirmium,  capital  of  the Roman  Province  of  Pannonia,  seventy-three Christians  perished  about  a.d.  303  in  the persecution  under  Diocletian,  and  are  honoured as  Martyrs. SISENANDUS  (St.)  M.  (July  16)  
(9th  cent.)  Born  in  Portugal,  he  became  a cleric  of  the  Church  of  Cordova.  He  foresaw his  own  martyrdom,  which  came  to  pass  at  the hands  of  the  Moors  about  A.D.  851. SISINIUS, MARTYRIUS and ALEXANDER 
(SS.)  MM.  (May  29)  
(4th  cent.)  Eastern  Christians  from  Cappadocia  (Asia  Minor),  received  by  St.  Ambrose and  sent  as  missionaries  into  the  Alpine  districts. There  they  met  with  their  death  at the  hands  of  the  Pagans  (a.d.  397).  There  is extant  a  letter  to  St.  Simplician,  successor of  St.  Ambrose  at  Milan,  from  St.  Vigilius, Bishop  of  Trent  at  the  time.  It  gives  a pathetic  account  of  the  sufferings  of  these Martyrs. SISINIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  23)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  (A.D.  311)  in  the  great 
persecution  at  Cyzicus  on  the  shores  of  the 
Hellespont.  He  is  in  special  veneration  among 
the  Greeks.  

SISINIUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  29)  

See  SS.  SATURNINUS  and  SISINIUS. SISINNIUS,  DIOCLETIUS  and  FLORENTIUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (May  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Osimo  near  Ancona (Italy)  in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian. They  were  stoned  to  death  at  the  same  time as  the  better-known  Martyr  St.  Anthimus  in the  last  years  of  the  third  century. *SISOES  (St.)  Hermit.  (July  4)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Anchoret  in  Egypt,  where  he succeeded  to  some  extent  to  the  influence possessed  by  St.  Antony.  He  died  about  a.d. 429,  having  passed  sixty-two  years  in  the wilderness. *SITHIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (June  15)  

Otherwise  St.  SEDUINUS  (possibly  identical with  St.  Swithun). SIVIARDUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  1)  
(7th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  Abbot  of  a monastery  in  the  Province  of  Maine.  He  is best  known  as  having  written  the  Life  of St.  Calais,  Founder  of  his  Abbey.  A.D.  728  is given  as  the  date  of  his  death.  His  own  life by  a  contemporary,  published  by  Surius,  gives some  particulars  about  him. SIXTUS  (St.)  

Otherwise  St.  XYSTUS,  which  see. *SLEBHENE  (SLEBHINE)  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  2)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who,  migrating  to Iona,  was  elected  fifteenth  Abbot  of  that monastery.  During  his  time  the  "  Lex  Colombkille  ' '  was  enforced  in  Ireland  by  King  Domnhall.  St.  Slebhene  died  a.d.  754. SMARAGDUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  8)

See  SS.  CANTIDIUS,  CANTIDIANUS, &c. SOCRATES  and  DIONYSIUS  (SS.)  MM. (April  19)  
(3rd  cent.)  Martyrs  in  Pamphylia  (Asia Minor)  under  the  Emperor  Aurelian  (A.D.  270a.d.  275).  They  are  stated  as  having  been stabbed  to  death,  which  points  to  their  having perished  from  the  fury  of  a  mob,  rather  than to  a  regular  execution  after  trial. SOCRATES  and  STEPHEN  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  1)  
(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  said  to  have  suffered  in Great  Britain  during  the  persecution  under Diocletian.  With  St.  Alban  and  SS.  Julius  and Aaron,  they  are  the  only  victims  registered  in the  Martyrologies  as  British.  It  is  well  known that  the  Caesar  Constantius  Chlorus,  who  then ruled  with  Imperial  powers  in  the  West,  declined to  carry  out  the  edict  of  persecution  in  all  its rigour.  Hence,  to  a  great  extent,  the  British Christians were spared.  Tradition puts the 
SPES 

scene  of  the  martyrdom  of  SS.  Socrates  and Stephen  in  South  Wales.  But  this  is  very uncertain.  

SOLA  (SOLUS)  (St.)  (Dec.  3)  
(8th  cent.)  A  missionary  with  St.  Boniface from  England  to  Germany,  where  he  ended  his life  as  a  hermit  in  Bavaria  (a.d.  790).  The chroniclers  say  of  him  that  "  he  was  venerated as  a  Saint  by  noble  and  simple  alike." 
♦SOLANGE  (St.)  V.M.  (May  10)  
(9th  cent.)  A  poor  shepherdess  of  the neighbourhood  of  Bourges  in  France.  Always held  in  great  respect  on  account  of  her  piety and  virtuous  life,  she  elected  rather  to  die  than to  consent  to  sin.  In  his  rage  at  her  constancy the  young  lord  of  the  district,  who  was  tempting her,  brutally  murdered  her  (a.d.  844).  

SOLEMNIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  25)  
(7th  cent.) A  Bishop  of  Chartres,  famous  for 
miracles.  St.  Gregory  of  Tours  and  other  old 
writers  make  mention  of  him.  A.D.  602  is  the 
probable  date  of  his  death.  

♦SOLINA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  17)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  put  to  death at  Chartres  in  France  for  refusing  to  renounce her  Faith  in  Christ.  It  is  uncertain  in  which of  the  third  century  persecutions  her  martyrdom took  place.  

SOLOCHANUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  17) (3rd  cent.)  Egyptian  Martyrs,  soldiers  in the  Imperial  army,  who  were  put  to  death  at Chalcedon  near  Constantinople  in  the  persecution under  Diocletian,  towards  the  end  of  the third  century.  The  Greek  traditions  enlarge upon  the  many  and  various  kinds  of  torture to  which  they  were  subjected.

SOPHIA  (St.)  V.M.  (April  30)  
(3rd cent.) A Christian maiden who laid 
down  her  life  for  Christ  at  Fermo  in  Central 
Italy,  probably  during  the  persecution  under 
Decius  (A.D.  250).  

SOPHIA  and  IRENE  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  18)  
(Date  unknown.)  Save  for  the  entry  in  the Martyrologies,  no  memory  has  remained  of  these Saints.  

SOPHIA  (St.)  Widow.  (Sept.  30)  
(2nd  cent.)  The  mother  of  the  VirginSaints,  Faith,  Hope  and  Charity,  who,  as tradition  has  handed  down  to  us,  suffered  death for  Christ  under  the  Emperor  Hadrian  (A.D. 117-138),  while  still  children.  Three  days later,  their  mother,  while  praying  over  their tomb,  herself  passed  away  in  peace.  This St.  Sophia,  though  the  object  of  much  popular devotion  in  the  East,  must  not  be  thought  to be  the  Title  Saint  of  the  world-famed  Basilica of  St.  Sophia  at  Constantinople.  That  Church is  dedicated  to  the  Divine  Wisdom  or  Holy Wisdom,  which  in  Greek  is  equivalent  to  our Sancta  Sophia.  

SOPHONIAS  (St.)  Prophet.  (Dec.  3)  
(7th  cent.  B.C.)  Sophonias  (Zephaniah), who  is  said  to  have  been  of  the  Tribe  of  Simeon, prophecied  in  Juda  in  the  days  of  King  Josias. He  foretold  the  judgments  of  God  upon  Jerusalem ;  but  also  the  ultimate  conversion  of  the Jews.  There  are  no  reliable  traditions  regarding him ;  and  Holy  Scripture  is  silent  on  the subject.  

SOPHRONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  11)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Syrian  Saint  from  Damascus, the  friend  of  St.  John  the  Almoner  of  Alexandria. Elected  Patriarch  of  Jerusalem  (a.d. 033),  he  showed  himself  a  zealous  and  selfsacrificing  Pastor  of  souls.  He  revised  the Mencea  or  Eastern  Martyrology,  and  has  left 

us  several  works  of  his  own  composition.  His last  Christmas  sermon,  preached  when  the Mohammedans  had  already  laid  siege  to  Jerusalem, and  the  Christians  could  not,  according to  custom,  go  out  to  keep  the  festival  at  Bethlehem, is  very  touching.  He  died  a.d.  637,  of grief,  shortly  after  the  Holy  City  had  been taken  and  devastated  by  the  infidels.  

SOPHRONIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  8)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Bishop  in  Cyprus,  much venerated  by  the  Greeks.  He  is  chiefly  renowned for  his  charity  to  the  poor  and  for his  anxious  guardianship  of  the  widows  and orphans  of  his  flock.  

SOSIPATER  (St.)  (June  25)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  kinsman  and  disciple  of  St. Paul  (Rom.  xvi.  21).  He  accompanied  the Apostle  on  some  of  his  journeys,  and  tradition connects  his  later  life  with  the  island  of  Corfu. He  is  other  than  the  Sopater  of  Acts  xx.,  who was  of  Bercea  and  a  disciple  and  companion of  the  same  Apostle.  

SOSIUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  19)  

See  SS.  JANUARIUS,  FESTUS, &c.  

SOSTHENES  and  VICTOR  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  10) (4th  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Chalcedon,  opposite Constantinople  (a.d.  307),  in  the  persecution under  Diocletian.  They  were  among  the executioners  appointed  to  torture  St.  Euphemia ; but  through  her  prayers  were  converted  to Christianity  and  preceded  her  to  martyrdom.  

SOSTHENES  (St.)  (Nov.  28)  
(1st  cent.)  The  ruler  of  the  synagogue  of Corinth  (Acts  xviii.  17),  who  became  a  disciple of  St.  Paul,  and  is  probably  the  "brother" mentioned  in  1  Cor.  i.  1.  Some  say  that Sosthenes  was  afterwards  made  a  Bishop,  and that  he  ended  his  life  by  martyrdom.  

SOSTINEUS  SOSTINEI  (St.)  (May  3)  

One  of  the  SEVEN  FOUNDERS  OF  THE SERVITE  ORDER,  which  see.  

SOTER  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (April  22)  
(2nd  cent.)  An  Italian  by  birth,  the  successor of  Pope  St.  Anicetus.  He  lived  in  the time  of  the  Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius.  He  was distinguished  for  charity  to  the  poor  and  for watchfulness  over  the  Churches,  just  then threatened  by  the  rising  heresy  of  Montanus. There  is  a  dispute  about  the  exact  date  of  his death,  which  took  place  between  A.d.  170  and A.d.  182.  He  is  venerated  as  a  Martyr.  

SOTERES  (St.)  V.M.  (Feb.  10)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  maiden  in  Rome, put  to  death  after  torture  in  the  persecution under  Diocletian  (a.d.  304).  St.  Ambrose  more than  once  puts  Soteres  forward  as  an  example to  them  in  his  preaching  to  the  virgins  of  Milan.  

SOZON  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  7)  
(4th  cent.) A  Christian  in  Cilicia  who  broke 
up  a  silver  idol  and  gave  the  proceeds  to  the 
poor.  He  was  burned  to  death  at  the  stake 
(a.d.  304,  about).  

SPECIOSUS  (St.)  (March  15)  
(6th  cent.)  One  of  the  first  Benedictine monks  and  Founder  of  the  monastery  of  the Order  at  Terracina,  between  Rome  and  Naples, on  the  Mediterranean  coast  of  Italy.  St. Gregory  the  Great  tells  of  his  holy  life  and  of the  wonders  wrought  by  Almighty  God  at  the moment  of  his  death,  in  witness  to  his  sanctity.  

♦SPERANDIA  (St.)  V.  (Sept.  11)  
(13th  cent.)  A  relative  of  St.  Ubaldus  of Gubbio,  who  became  the  Abbess  of  a  Benedictine monastery  in  Italy,  a.d.  1276  is  given as  the  date  of  her  death.  

SPERATUS  (St.)  M.  (July  17)  

See  SCILLITAN  MARTYRS.  

SPES  (St.)  Abbot.  (March  28)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  man  of  whom  St.  Gregory the  Great  relates  that  for  forty  years  he  was totally  blind,  and  that  on  recovering  his  sight he  laboured  for  another  fifteen  years  in  the monasteries  of  Central  Italy.  He  was  a famous  preacher.  He  had  founded  an  Abbey

See  SS.  FAITH,  HOPE  and  CHARITY.  

SPEUSIPPUS,  ELEUSIPPUS,  MELEUSIPPUS  and LEONILLA  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  17)  
(2nd  cent.)  Three  brothers,  said  to  have been  born  at  one  birth.  They  were  natives  of Cappadocia  (Asia  Minor)  and,  with  their  aged grandmother,  Leonilla,  were  put  to  death  as Christians  under  the  Emperor  Marcus  Aurelius, about  a.d.  175.  Their  relics  were  many centuries  later  brought  to  Langres  in  France, where  their  church  bears  the  name  of  St.  Oeome (Holy  Twins).  

SPIRIDION  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  14)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  in  the  Island  of Cyprus,  of  which  he  was  a  native.  In  the persecution  under  Diocletian's  colleague,  Galerius,  he,  with  many  other  Christians,  was condemned  to  lose  an  eye,  and  to  servitude  in the  mines.  After  the  peace  of  the  Church he  assisted  at  various  Councils,  and  we  hear  of him  as  late  as  a.d.  347.  He  is  in  great  veneration in  the  East.  

STACHIS  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  31)  
(1st  cent.)  The  Christian  saluted  by  St. Paul  (Bom.  xvi.  9)  as  "my  beloved  one." The  tradition  is  that  St.  Andrew  consecrated him  First  Bishop  of  Byzantium  (Constantinople) and  that  he  laboured  there  and  in  the  surrounding parts  of  Thrace  until  his  death,  about sixteen  years  afterwards.  

STACTEUS  (St.)  M.  (July  18)  

See  SEVEN  HOLY  BROTHERS.  

STACTEUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  28)  
(Date unknown.) The old Martyrologies 
describe  this  St. Stacteus  as  having  suffered 
martyrdom  in  Rome  ; but  we  have  no  further 
record  of  him.  

STANISLAUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (May  7)  
(11th  cent.)  One  of  the  most  famous  of Polish  Saints.  Born  near  Cracow  (a.d.  1030), and  educated  partly  in  Poland  and  partly  at Paris,  he  became  (a.d.  1071)  Archbishop  of Cracow.  His  pastoral  zeal  had  won  for  him the  love  and  esteem  of  his  flock  when  it  fell to  him  to  rebuke  and  at  last  to  excommunicate the  able  and  powerful  King  Boleslaus  II,  who was  leading  an  evil  life.  To  revenge  himself, the  King,  on  the  refusal  of  his  guards  to  do  so, killed  the  holy  man  with  his  own  hand  in  a church  near  Cracow  (a.d.  1079).  Boleslaus, after  this,  detested  by  his  subjects,  fled  the country  and  died  miserably  ;  while  St.  Stanislaus was  at  once  recognised  as  a  Saint  and  a Martyr  by  the  whole  Polish  nation.  His  formal canonisation  took  place  in  A.D.  1253.  

STANISLAUS  KOSTKA  (St.)  (Aug.  15)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Polish  Saint  who  died  in Rome,  being  then  a  novice  in  the  Society  of Jesus  (Aug.  15,  A.D.  1568),  at  the  age  of  eighteen. During  his  short  life  he  had  had  to  suffer persecution  both  from  his  own  kinsmen  and from  the  Lutherans,  with  whom  they  were connected.  Burning  with  love  of  God  and devoted  to  Our  Blessed  Lady,  Stanislaus achieved  his  object  of  entering  the  Society  of Jesus,  at  the  cost  of  journeying  on  foot  from Poland  to  Rome,  where  he  was  welcomed  by St.  Francis  Borgia.  Many  were  the  supernatural favours  bestowed  upon  the  innocent  youth  by Almighty  God,  and  universal  has  become  the veneration  in  which  he  is  held  throughout  the Catholic  world.  

STEPHEN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  8)  
(12th  cent.)  A  French  Saint,  Founder  of  the Religious  Order  called  of  Grandimount,  from the  place  in  Auvergne  where  its  first  house  was established.  The  life  of  these  monks,  over whom  St.  Stephen  presided  for  fifty  years,  was that  of  hermits  devoted  to  prayer  and  penitential exercises,  after  the  manner  of  some  then flourishing  in  Southern  Italy,  whom  St.  Stephen 248 

had  visited.  He  died  a.d.  1126  at  the  age  of seventy,  and  many  miracles  wrought  at  his tomb  bore  witness  to  his  sanctity.  

STEPHEN  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  13)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Lyons  in  France, venerated  from  ancient  times  as  a  Saint ;  but we  have  no  record  of  him  beyond  praises  of  him in  the  letters  of  St.  Ennodius  of  Pavia  and St.  Avitus  of  Vienne,  his  contemporaries.  

STEPHEN  (St.)  Abbot.  (Feb.  13)  
(6th  cent.)  A  holy  monk  and  Abbot  of  Rieti (Central  Italy),  in  whose  praise  St.  Gregory  the Great  wrote  more  than  once,  enlarging  on  his patience  and  spirit  of  detachment  from  the things  of  this  world.  

STEPHEN  (St.)  M.  (April  1)  

See  SS.  VICTOR  and  STEPHEN.  

STEPHEN  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  17)  
(12th  cent.)  Stephen  Harding,  an  Englishman from  Dorsetshire,  was  one  of  the  Founders of  the  Cistercian  Order,  and  the  first  to  draw up  the  Rule  of  that  Institute.  In  his  lifetime he  saw  the  rise  of  above  a  hundred  monasteries branching  from  its  Mother  House  at  Citeaux in  Burgundy.  The  principle  of  the  monastic life  of  these  Religious  is  the  observance  to  the letter  of  the  ancient  Rule  of  St.  Benedict, variously  interpreted  in  other  monasteries  of the  Order.  St.  Stephen  died  A.D.  1134.  

STEPHEN  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (April  25)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Patriarch  of  Antioch,  victim 
of  the  implacable  hostility  of  the  Eutychian 
heretics,  who  in  the  end  flung  him  into  the 
River  Orontes  and  so  caused  his  death  (A.D.  481).  

STEPHEN  (St.)  M.  (April  27)  

See  SS.  CASTOR  and  STEPHEN.  

STEPHEN  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Aug.  2)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman,  successor  of  Pope  St. Lucius  (A.D.  253),  who  was  much  occupied  during his  troubled  Pontificate  with  the  ecclesiastical affairs  of  Gaul,  Spain  and  Africa.  It  was  with him  that  St.  Cyprian,  the  great  African  Father of  the  Church  and  Martyr,  fell  into  a  disagreement with  regard  to  the  rebaptising  of  heretics, though  of  course  the  Papal  decision  in  the  end prevailed.  He  died  A.D.  257.  Tradition  alleges that  he  was  beheaded  while  seated  in  his  chair before  the  Altar  in  the  Catacombs.

See  SS.  XYSTUS,  FELICISSIMUS, &c.  

STEPHEN  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  9)  
(9th  cent.)  St.  Stephen  was  the  Abbot  of  a Benedictine  monastery  at  Burgos  in  Spain. He  with  his  community  of  two  hundred  monks was  put  to  the  sword  in  their  own  cloisters  by a  horde  of  Mohammedan  Arabs  (a.d.  872).  

STEPHEN  (St.)  King.  (Sept.  2)  
(11th  cent.)  The  Apostle  and  first  Christian King  of  Hungary.  On  the  death  of  his  father Geysa  (A.D.  977),  he  succeeded  him  as  Voivoda of  the  Hungarians  and  proved  himself  an  able and  strenuous  rider.  Victorious  in  many  wars, he  was  zealous  not  only  for  the  temporal  good of  his  people  (to  whom  he  gave  an  excellent Code  of  Laws)  but  above  all  for  their  conversion from  the  worship  of  idols  to  the  Christian religion.  In  this  he  was  so  successful  that Pope  Sylvester  II  bestowed  on  him  the  title of  "Apostolic  King"— a  title  retained  by  his successors.  He  founded  many  Bishoprics  and thoroughly  organised  the  Church  and  State  of Hungary,  which  country  he  dedicated  to  Our Blessed  Lady.  He  died  Aug.  15,  a.d.  1038, and  was  at  once  acclaimed  as  a  Saint.

(8th  cent.) Three  hundred  and  forty-three 
Catholic  Christians,  victims  of  the  fury  of  the 
SWITHBERT 

Iconoclast  Emperor  Constantine  Copronymus. The  Greek  Catalogues  describe  them  as  monks. They  suffered  death  in  various  ways  in  the neighbourhood  of  Constantinople  (a.d.  700). St.  Stephen  (styled  "the  Younger")  seems  to have  been  their  leader  and  chief  spokesman. STEPHEN  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  3)  

See  SS.  CLAUDIUS,  CRISPIUS, <fec.  

STEPHEN,  THE  FIRST  MARTYR  (St.) (Dec.  20)  
(1st cent.) The disciple chosen by the 
Apostles,  "full  of  Faith  and  the  Holy  Ghost," 
as  first of  the  seven  deacons  (Acts  vi.  1-5), 
and  who  was  also  the  first  of  Christian  Martyrs.  

He  was  stoned  to  death  (a.d.  33)  by  the  Jews 
(Acts vii.  58). His body was recovered, 
together  with  those  of  SS.  Nicodemus,  Gamaliel 
and  Abibo,  early  in  the  fifth  century  ; and  on 
that  account  a  second  Feast  of  St.  Stephen  is 
kept  annually  on  Aug.  3.

CORNELIUS,  SEXTUS,  FLOS,  QUINCTI ANUS, 
MINERVINUS  and  SIMPLICIAN  (Dec.  31)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(Date  unknown.)  Holy  Martyrs  catalogued as  of  Catania  in  Sicily. All  particulars  regarding them  are  lost. STERCATIUS  (St.)  M.  (July  24)  

See  SS.  VICTOR,  STERCATIUS,  &c. *STONE  (JOHN)  (Bl.)  M.  (May  23)

See  Bl.  JOHN  STOREY. STRATON,  PHILIP  and  EUTYCHIAN  (SS.)  MM.  

(Aug.  17)  
(4th  cent.) These  holy  men  did  their  best, 
and  with  great  success,  to  draw  the  people  of 
Nicomedia (the Imperial  residence)  away 
from  frequenting  the  immoral  spectacles  shown 
in  the  public  theatres,  and  as  a  rule  associated 
with  heathen  worship.  They  were  burned  at 
the  stake  shortly  after  a.d.  300.  

STRATON  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  9)  
(Date  unknown.)  We  have  nothing  of  him 
but  the  mere  name,  without  mention  even  of 
place.  There  is,  however,  a  tradition  that  he 
was  a  Christian  put  to  death  by  being  fastened 
to  two  trees,  bent  towards  each  other,  so  that 
on  their  recoil  he  was  torn  asunder.  This  mode 
of  execution  points  to  the  beginning  of  the 
fourth  centurv.

See  SS.  HIERONIDES,  LEONTIUS,  &c. STRATONICUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  13)  

See  SS.  HERMYLAS  and  STRATONICUS. STURMIUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Dec.  17)  
(8th  cent.)  A  German  Saint,  appointed  by St.  Boniface  to  be  the  first  Abbot  of  his  monastery at  Fulda,  which  was  soon  peopled  by  four hundred  monks.  One  of  the  great  merits  of St.  Sturmio  was  his  foundation  and  organisation of  schools  for  the  gradual  civilising  of  the  wild tribes  surrounding  his  Abbey.  He  was  also an  eloquent  preacher  and  a  successful  missionary. He  is  often  styled  the  "  Apostle  of  the Saxons."  He  died  a.d.  779,  and  was  canonised A.D.  1139. STYLIANUS  (St.)  (Nov.  26)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  hermit  in  the  vicinity of  Adrianople,  held  in  high  veneration  by  the Greeks,  who  have  edited  more  or  less  legendary accounts  of  his  life. STYRIACUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  2)  

See  SS.  CARTERIUS,  STYRIACUS, &c.  

♦SUAIRLECH  (St.)  Bp.  (March  27)  
(8th  cent.)  A  zealous  Abbot  of  Fore  Abbey, 
Westmeath,  who  later  was  consecrated  Bishop.  

He  flourished  in  the  first  half  of  the  eighth 
century.

♦SULINUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Sept.  1)  

Otherwise  St.  SILIN,  which  see. SULPICIUS  PIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  17)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Bourges  (France), the  successor  of  St.  Austrcgisilus.  He  lived  a prayerful  life,  but  is  chiefly  remembered  for his  self-sacrificing  devotedness  to  the  poor.  He died  a.d.  644.  He  is  the  Title  Saint  of  the well-known  Paris  church  of  St.  Sulpice. SULPICIUS  and  SERVILIANUS  (SS.)  MM.  

(April  20)  
(2nd  cent.)  Roman  Saints  whose  conversion to  Christianity  tradition  ascribes  to  the  prayers and  exhortations  of  St.  Domitilla.  They  were beheaded  as  Christians  some  time  during  the reign  of  Trajan  (a.d.  98-117). SULPICIUS  SEVERUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  29)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Bourges  (France) who  died  A.D.  591.  He  was  very  zealous  for Church  discipline,  and  is  said  to  have  been  a learned  man  and  to  have  written  both  in  prose and  in  verse  ;  but  he  must  not  be  confused either  with  the  priest-historian  Sulpicius  Severus (4th  cent.)  or  with  his  own  immediate  successor, Sulpicius  Pius  (7th  cent.). *SUNAMAN  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  15)  

See  SS.  WINAMAN,  UNAMAN  and  SUNAMAN. *SUNNIFA  (St.)  V.M.  (July  3)  
(10th  cent.)  An  Irish  maiden  whom  tradition asserts  to  have  been  cast  away  by  shipwreck on  the  coast  of  Norway,  together  with  other maidens  her  companions.  There  they  appear to  have  led  a  life  of  seclusion  and  prayer.  To them  the  old  Scottish  Church  undoubtedly gave  a  liturgical  cult  us,  as  to  canonised  Saints. SUPERIUS  (St.)  M.  (June  20)  

See  SS.  SALVIUS  and  SUPERIUS. SURANUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (Jan.  24)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Abbot  in  Central  Italy  who, on  the  approach  of  the  Lombards,  then  devastating the  Peninsula,  expended  all  the  goods  of his  monastery  in  relieving  the  poor  fugitives, and  was  on  that  account,  when  the  Barbarians found  that  there  was  nothing  to  pillage  in  the Abbey,  murdered  by  them.  St.  Gregory  is emphatic  in  his  praises  of  St.  Suranus. SUSANNA,  MARCIANA,  PALLADIA  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (May  24)  
(2nd  cent.)  Three  Christian  women  with their  children,  described  in  the  Greek  Menologies  as  having  been  the  wives  of  soldiers (among  the  comrades  of  St.  Meletius)  and  as having,  like  them,  been  put  to  death  in  Galatia (Asia  Minor),  victims  of  one  of  the  earlier persecutions.  The  details,  however,  as  compiled at  a  late  date  by  the  Orientals,  are  untrustworthy. SUSANNA  (St.)  V.M.  (Aug.  11)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  maiden  of  noble  birth, said  to  have  been  a  niece  of  Pope  St. 'Caius. The  prolix  account  given  of  her  in  the  mediaeval legend  is  very  unreliable.  What  appears  certain is  that  on  her  refusal  (about  a.d.  190)  to  marry a  Pagan  relative  of  the  Emperor  Diocletian, she  was  arrested  and  put  to  death  as  a  Cliristian. A  well-known  church  in  Rome  bears  her name. SUSANNA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  The  daughter  of  a  priest  of  idols, who  was  converted  to  Christianity  and  made  a deaconess.  She  was  put  to  death  for  her religion  under  Julian  the  Apostate,  about  a.d. 362. SUSO  (HENRY)  (Bl.)  (Oct.  25)  

See  Bl.  HENRY  SUSO. SWITHBERT  (St.)  Bp.  (March  1)  
(8th  cent.)  One  of  the  twelve  missionaries who,  impelled  by  St.  Egbert,  crossed  over  from England  into  Germanv,  under  the  leadership of  St.  Willibrord  (a.d.  690).  St.  Swithbert laboured  principally  in  Friesland  (Holland  and 
249 

SWITHUN 
North  Belgium)  and,  when  on  a  visit  to  England, was  consecrated  Bishop  by  St.  Wilfrid.  Innumerable were  the  conversions  he  made  among the  Pagans.  In  his  old  age  he  retired  to  a monastery  he  had  built  at  Kaiserswerth  on  the Rhine,  where  he  died  A.D.  713.  

SWITHUN  (St.)  Bp.  (July  2)  
(9th  cent.)  A  monk,  and  afterwards  Bishop of  Winchester,  who  educated  King  Ethelwulph and  was  afterwards  his  chief  Councillor. Striking  virtues  of  St.  Swithun  were  his  meekness and  his  love  of  the  poor.  He  used  to  make his  pastoral  visitations  barefoot,  and  he  quite spent  himself  in  procuring  the  conversion  of sinners.  He  died  July  2,  A.D.  862.  When  his relics  were  translated  (July  15,  A.D.  964),  to be  enshrined  in  his  church,  torrents  of  rain  are alleged  to  have  hindered  or  delayed  the  ceremony. Hence,  it  is  supposed,  the  popular superstition  regarding  rain  on  that  day.  

SY.  Names  beginning  SY  are  quite  as  often vjritten  SI.  Sometimes  too  the  initial  SY  stands for  the  Greek  SU.  

SYAGRIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  27)  
(6th  cent.)  A  famous  Bishop  of  Autun (France),  who  played  a  prominent  part  in  the ecclesiastical  and  political  history  of  his  time. He  received  hospitably  and  entertained  St. Augustine  and  his  fellow-monks  on  their  way to  Kent  to  convert  the  Anglo-Saxons  to  Christianity. In  acknowledgment  of  this  act  of charity,  St.  Gregory  the  Great,  the  Pope  who had  despatched  the  missionaries  to  the  heathens of  England,  granted  to  St.  Syagrius  and  his successors  the  prized  distinction  of  wearing  the ornament  called  the  Pallium.  St.  Syagrius died  a.d.  600,  after  an  Episcopate  of  about forty  years.  

SYCUS  and  PALATINUS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  30)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  most  ancient  Martyrologies  do  no  more  than  register  the  names  of these  Saints  with  the  note  that  for  Christ's sake  they  suffered  many  tortures  at  Antioch in  Syria.  Their  names  are  variously  spelled. There  is  no  further  record  of  them.  

SYLVIA  (St.)  Widow.  (Nov.  3)  
(6th  cent.)  The  mother  of  Pope  St.  Gregory the  Great,  a  matron  ever  held  in  high  honour by  the  Romans  as  a  Saint  and  type  of  a  Christian widow.  Her  holy  son  caused  a  picture  of  St. Sylvia  to  be  painted  for  his  monastery  on  the Ccelian  Hill,  and  her  appearance  and  usual dress  have  therefrom  been  minutely  described by  John  the  deacon,  the  biographer  of  St. Gregory.  

SYMMACHUS  (St.)  Pope.  (July  19)  
(6th  cent.)  Born  in  Sardinia  and  elected Pope  in  succession  to  St.  Anastasius  II  (a.d. 498),  he  entered  upon  a  troubled  Pontificate. An  Anti-Pope,  upheld  by  the  Emperor  of Constantinople,  disputed  his  claim  (clear though  his  right  was)  to  the  Papacy.  Councils assembled  to  arraign  his  conduct ;  and  riots were  stirred  up  in  Rome,  in  one  of  which  he  was assaulted  and  wounded.  He  was,  however, as  history  proves,  both  a  holy  and  an  able  man. He  did  much  for  Church  discipline,  and  many of  his  Decretals  are  still  extant.  He  died  a.d. 514.

See  SS.  CLAUDIUS,  NICOSTRATUS, &c.  

SYMPHORIANUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Christian  of  Autun  (France), put  to  death  about  A.D.  178  for  refusing  to worship  an  idol.  A  succession  of  miracles worked  at  his  tomb  quickly  made  him  famous. A  confusion  between  the  names  of  the  Emperors Marcus  Aurelius  and  Aurelian  has  led  not  a  few writers  to  postdate  St.  Symphorian  by  an entire  centurv.

(SS.)  MM.  

(2nd  cent.)  A  lady  of  Tivoli,  near  Rome, widow  of  the  Martyr  St.  Getulius,  who,  with  her seven  sons,  Crescens,  Julianus,  Nemesius, Primitivus,  Justinus,  Stacteus  and  Eugenius, was  tortured  and  put  to  death  as  a  Christian, under  the  Emperor  Hadrian  (a.d.  120). SYMPHRONIUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  3)  

See  SS.  FELIX,  SYMPHRONIUS, &c. SYMPHSONIUS, OLYMPIUS, THEODULUS and 
EXUPERIA  (SS.)  MM.  (July  26)  
(3rd  cent.)  St.  Symphronius,  a  Roman Christian,  the  slave  of  St.  Nemesius,  also  a Christian,  had  converted  to  Christianity Olympius,  with  his  wife  Exuperia  and  their  son, Theodulus.  They  were  all  burned  to  death  as Christians  in  the  persecution  under  Valerian (a.d.  257),  shortly  before  the  death  of  St. Stephen,  the  Pope,  who  had  baptised  all  or  some of  them  in  the  Catacombs. SYNCLETICA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  5)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Christian  who  lived to  the  age  of  eighty  as  a  recluse  near  Alexandria. St.  Athanasius,  who  wrote  her  Life, enlarges  on  her  patience  under  suffering,  and  her many  other  virtues.  She  died  some  time  after A.D.  350. SYNESIUS  and  THEOPOMPUS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  21)  

Identical  with  the  SS.  THEOPOMPUS  and THEONAS  of  Jan.  3,  for  Theonas  was also  known  as  Synesius.  They  are  twice entered  in  the  Registers,  either  by  an  error  or  on occasion  of  a  second  festival  in  their  honour being  annually  celebrated,  possibly  on  the anniversary  of  some  Translation  of  their  relics. SYNESIUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  12)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  Martyr  beheaded under  Aurelian  (a.d.  275).  He  was  a  Lector  or Reader,  to  which  office  he  had  been  ordained by  Pope  St.  Xystus  II  some  fifteen  years previously.  The  Greeks  give  a  detailed  account of  his  sufferings  in  their  Menaea. SYNTECHES  (St.)  (July  22)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  Christians  of  Philippi in  Macedonia,  mentioned  by  St.  Paul  as  having laboured  with  him  in  the  Gospel  (Phil.  iv.  2-4), "  whose  names  are  in  the  Book  of  Life." Nothing  more  is  known  of  her  nor  of  Evodia, whom  the  Apostle  "  besought  to  be  of  one mind  with  her,"  nor  of  the  "sincere  companion ' '  to  whose  care  they  were  commended. *SYRA  (St.)  V.  (June  8)  
(7th  cent.) A  sister  of  St.  Fiaker  (Fiacre), 
who followed her brother from Ireland to 
France,  and  there  lived a saintly life as a 
nun.  

SYRIA  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (July  31)  
(6th  cent.)  Three  hundred  and  fifty  Catholic 
monks,  massacred  in  Syria  (a.d.  517)  by  the 
heretical  opponents  of  the  Council  of  Chalcedon.

(8th  cent.) A  number  of  Christian  women 
put  to  a  cruel  death  at  Emesa  (Horns)  by  the 
Mohammedan  Arabs,  conquerors  of  Syria 
(A.D.  773).  

SYRUS  (St.)  Bp.  (June  29)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Genoa  in  succession to  St.  Felix.  He  had  previously  been  Parish priest  at  St.  Romulus  (now  corrupted  into San  Remo).  He  worked  many  miracles,  and after  many  years  of  useful  Episcopate  died regretted  and  venerated  as  a  Saint  by  his clergy  and  people. SYRUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  9)  
(1st  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Pavia  in Lombardy,  whither  tradition  alleges  he  was sent  to  preach  Christianity  by  St.  Peter  the Apostle,  together  with  St.  Juventius,  his successor.  The  extant  Life  of  St.  Syrus, written  many  centuries  later,  is  open  to  much criticism. *SYTHA  (St.)  V.  (May  19)  

Otherwise  St.  OSYTH,  which  see.

TALARICAN  (TARKIN)  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  30)  
(7th  cent.)  A  missionary  in  Scotland  who worked  mainly  in  Aberdeenshire.  An  old tradition  alleges  that  St.  Gregory  the  Great consecrated  him  Bishop  when  he  was  in  Rome on  a  pilgrimage.

Otherwise  St.  AMATA,  which  see.

which he placed under the government of 
St.  Barr.  

TAMMARAS  (St.)  (Sept.  1)  

See  SS.  PBJSCUS,  CASTRENSIS,  &c. *TANCA  (St.)  V.M.  (Oct.  10)  
(7th  cent.) A  young  girl  of  the  neighbourhood of  Troyes  in  France,  who  lost  her  life  in defence  of  her  honour,  and  is  locally  venerated as  a  Virgin-Martyr.
♦TANCHON  (TANCHO)  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  15)  
(7th  or  8th  cent.)  An  Irish  missionary  to Pagan  Germany.  He  spread  the  knowledge of  the  Gospel  more  especially  in  Saxony.  He became  the  third  Bishop  of  Werden,  and  in  the end  suffered  martyrdom. *TARAGHTA  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  11)  

Otherwise  St.  ATTRACTA,  which  see.  

TARBULA  (St.)  M.  (April  22)  
(4th cent.) A holy woman, sister of  the 
MartyrBishop,  St.  Simeon  of  Ctesiphon,  one  of

on  Good  Friday,  A.D.  345.  

♦TARKIN  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  30)

TARSUS  (MARTYRS  of)  (SS.)  (June  6)  
(3rd cent.)  Twenty victims at Tarsus in 
Asia  Minor  of  the  persecution  under  Diocletian.  

a.d.  290  is  given  as  the  date  of  their  martyrdom.  

They were famous in antiquity, and their 
relics seem (at  least in part)  to  have  been 
transported to Africa, where St. Augustine 
makes mention of them.  Authentic details 
concerning  their  lives  and  sufferings  are  now 
lacking.  

♦TASSACH  (St.)  Bp.  (April  14)  
(5th cent.)  One of St. Patrick's earliest 
disciples  and  Irish  converts.  St.  Tassach  was 
appointed  Bishop  of  Raholp  (Down).  He  was 
a  skilful artisan and manufactured croziers, 
crosses  and  shrines  for  St.  Patrick.  He  had  the 
privilege  of  administering  the  Holy  Viaticum 
to  the  dying  Apostle,  whom  he  survived  till 
towards  the  close  of  the  fifth  century.  

♦TATE  (St.)  Widow.  (April  5)  

Otherwise  St.  ETHELBURGA,  which  see.  

♦TATHAI  (TATH^US,  ATH/EUS)  (St.)  (Dec.  26)  
(5th  cent.) An  Irish  monk  or  hermit,  who 
lived  a  holy  life  in  Britain,  chiefly  at  Llan
tathan  in  Wales,  to  which  place  he  has  left 
his  name.

See  SS.  HILARY,  TATIAN, &c. TATIAN  DULAS  (St.)  M.  (June  15)  

Otherwise  St.  DULAS,  which  see.  

TATIAN  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  12)  

See  SS.  MACEDONIUS,  THEODULUS, &c.  

TATIANA  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  12)  
(3rd  cent.)  A Christian woman  in Rome, 
cast  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the  Amphitheatre, 
but miraculously preserved from them and 
in  the  end  beheaded,  during  the  reign  of  the 
Emperor  Alexander  Severus  (a.d. 227).  She 
may  be  identical  with  the  St.  Daciana  whom 
the  Greeks  honour  on  Jan. 12  ; but  is  quite 
other than the famous Roman Martyr St.  

Martina  who  suffered  about  the  same  time, 
and  with whom some of the moderns have 
sought  to  identify  her. 

TATIO  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  24)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Martyr  under  Diocletian  in Asia  Minor.  While  being  fiercely  tortured, he  saw  a  vision  of  Angels  welcoming  him  to  his everlasting  home,  and  passed  away  before  the executioners  could  complete  their  savage  work (a.d.  304  about).  

TATTA  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  25)  

See  SS.  PAULUS,  TATTA,  &c.  

♦TATWIN  (St.)  Bp.  (July  30)  
(8th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Brithwald in  the  Archbishopric  of  Canterbury.  During his  short  Episcopate  of  two  years,  he  distinguished himself  by  his  piety  and  prudence.  He passed  away,  A.D.  734.  

TAURINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  11)  
(1st  cent.)  Traditionally  venerated  as  the Founder  of  the  Churches  of  Evreux  and  Bayeux in  Normandy,  and  regarded  as  having  been  sent thither  by  Pope  St.  Clement  about  a.d.  77. We  have,  however,  no  reliable  records,  and modern  authorities  postdate  St.  Taurinus  by at  least  a  century.  In  the  ninth  century,  at the  time  of  the  invasion  of  the  Normans,  his relics  were  transferred  to  the  Abbey  of  Gigny in  Burgundy  ;  and  both  before  and  after  this numberless  miracles  were  wrought  at  his shrine.  

TAURIO  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  7)  

See  SS.  AUCTUS,  TAURIO,  &c.  

♦TEATH  (TEATHA,  EATHA)  (St.)  (Jan.  15)  

Otherwise  St.  ITA,  which  see. The  Title  Saint  of  the  Church  of  St.  Teath in  Cornwall  is  perhaps  another  Saint  of  that name ;  as  there  is  believed  to  have  been  a St.  Teath  from  Wales,  a  daughter  of  the  chieftain Brychan  of  Brecknock.  Means  of  elucidating the  matter  are  lacking.  

♦TEGLA  (St.)  V.  (June  1)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  the Church  and  holy  well  at  Llandegla  in  Denbighshire. No  particulars  are  extant  concerning her ;  and  some  conjecture  her  to  be  no  other than  St.  Thecla  (Sept.  23),  associated  with St.  Paul  the  Apostle,  to  whom  there  is  no reason  why  a  church  should  not  have  been dedicated  in  Wales.  

♦TEILO  (THELIAU,  DILLO)  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  9) (6th  cent.)  A  famous  Saint  of  South  Wales, disciple  of  St.  Dubritius,  and  friend  of  SS. Samson  and  David.  Records  exist  of  his pilgrimages  to  Rome  and  Brittany,  where churches  bear  his  name.  He  became  the successor  of  both  St.  Dubritius  and  St.  David in  the  Primacy  of  Wales  and  in  the  Bishopric of  Llandaff,  where  his  zeal  and  charity  won him  great  repute.  He  died  at  his  monastery of  Llan-Deilo-Vawr,  a.d.  560.  

TELEMACHUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  8)  

Otherwise  St.  ALMACHIUS,  which  see.  

TELESPHORUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Jan.  5)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Greek  by  birth,  he  succeeded St.  Xystus  I  in  St.  Peter's  Chair  (a.d.  142), and  twelve  years  later  received  the  crown  of martyrdom.  Some  authorities,  however,  date his  Pontificate  from  a.d.  126  to  a.d.  142.  He did  much  for  Church  discipline  and  was  altogether an  able  Pope  and  truly  a  "  man  of  God." It  was  he,  it  is  said,  who  made  the  observance of  Lent  obligatory  on  Christians.  He  is  also credited  with  having  introduced  the  chanting of  the  Hymn  Gloria  in  excelsis  into  the  Mass, and  with  having  been  the  first  to  celebrate  the Three  Masses  of  Christmas  Day.  From  this tradition  he  has  come  to  be  represented  in  art as  holding  in  his  hand  a  chalice  with  three hosts.  

♦TENENAN  (St.)  Bp.  (July  16)  
(7th  cent.)  Born  in  Great  Britain,  he embraced  the  life  of  a  hermit  in  Brittany, where,  after  many  years,  the  people,  impressed by  his  abilities  and  virtues,  insisted  on  having him  for  their  Bishop  at  Leon.  He  died  a.d. 635.

TERENTIANUS 
TERENTIANUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Sept.  1)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Todi  in  Umbria (Central  Italy),  who  laid  down  his  life  for Christ  under  the  Emperor  Hadrian  (a.d.  118). No  other  reliable  particulars  respecting  him  arc obtainable.  

TERENTIUS,  AFRICANUS,  POMPEIUS  and OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (April  10)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  band  of  thirty  Christian  heroes put  to  death  on  account  of  their  religion  in Africa  in  the  Decian  persecution  (a.d.  250). A  hundred  years  later  their  relics  were  translated to  Constantinople.  

TERENTIUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (June  21)  
(1st  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Iconium (Asia  Minor).  Little  or  nothing  is  known about  him  ;  but  tradition  has  it  that  he  was one  of  the  seventy-two  disciples  sent  out  to preach  by  Christ  Himself  (Luke  x.  1).  Again, many  think  that  this  Terentius  is  one  and  the same  with  the  Tertius  who  was  St.  Paul's amanuensis  when  he  wrote  his  Epistle  to  the Romans  (Rom.  xvi.  22).  

TERENTIUS  of  TODI  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  27)  

See  SS.  FIDENTIUS  and  TERENTIUS.  

TERESA  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  15)  
(16th  cent.)  Many  lives  of  this  Saint  have been  published ;  but  the  best  is  her  Autobiography written  with  charming  candour, and,  from  the  literary  point  of  view,  a  Spanish classic.  Teresa,  daughter  of  Alphonsus  Sanchez de  Cepeda,  was  born  at  Avila,  a.d.  1515,  and passed  away  at  Alba  de  Tonnes,  A.D.  1582. Her  life-work  was  the  Reform  of  the  Carmelite Order,  which  she  had  entered  in  her  youth. Without  help  and  often  misunderstood  or  set aside  as  a  visionary,  she  herself  founded  thirtytwo  convents.  Her  Reform  spread  all  over  the world,  and  nourishes  to  the  present  day. Though  all  her  long  life  an  indefatigably  active toiler,  St.  Teresa  was  in  the  main  a  contemplative, favoured  with  the  grace  of  high  prayer and  enriched  with  extraordinary  supernatural gifts.  The  works  on  Mystical  Prayer  she  has left  us  continue  to  be  text-books  on  the  subject.  

♦TERNAN  (TORANNAN)  (St.)  Bp.  (June  12)  
(5th  cent.)  The  zealous  Bishop  consecrated 
by  St.  Palladius  as  chief  Pastor  over  the  Church

(5th  cent.)  The  eighth  Bishop  of  Bologna (Central  Italy),  contemporary  with  the  Fall  of the  Western  Roman  Empire  and  the  invasion of  Italy  by  Odoacer,  King  of  the  Heruli.  He died  towards  the  end  of  the  fifth  century.  

TERTULLINUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  4)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  Christian  who, two 
days after  his ordination  to the priesthood, 
was arrested and put to death under the 
Emperor  Valerian  (a.d.  257).  

♦TETTA  (St.)  V.  (Sept,  28)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Abbess  of  Wimborne,  friend of  St.  Boniface.  She  is  said  to  have  had  at  one time  five  hundred  nuns  under  her  spiritual guidance.  She  passed  away  in  the  second  half of  the  eighth  century,  and  many  miracles  were afterwards  attributed  to  her  intercession.  

♦THADD/EUS  MACHAR  (Bl.)  Bp.  (Oct.  25)  
(15th  cent.)  Thaddseus  Machar  (McCarthy), Bishop  of  Ross  and  afterwards  of  Cork  and Cloyne,  died  in  Piedmont  while  on  his  return journey  from  a  pilgrimage  to  Rome  (a.d.  1497). Wonderful  miracles  attested  his  sanctity  and led  to  his  Beatification.  

THADD/EUS  (St.)  Apostle.  (Oct.  28)  

Otherwise  St.  JUDE,  which  see.  

♦THAIS  (St.)  Penitent.  (Oct.  8)  
(4th  cent.)  The  famous  convert  from  a long  life  of  sin,  drawn  to  Christ  and  to  penance 252 

in  Egypt  by  St.  Paphnutius.  For  many  years the  repentant  woman  was  shut  up  in  a  sealed cell  and  only  towards  the  close  of  her  life  was she  allowed  by  her  spiritual  advisers,  St. Antony,  St.  Paul  the  Simple  and  St.  Paphnutius, to  share  even  the  austere  life  of  the  other Sisters.  She  died  a.d.  348. THALAUEUS, ASTERIUS, ALEXANDER and 
OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  20)  
(3rd  cent.)  Asterius  and  Alexander  were the  executioners  sent  to  inflict  capital  punishment on  St.  Thalalseus,  condemned  to  death  as a  Cliristian.  At  sight  of  the  constancy  of  the holy  Martyr,  they,  with  others  of  the  bystanders, declared  themselves  Christians,  and  all  shared his  fate  (a.d.  272)  in  the  reign  of  the  Emperor Numerian.  The  Roman  Martyrology  marks their  martyrdom  as  having  taken  place  at Edessa  in  Syria  ;  but  it  now  appears  that  this is  a  mistake  for  a  less  known  city  of  the  same name  in  Cilicia  (Asia  Minor).
♦THALASSIUS  (St.)  Hermit.  (Feb.  22)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Solitary  in  Syria,  where,  with his  disciple  St.  Limnseus,  he  inhabited  a  cave. He  was  famous  among  the  Greeks  for  his sanctity  of  life  ;  and  one  of  the  churches  of Constantinople  was  dedicated  to  him. *THALIUEUS  (St.)  (Feb.  27)  
(5th  cent.)  A  hermit  in  Cilicia  (Asia  Minor), who  passed  sixty  years  in  the  practice  of  the most  severe  penance. THALUS  (St.)  M.  (March  11)  

See  SS.  TROPHIMUS  and  THALUS. THAMEL  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  4)  
(2nd  cent.)  St.  Thamel  was  a  Pagan  priest converted  to  Christianity  who,  with  four  or Ave  others  (one  of  them  his  own  sister),  bravely laid  down  his  life  for  Christ,  somewhere  in  the East,  under  the  Emperor  Hadrian  (a.d.  125, about). THARACUS,  PROBUS  and  ANDRONICUS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  11)  
(4th  cent.)  Christians  martyred  during  the persecution  (A.D.  304)  at  Tarsus  in  Cilicia  (Asia Minor).  Tharacus  appears  to  have  been  a Roman  soldier,  Probus  a  stranger  from  Pamphylia,  and  Andronicus  a  prominent  citizen  of Ephesus. THARASIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  25)  
(9th  cent.)  A  Patriarch  of  Constantinople who  presided  over  that  Church  in  the  troublous times  of  the  Iconoclast  Emperors.  The Empress  Irene,  a  cruel  and  worthless  woman, was  a  principal  abettor  of  the  heretics.  In the  Acts  of  the  Second  Council  of  Constantinople, convened  by  Pope  Hadrian  I  to  oppose  the innovators,  St.  Tharasius  is  first  named  after the  Papal  Legates.  Throughout  his  Episcopate the  Saint  showed  himself,  as  a  shepherd  of  souls, able  and  willing  to  denounce  the  vices  of  the Byzantine  Princes  and  of  their  profligate  Courts. On  the  other  hand,  he  earned  for  himself  the glorious  title  of  "  Father  of  the  poor."  He died  holilv,  as  he  had  lived,  A.D.  806. THARBA  (St.)  M.  (April  22)  

See  SS.  AZADES,  THARBA, &c. THARSICIUS,  ZOTICUS,  CYRIACUS  and  OTHERS 
(SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  31)  
(Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  at  Alexandria  in Egypt, but  of  whom, beyond  the  names  of some  of  them,  we  now  know  nothing  at  all. THARSICIUS  (TARCISIUS)  (St.)  M. (Aug.  15)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Roman  acolyte,  whose  duty  it was  to  carry  the  Blessed  Sacrament  to  the sick  or  from  church  to  church,  as  needed.  On one  occasion,  while  doing  so,  he  was  set  upon by  a  heathen  mob  and  beaten  to  death  in  the public  streets.  This  happened  during  the Pontificate  of  Pope  St.  Stephen  I  (A.D.  254-257). THARSILLA  (St.)  V.  (Dec.  24)  
(6th  cent.)  A  maiden  aunt  of  Pope  St. Gregory  the  Great,  who,  with  her  sister,  St. .Emiliaiia,  lived  a  life  of  prayer  and  good works  in  Rome  till  her  death,  which  happened

See  SS.  EUPHEMIA,  DOROTHEA, &c. THECLA  (St.)  V.M.  (Sept.  23)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  most  celebrated  of  the Saints  of  the  Early  Church.  St.  Epiphanius and  others  relate  that  she  was  converted  at Iconium  in  Lycaonia  by  St.  Paid  when  preaching there  (Acts  xiv.) ;  and  it  would  appear that  she  afterwards  attached  herself  to  the service  of  the  Apostle,  attending  him  on several  of  his  missionary  journeys.  St.  Thecla died  before  the  close  of  the  first  century, having,  it  is  believed,  spent  her  last  years  in religious  seclusion.  She  had  suffered  much  for Christ,  especially  on  three  occasions,  her  being cast  to  the  wild  beasts  in  the  Amphitheatre, her  being  thrown  into  a  furnace  of  fire,  and  her being  cast  out  literally  destitute  by  her  heathen parents  and  kinsfolk.  To  these  sufferings, equivalent,  taken  together,  to  a  martyrdom, Holy  Church  makes  reference  in  her  Prayers for  the  Dying.  Almighty  God  helped  St. Thecla  many  times  by  miraculous  interpositions ;  but  a  number  of  fabulous  accretions afterwards  found  their  way  into  her  Acts, which  have  therefore  been  censured  by  the Popes  and  Fathers. THECLA  (St.)  V.  (Oct.  15)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  maiden,  who. with  St.  Lioba  and  others,  followed  St.  Boniface to  Germany  to  co-operate  in  his  missionary work.  She  formed  a  community  of  nuns  at Kitzingen,  near  Wurzburg,  over  which  she presided  till  her  death  (A.D.  769). THECUSA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  J  8)

THEOBALD  (St.)  Hermit.  (July  1)  
(11th  cent.)  A  Frenchman,  son  of  a  Count of  Champagne,  who  when  eighteen  years  old embraced  the  life  of  a  hermit  and  persevered therein  till  his  death,  thirty  years  later  (A.D. 1066).  To  escape  observation,  he  dwelt  for part  of  the  time  in  Germany,  and  for  part  in the  North  of  Italy.  He  was  canonised  in  the twelfth  century  by  Pope  Alexander  111.
♦THEOBALD  (Bl.)  (July  8)  
(13th  cent.)  A  French  noble  of  the  Montmorency family  who,  renouncing  his  worldly prospects,  became  a  Cistercian  monk.  "  He lived  (says  Butler)  in  the  midst  of  his  brethren as  the  servant  of  every  one,  and  surpassed  all others  in  his  love  of  poverty,  silence  and  holy prayer."  He  died  A.D.  1247. THEOCLISTES  (St.)  V.  (Nov.  10)  
(10th  cent.)  A  Greek  Saint  who  lived  as  a Recluse  in  one  of  the  islets  of  the  iEgean  Sea, and who  is greatly  venerated  in  the East. 

There  has  come  down  to  us  a  charming  narrative of  a  visit  paid  to  her  by  a  contemporary,  an Official  of  the  Imperial  Court.  He  tells  us  how he  had  brought  to  Theoclistes  the  Lord's  Body in  a  pyx,  and  how  she,  on  receiving  the  Bread  of Life,  forthwith  sang  her  Nunc  dimittis  and passed  from  this  world. THEODARD  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Sept.  10)

While  journeying  into  Burgundy  to seek  redress  for  wrongs  done  to  his  Church,  he was  set  upon  by  evildoers  and  murdered  (A.D. 668).  His  relics  were  enshrined  at  Liege. THEODEMIRUS  (St.)  M.  (July  25)  
(9th  cent.) A  monk  of  Cordova  in  Spain 
who  received  the  crown  of  martyrdom  at  the 
hands  of  the  Moorish  oppressors  of  that  country 
(A.D.  851).

THEODORA  and  DIDYMUS  (SS.)  MM. (April  28)  
(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Alexandria  in  Egypt, under  Diocletian  (a.d.  304).  Didymus,  then  a Pagan,  had  succeeded  in  protecting  the  virtue of  the  virgin  Theodora.  He  became  a  Christian like  her.  They  were  condemned  and  executed together. THEODORA  (St.)  V.M.  (May  7)

(5th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  woman  of  Alexandria, who,  repenting  of  a  sin  committed  in her  youth,  lived  a  long  life  of  austere  penance. Many  legends  exist  concerning  her ;  but nothing  is  now  really  known  either  as  to  the nature  of  her  fault  or  as  to  the  punishment  she inflicted  upon  herself  in  reparation  of  it. THEODORA  (St.)  Matron.  (Sept.  17)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  woman  of  noble birth  who,  during  the  great  persecution  under Diocletian,  ministered  to  the  best  of  her  power to  the  needs  of  the  Holy  Martyrs,  and,  when able,  secured  honourable  burial  for  their remains.  She  is  believed  to  have  passed  away in  Rome  in  a.d.  305,  while  the  persecution  was still  raging. THEODORE  (St.)  (Jan.  7)  
(4th  cent.) An  Egyptian  monk,  disciple  of

THEODORE  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  7)  
(4th  cent.)  A  General  in  the  army  of  the Emperor  Licinius.  The  latter  continued  to persecute  Christianity  in  the  East  even  after the  general  peace  of  the  Church  had  been assured  by  Constantine.  St.  Theodore  was  one of  the  victims  of  Licinius.  He  suffered  at Heraclea  in  Thrace  (A.D.  318),  and  is  greatly venerated  by  the  Greeks. THEODORE  (St.)  M.  ,  (March  17)

THEODORE 
THEODORE  TRICHINAS  (St.)  (April  20)  
(4th cent.) A holy hermit near Constantinople, famous  for  his  power  of  casting  out devils.  The  precise  date  of  his  death  is  uncertain, but  it  is  later  than  A.D.  320. THEODORE  (St.)  Bp.  (April  22)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Bishop  in  Galatia  (Asia  Minor) who,  having  borne  the  weight  of  his  charge  for ten  years,  retired  again  to  the  solitary  cell whence  he  had  reluctantly  allowed  himself  to be  drawn.  He  died  A.D.  613. THEODORE  (St.)  Bp.  (May  5)  
(6th  cent.) A  Bishop  of  Bologna  in  Central Italy,  registered  as  a  Saint  in  all  the  Martyr  ologies,  but  of  whom  we  have  no  other  information. THEODORE  (St.)  Bp.  (May  20)  
(8th  cent.)  A  celebrated  Bishop  of  Pavia  in Lombardy,  which  See  he  held  for  forty-seven years,  guiding  and  safeguarding  his  flock  with wonderful  assiduity  and  success.  In  the  wars between  the  Frankish  monarchs  and  the  Lombard kings  his  prudence  and  zeal  were  more than  once  the  means  of  saving  Pavia  from destruction.  Nevertheless,  the  boldness  with which  he  faced  the  great  ones  of  the  earth, at  one  phase  of  the  struggle,  entailed  his banishment.  He  died  a.d.  778.  Some  fragments of  his  Sermons  are  still  extant. THEODORE  (St.)  Bp.  (July  4)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  and  Martyr  of  Cyrene in  Libya.  He  had  great  skill  in  copying manuscripts  ;  and  his  refusal  to  deliver  up  his own  and  other  copies  of  the  Sacred  Scriptures (a  point  much  insisted  upon  by  Diocletian)  led to  his  being  tortured  even  more  fiercely  than other  Christian  heroes,  before  being  beheaded. He  suffered  about  A.D.  310. THEODORE  (St.)  M.  (July  29)

There,  he  (aided  by  the  Abbot  Hadrian,  who had  accompanied  him  from  Rome)  founded  a celebrated  school  of  learning,  not  only  ecclesiastical but  secular.  The  Church  in  England flourished  marvellously  under  his  rule.  He died  a.d.  690,  at  the  age  of  eighty-eight,  and was  buried  in  the  monastery  of  SS.  Peter  and Paul  (afterwards  St.  Augustine's  Abbey), outside  the  walls  of  Canterbury.  We  have from  the  pen  of  St.  Theodore  a  famous  Book  of Canons  or  Penitential. THEODORE,  PHILIPPA  and  OTHERS (Sept.  20)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  St.  Theodore,  a  Christian  of Pamphylia  (Asia  Minor),  was  crucified  for Christ's  sake  under  the  Emperor  Heliogabalus (A.D.  220).  Two  soldiers,  Socrates  and  Dionysius,  were  put  to  death  with  him.  And  last came  the  turn  of  his  mother,  St.  Philippa, who  gave  her  life  for  her  religion  bravely  like the  rest. THEODORE  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  23)

A  priest  of  Antioch,  Treasurer  of the  Church  of  that  city  who,  defying  the  edicts of  the  Emperor  Julian  the  Apostate  against  the Christians,  continued  notwithstanding  to  minister publicly  to  the  Faithful.  He  was  put  to the  torture  and  beheaded  (a.d.  362),  but  not

before  he  had  prophecied  the  imminent  downfall and  miserable  death  of  the  tyrant.  

THEODORE  (THEUDAR)  (St.)  Abbot.  (Oct.  29J (6th  cent.)  A  holy  priest  of  Vienne  in Dauphine  (France),  a  disciple  of  St.  Cesarius  of Aries.  He  passed  his  whole  life  in  the  doing  of good  works,  and  to  him  the  Diocese  of  Vienne owes  the  erection  of  several  churches  and monasteries.  He  died  about  A.D.  575.  Locally he  is  known  as  St.  Chef.  

THEODORE  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  9)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Christian  soldier  in  the  Roman Army,  serving  in  Pontus  (Asia  Minor),  probably his  native  country,  where  he  was  arrested,  it would  seem,  by  order  of  the  Emperor  Maximian Herculeus.  He  was  put  to  the  torture  and burned  to  death  for  the  Faith  (A.D.  306).  The translation  of  some  of  his  relics  to  Rome  has gained  for  him  special  Liturgical  commemoration in  the  West.  

THEODORE  STUDITA  (St.)  Abbot.  (Nov.  12) (9th  cent.)  A  monk  of  Constantinople,  and afterwards  Abbot  of  his  monastery.  He  was  a man  of  great  learning  and  ability,  and  rendered important  services  to  religion  by  manfully resisting  the  Iconoclast  Emperors  of  Constantinople and  the  heretics  they  patronised. Four  times  in  his  life  St.  Theodore  was  banished, and  he  ended  his  days  in  exile  (a.d.  826), being  then  over  eighty  years  of  age.  Several of  the  controversial  works  he  wrote  are  still extant.

THEODORE  and  THEOPHANES  (SS.)  (Dec.  27) (9th  cent.)  Two  brothers  who  became monks  together  in  the  monastery  of  St.  Sabbas in  Jerusalem.  They  fought  valiantly  for  the Catholic  Faith  in  the  calamitous  times  of  the Iconoclast  Emperors  of  Constantinople.  Again and  again  they  suffered  imprisonment  and banishment.  Theodore  died  in  prison  (A.D. 842),  but  Theophanes  survived  the  persecution and  was  made  Bishop  of  Nicsea.  The  exact date  of  his  death  is  not  known.  

THEODORE  (St.)  (Dec.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  An  Abbot  of  Tabenna  and  one of  the  most  famous  of  the  "  Fathers  of  the Desert."  He  had  been  trained  to  the  vocation of  a  Solitary  by  the  great  Founder,  St.  Pacomius, in  whose  Life  (a  classic  of  its  kind)  mention  of St.  Theodore  often  recurs.

(4th  cent.)  St.  Theodosia,  mother  of  the Martyr  St.  Procopius  is,  by  tradition,  held  to have  suffered  death  for  the  Christian  Faith, together  with  twelve  other  pious  women,  at Csesarea  Philippi  in  Palestine,  about  A.D.  303. But  the  learned  Bollandists  put  little  faith  in the  legends  current  concerning  them. THEODOSIUS  (St.)  (Jan.  11)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Cappadocian  Christian  who embraced  the  life  of  a  Solitary  in  Palestine, and  there  founded  a  famous  monastery  near the  Laura  of  St.  Sabbas.

(4th  cent.)  St.  Theodotus,  a  pious  Christian of  Ancyra  in  Galatia  (Asia  Minor)  had  been energetic  in  seeking  to  recover  the  bodies  of the  holy  women  above  named,  done  to  death for  their  Faith  under  Diocletian  (a.d.  304, about).  For  this  he  was  made  to  share  their fate,  that  of  being  driven  into  a  quicksand, to  be  swallowed  up  in  it. THEODOTUS  (St.)  M.  (July  5)  

See  SS.  MARINUS,  THEODOTUS, &c. THEODOTUS,  RUFINA  and  AMMIA  (Aug.  31) (SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  According  to  Greek  tradition, SS.  Theodotus  and  Rufina  were  the  parents, 

and  St.  Ammia  the  foster-mother  of  St.  Mammas the  Martyr  (Aug.  17).  They  are  said  to  have, like  him,  suffered  death  for  Christ  in Cappadocia  under  the  Emperor  Aurelian  about a.d.  270.  But  the  evidence  in  support  of  the details  of  the  tradition  is  very  slight. THEODOTUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  2)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Laodicea  in  Asia Minor,  a  man  of  singular  learning  and  piety. He  appears  by  his  tactful  prudence  to  have been  of  great  help  in  safeguarding  the  Faith of  the  Laodiceans  at  the  breaking  out  of  the Arian  heresy.  He  died  A.D.  334,  nine  years after  the  Council  of  Nicsea.  The  account  we have  of  the  Bishops  of  Laodicea  of  the  period comes  from  the  pen  of  the  historian  Eusebius, always  inclined  to  favour  the  Arians.  Hence the  doubts  of  some  moderns  as  to  the  orthodoxy of  St.  Theodotus.  But  they  may  safely  be passed  over.

He  died  a.d.  776,  and  many miracles  worked  at  his  tomb  testified  to  his sanctity.  Locally  he  is  known  as  St.  Thiou. THEODULUS  (St.)  M.  (Feb.  17)  
(4th  cent.)  An  aged  Christian  of  the  household of  Firmilian,  Prefect  of  the  City  of  Rome, who,  by  the  order  of  his  Pagan  master,  was crucified  at  Csesarea  in  Palestine  during  the persecution  under  Diocletian  and  his  colleagues (a.d.  308).

have  been  lost.  Hence  some  controversy  among modern  scholars  as  to  the  date  and  place  of  their Passion.

(3rd  cent.)  The  successor  (A.D.  282)  of  St. Maximus  and  predecessor  of  the  better  known St.  Peter  Martyr  in  the  Patriarchal  See  of Alexandria.  The  records  of  his  Episcopate seem  to  have  perished  in  the  destruction  of  all Sacred  Writings  under  Diocletian.  St.  Theonas himself  was  allowed  to  die  in  peace  (A.D.  300). He  is  said  to  have  been  a  zealous  opponent  of the  Sabellian  heretics,  numerous  and  influential in  his  time.  

THEONESTUS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Oct.  30)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Altino  near  Venice. When  a  simple  priest  he  had  joined  with  St. Alban,  an  African  priest,  in  a  mission  to  the heathens  of  Germany.  St.  Alban  met  with  his death  at  the  hands  of  the  Barbarians  near Mainz  about  A.D.  400.  St.  Theonestus  returned to  Italy  and  became  a  Bishop.  The  tradition is  that  he  too  was  a  Martyr,  having  been murdered  bv  the  Arians  in  A.D.  425.

THEOPEMPTUS  and  THEONAS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  3) (4th  cent.)  St.  Theopemptus,  an  Asiatic, may  have  been  a  Bishop.  He  was  beheaded on  account  of  his  religion,  after  the  usual preliminary  torture,  probably  at  the  Imperial Residence,  Nicomedia,  on  the  Sea  of  Marmora. The  date  generally  accepted  is  A.D.  304,  though the  Bollandists  prefer  A.D.  284.  Theonas  is described  as  a  "magus,"  by  which  would  be meant  either  a  sorcerer  or  a  priest  of  some Oriental  heathen  religion.  He  was  converted to  Christianity  on  witnessing  the  miracles wrought  by  the  dying  Martyr  Theopemptus. He  declared  himself  a  Christian  and  was  thereupon buried  alive.  

THEOPHANES  (St.)  (March  12)

For  their  defence  of  the Catholic  belief  in  the  veneration  due  to  Sacred Pictures,  they  were  thrown  into  prison  and  put to  the  torture.  Under  it  Theophanes  expired  ; the  other  three  survived  to  give  themselves  up to  the  service  of  God  in  a  monastery.

Both  Eusebius  and  St.  Jerome  speak  admiringly  of  the holiness  of  his  life. THEOPHILUS  (St.)  Bp.  (March  7)  
(9th  cent.)  An  Asiatic  monk,  disciple  of  St. Tharasius,  Patriarch  of  Constantinople,  by whom  he  was  consecrated  Bishop  of  Nicomedia. He  bravely  upheld  the  Catholic  practice  of venerating  Sacred  Pictures  and  statues  against the  Iconoclast  Emperors  of  his  time.  He  was banished  for  this,  and  died  thirty  years  later, still  in  exile  (A.D.  845). THEOPHILUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  27)

As  Admiral  of  the  Christian Fleet,  he  bravely  refused  to  fly  when  the  battle went  against  him,  though  forsaken  by  all  the ships  other  than  his  own.  He  was  taken prisoner  at  last,  and  after  four  years  of  imprisonment was  given  his  choice  between  renouncing Christ  or  dying  as  a  malefactor.  Thereupon he  joyfully  gave  his  life  for  his  Saviour  (a.d. 789). THEOPHILUS  (St.)  M.  (July  23)

(Date  unknown.)  St.  Horres  was  the  son  of St.  Theuseta  or  Theusita.  The  six  Christians were  put  to  death  at  Nicsea  in  Bithynia.  The tradition  is  that  others  suffered  with  them. But  all  particulars  have  long  since  been  lost. THIERRY  (St.)  (July  1)  

Otherwise  St.  THEODORIC,  which  see.  

♦THILLO  (TILMAN)  (St.)  (Jan.  7)  
(8th cent.) By birth a Saxon.  He was 
carried as a  prisoner  of war  into Flanders, 
where he was baptised by St. Eligius.  He 
worked  as  a  missionary  in  the  country  about 
Tournai  and  Courtrai,  but  retired  some  years 
before his death  to  the Abbey  of Solignac, 
where  he  passed  away  a.d.  702.  

THIOU  (St.)  Bp.  (June  24)  

Otherwise  St.  THEODULPHUS,  which  see. *THIRKILL  (RICHARD)  (Bl.)  M.  (May  29)  

See  Bl.  RICHARD  THIRKILL. THOMAIDES  (St.)  M.  (April  14)  
(5th  cent.)  An  Egyptian  matron  of  Alexandria, who  suffered  death  in  defence  of  her Faith  and  virtue.  There  are  other  legendary details,  but  the  evidence in  their  support is 
♦THOMAS  PLUMTREE  (Bl.)  M.  (Jan.  4)  
(16th  cent.)  A  priest  of  the  North  of  England ordained  in  the  reign  of  Queen  Mary,  who  acted as  Chaplain  to  the  insurgents  in  the  famous rising  under  the  Earls  of  Northumberland  and Westmoreland.  He  was  offered  his  life  on condition  of  his  turning  Protestant ;  and  his courage  in  refusing  makes  his  execution  at Durham  (a.d.  1570)  to  be  rightly  styled  a martyrdom.  His  Christian  name  is  sometimes given  as  William.
♦THOMAS  of  CORA  (Bl.)  (Jan.  11)  
(18th  cent.)  A  Franciscan  Friar  of  a  convent in  the  neighbourhood  of  Rome.  He  was  an exact  observer  of  his  Rule  and  a  man  of  austere piety.  He  may  be  said  to  have  passed  his  life in  instructing  the  ignorant  and  in  comforting the  sick  and  afflicted.  He  died  at  the  age  of seventy-four,  a.d.  1729.
♦THOMAS  SHERWOOD  (Bl.)  M.  (Feb.  7)  
(16th  cent.)  A  youth  who,  yet  a  layman, designed  to  cross  to  Douai  and  become  a  priest. This  being  betrayed  to  the  authorities,  they caused  him  to  be  arrested,  racked  and  otherwise grievously  tortured.  In  the  eDd  he  was  hanged and  cut  down  alive,  to  be  afterwards  barbarously butchered  at  Tyburn  (a.d.  1578). THOMAS  AQUINAS  (St.)  Doctor  of (March  7)  

the  Church.  

(13th  cent.)  The  famous  "  Angelic  Doctor," the  chief  exponent  of  Scholastic  Philosophy, which  is  fundamentally  that  of  Aristotle, brought  into  harmony  with  Christian  belief. He  was  one  of  the  most  marvellously  gifted  of thinkers.  Born  near  Aquino  in  the  South  of Italy  (a.d.  1225),  and  educated  at  Monte Cassino,  he  joined  the  then  newly  founded Dominican  Order,  was  made  a  Doctor  by  the University  of  Paris,  and  thenceforward  taught and  wrote  brilliantly  and  successfully  all  his life  long.  He  died  at  Fossanova,  near  Toulouse, a.d.  1274,  and  was  canonised  a.d.  1323.  His works  on  Theology  and  Philosophy  are  voluminous, and  have  been  again  and  again  republished. To his Metaphysical  system the 

Church  has  given  marked  preference.  The Summa  Theologica,  his  latest  and  unfortunately uncompleted  work,  is  that  on  which  his  reputation mainly  rests.  It  has  passed  through  numerous editions,  notwithstanding  its  bulk,  and  deals with  the  whole  of  Catholic  dogma.  St.  Thomas was  a  Religious  of  most  holy  life.  His  devotion to  the  Sacrament  of  the  Altar  led  to  his  composing the  Office  and  Mass  of  Corpus  Christi, gems  of  the  Roman  Liturgy.  

♦THOMAS  FORDE  (Bl.)  M.  (May  28)  
(16th  cent.)  Born  in  Devonshire,  he  quitted the  University  of  Oxford  on  religious  grounds, and  was  ordained  priest  at  Douai.  After  ten years  of  zealous  work  on  the  English  mission, he  was  tried  for  his  life  and  suffered  martyrdom at  Tyburn,  A.D.  1582.  

♦THOMAS  COTTAM  (Bl.)  M.  (May  30)  
(16th  cent.)  A  native  of  Lancashire  who entered  the  Society  of  Jesus  in  Rome  and, returning  to  England,  was  put  to  death  at Tyburn  for  the  Faith  (a.d.  1582).  His  last words  were  expressions  of  charity  and  forgiveness to  all.  

♦THOMAS  WOODHOUSE  (Bl.)  M.  (June  19)  
(16th  cent.)  A  beneficed  priest  in  Lincolnshire in  the  time  of  Queen  Mary.  Refusing  to turn  Protestant  at  the  orders  of  her  unhappy sister  Elisabeth,  he  was  put  to  death  at  Tyburn (A.D.  1573).  He  had  been  admitted  into  the Society  of  Jesus  shortly  before  his  arrest.  

♦THOMAS  MORE  (Bl.)  M.  (July  6)  
(16th  cent.)  This  glorious  Martyr,  born  in London  (a.d.  1480),  on  leaving  Oxford  embraced the  Law  as  a  profession.  So  successful  was  he that  eventually  he  succeeded  Cardinal  Wolsey as  Lord  High  Chancellor  of  England,  being  the first  layman  called  to  that  office.  His  reputation was  European,  and  his  writings  were  distinguished alike  by  their  learning  and  their orthodoxy.  Faithful  to  his  conscience,  both  in regard  to  King  Henry's  divorce  and  to  the pretended  Royal  Supremacy,  he  at  length forfeited  the  favour  of  the  monarch,  whom nothing  less  than  his  death  could  appease. Blessed  Thomas  More  was  beheaded  on  Tower Hill,  July  6,  A.D.  1535.  His  body  was  buried in  the  Tower  ;  but  his  head  was  by  his  daughter placed  in  a  church  at  Canterbury.  Apart  from his  martyrdom,  his  piety,  charity,  constant cheerfulness  and  austere  virtue  might  well  have entitled  him  to  a  place  among  canonised  Saints.  

♦THOMAS  ABEL  (Bl.)  M.  (July  30)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Doctor  of  the  University  of Oxford,  a  priest  and  an  accomplished  Scholar. He  was  hanged  at  Smithfleld  (a.d.  1540)  for rejecting  the  pretended  Royal  Supremacy  in matters  of  religion,  and  for  opposing  the  Divorce of  Queen  Catharine.  

♦THOMAS  PERCY  (Bl.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  
(16th  cent.)  An  Earl  of  Northumberland, a  virtuous  nobleman,  steadfast  in  the  profession of  the  Catholic  Faith,  who,  on  his  life  being offered  him  on  condition  of  his  turning  Protestant, preferred  to  lose  it  for  Christ's  sake.  He was  beheaded  at  York,  Aug.  22,  a.d.  1572.  

♦THOMAS  TZUGI  and  OTHERS  (Sept 6)  
(Bl.)  MM.  

(17th  cent.)  Jesuit  Saints  who  were  burned to  death,  on  account  of  their  religion,  at  Nangasaki  in  Japan.  One  of  them,  Bl.  Michael Nacazaima,  like  the  rest  a  Japanese,  was  cast living  into  the  crater  of  a  volcano  on  Cliristmas Day,  A.D.  1627.  

THOMAS  of  VILLANOVA  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  18)  
(16th  cent.)  An  Augustinian  Friar  who became  Archbishop  of  Valencia  in  Spain. Distinguished  for  his  learning  and  piety,  he was  an  eloquent  and  zealous  preacher  ;  but  he is  chiefly  reverenced  for  his  love  of  the  poor. He  spent  his  whole  substance  in  alleviating  their distress.  He  died  at  Valencia  a.d.  1556,  and has  left  valuable  writings  on  Ascetic  and  Mystical Theology.  

R  257 

THOMAS 
THOMAS  of  HEREFORD  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  2)  
(13th  cent.)  An  Englishman,  son  of  the Baron  de  Cantelupe,  who  from  his  early  youth distinguished  himself  by  his  piety,  talents  and assiduity  in  his  studies.  After  a  brilliant career  at  Oxford  he  rose  to  be  Chancellor  of England ;  but,  eventually  consecrated  Bishop of  Hereford,  devoted  himself  entirely  to  his Pastoral  duties.  Austere  in  his  private  life, he  was  full  of  charity  and  kindliness  in  his dealings  with  his  neighbour.  Returning  from Rome,  whither  he  had  journeyed  on  the  business of  his  Church,  he  fell  ill  and  expired  at  Monteflascone  in  Tuscany  in  the  sixty-third  year  of his  age,  Aug.  25,  A.D.  1282.  He  was  canonised A.D.  1310.  

THOMAS  (St.)  (Nov.  18)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Syrian  monk,  to  whose prayers  the  people  of  Antioch  attributed  the cessation  of  a  pestilence  raging  in  their  city, and  whom  they  therefore  held  in  great  veneration while  living,  and  acclaimed  as  a  Saint  after his  death.  

♦THOMAS  of  DOVER  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  20)  
(13th  cent.) A  monk  of  austere  and  prayerful 
life,  murdered  by  pirates  about  A.D.  1295  for 
refusing  to  yield  up  to  them  the  treasures  of  a 
church  committed  to  his  charge.  

THOMAS  THE  APOSTLE  (St.)  (Dec.  21)  
(1st  cent.)  Otherwise  called  Didymus  (twin), one  of  the  Twelve.  His  doubt  about  the  reality of  Our  Lord's  Resurrection  and  his  being  summoned to  inspect  for  himself  the  marks  of  the Five  Wounds  in  the  Body  of  Jesus,  in  the opinion  of  the  Fathers,  rendered  invaluable service  to  Christianity.  After  the  Ascension, he  is  stated  to  have  preached  the  Gospel  in Parthia  ;  and  a  very  generally  accepted  tradition makes  him  the  Apostle  of  the  Indies, where  he  is  said  to  have  suffered  martyrdom. The  so-called  "Christians  of  St.  Thomas"  in India  may  be  descendants  of  his  converts ; but  they  have  long  since  lapsed  from  the  true Faith  and  are  now  Nestorian  heretics.  

THOMAS  of  CANTERBURY  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Dec.  29) (12th  cent.)  St.  Thomas  A'Becket,  born  in London  Dec.  21,  a.d.  1118,  was  first  educated at  Merton  Abbey,  whence  he  passed  to  the University  of  Paris.  Though  he  had  fair prospects  in  lay-life,  he  embraced  the  Ecclesiastical state  at  the  age  of  twenty-three,  and was  ordained  deacon  by  Archbishop  Theobald (A.D.  1154).  Soon  after,  with  the  favour  of King  Henry  II,  he  rose  to  the  high  office  of Chancellor  of  the  Realm.  So  well  did  he  acquit himself  of  his  charge  that,  at  the  death  of Archbishop  Theobald,  he  was  promoted  to  the Archbishopric  of  Canterbury  (a.d.  1162),  the King  again  helping.  Nevertheless,  St.  Thomas was  constrained  to  spend  the  remaining  eight years  of  his  life  in  resisting  the  unjust  encroachments of  the  monarch  on  the  liberties  of  the Church.  He  was  soon  driven  into  banishment into  France,  and  (a  short  reconciliation  between him  and  Henry  having  been  brought  about) only  returned  to  Canterbury  to  be  attacked, with  the  King's  connivance,  in  his  own  Cathedral, by  four  knights,  and  brutally  slain  at  the foot  of  the  Altar  (Dec.  29,  A.D.  1170).  Popular feeling  was  wholly  with  the  Martyr,  who  was canonised  as  early  as  a.d.  1173.  King  Henry was  forced  to  do  public  penance  for  his  crime  ; and  the  Martyr's  shrine  at  Canterbury  became the  most  frequented  place  of  pilgrimage  in England,  and  remained  so  until  the  change  of religion  in  the  sixteenth  century.  

♦THOMIAN  (TOIMAN,  THOMENUS)  (Jan.  10) (St.)  Bp.  

(7th  cent.)  The  seventeenth  Archbishop  of Armagh,  to  which  See  his  great  reputation  for sanctity  of  life  had  caused  him  to  be  unanimously elected.  He  died  about  A.D.  660.

THRASEAS  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Oct.  5)  
(2nd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Eumenia  in  Phry
gia,  praised  by  contemporary  Fathers  as  "  a 
great  light  of  the  Church." He  appears  to  have 
suffered  martyrdom  at  Smyrna  about  a.d.  170, 
but  we  have  no  further  particulars.  

THRASILLA  (St.)  (Dec.  24)  

Otherwise  St.  THARSILLA,  which  see. THYRSUS  and  PROJECTUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  24) (Date  unknown.)  Who  these  Martyrs  were is  now  quite  undiscoverable.  There  is  a theory  that  the  one  and  the  other  are  identical with  other  Saints  of  these  names  elsewhere inserted  in  the  Roman  Martyrology,  and  that the  double  insertion  was  purposely  made  for some  reason  unknown  to  us.  However,  there would  be  nothing  surprising  in  the  fact,  if  it could  be  shown  that  these  Christians  were  two among  the  victims  of  one  of  the  persecutions, and  that  their  bare  names  were  all  that  the Church  Officials  could  ever  ascertain.  For example,  in  such  fearful  periods  of  persecution as  the  opening  years  of  the  fourth  century, when  the  mere  being  a  Christian  was  a capital  offence  and  the  possessing  a  Christian manuscript  an  act  of  treason,  the  registering of  the  Passions  of  Martyrs  must  have  been reduced  to  the  taking  of  the  barest  memoranda. It  is,  indeed,  wonderful  that  so  many  names have  come  down  to  our  time. THYRSUS  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  31)

(SS.)  MM.  (April  14)  
(3rd  cent.) Roman  Martyrs, famous  from 
their  association  with  St.  Cecilia,  who  had  been 
betrothed  to  St.  Valerian.  He  and  his  brother 
St.  Tiburtius,  Roman nobles,  were converted 
to  Christianity  by  St.  Cecilia  and  baptised  by 
Pope  St.  Urban  I.  They  were  put  to  death  on 
account  of  their  religion  in  the  reign  of  the 
Emperor Alexander Severus (a.d. 229), and 
with  them  one  of  their  gaolers,  St.  Maximus, 
who  had  of  his  own  accord  declared  himself  to 
be,  like  them,  a  believer  in  Christ.  

TIBURTIUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  11)  
(3rd cent.) The son of a highly placed 
Official  in  the  Imperial  Court  in  Rome  who, 
accused  of  being  a  Christian,  was  put  upon  his 
trial,  sentenced  and  beheaded  outside  the  walls 
of  the  City,  at  the  beginning  of  the  reign  of 
Diocletian  (A.D.  286).

Otherwise  St.  TIGERNACH,  which  see. "TIGERNACH (TIGERNAKE, TIERNEY, 
TIERRY)  (St.)  Bp.  (April  4)  
(6th  cent.)  An  Irishman,  stated  to  have been  a  disciple  of  Menennius  in  Britain  (that  is, probably,  of  St.  Ninian  in  Strathclyde).  He was  Bishop  of  Clogher  and  Clones  in  his  own country,  and  died  about  a.d.  550.  He  appears to  have  lost  his  eyesight  in  his  old  age,  and thenceforth  to  have  devoted  his  whole  time  to prayer  and  heavenly  contemplation.  But  the traditions  concerning  him  are  very  various. TIGIDES  and  REMEDIUS  (SS.)  Bps.  (Feb.  3) (Date  unknown.)  Two  Bishops  who  succeeded one  another  in  the  See  of  Gap  (French Alps)  soon  after  Christianity  had  penetrated into  that  part  of  Gaul.  No  particulars  regarding them  are  now  to  be  found. 
TOLA 

TIGRIUS  and  EUTROPIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Jan.  12) (5th  cent.)  Tigrius  was  a  priest  at  Constantinople, but  said  to  have  been  of  Barbarian descent.  Eutropius  was  a  Lector  or  Reader in  a  church  of  the  same  city.  Both  were staunch  adherents  of  St.  John  Chrysostom ; and,  when  the  latter  was  banished  by  the Emperor  Arcadius,  were  falsely  accused  of incendiarism,  put  to  the  torture,  and  deported into  Asia.  They  seem  to  have  died  in  prison about  A.D.  405. *TILBERT  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  7)  

Otherwise St. GILBERT.  See SS. ALCHMUND  and  GILBERT. "TILBERT  (GILBERT)  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  2)

He  was  venerated  in  life  as  well as  after  his  death  (a.d.  789)  as  a  Saint. TIMOLAUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  24) (4th cent.)  Sufferers under Diocletian at Csesarea  in  Palestine  (a.d.  305). These  Christians  were eight  in  number ; and Eusebius gives  the  name  of  each.  Two  of  them  were Egyptians,  the  rest  Asiatics  of  various provinces. They voluntarily denounced themselves as  Christians  to  the  Imperial  Officials, and  were  all  beheaded  on  the  same  day. TIMON  (St.)  M.  (April  19)  
(1st  cent.)  One  of  the  First  Seven  Deacons, chosen  by  the  Apostles  (Acts  vi.  5).  One tradition  makes  St.  Timon  to  have  been  one of  the  seventy-two  disciples  sent  before  Him by  Christ  Himself  (Luke  x.) ;  another  adds that  he  afterwards  became  Bishop  of  Bostra. The  Roman  Martyrology  describes  St.  Timon as  having  first  preached  at  Bercea,  then  to have  been  made  Bishop  of  Corinth,  and  finally to  have  been  crucified  by  the  Jews  and  Pagans of  that  city. TIMOTHY  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Jan.  24)  
(First  cent.)  The  beloved  disciple  of  the Apostle  St.  Paul,  who  ordained  him  Bishop  of Ephesus  in  Asia  Minor  and  addressed  to  him two  of  the  New  Testament  Epistles.  About the  year  a.d.  97,  or  perhaps  earlier,  the  infuriated worshippers  of  the  great  idol,  "  Diana  of the  Ephesians,"  stoned  the  holy  Bishop  to death. TIMOTHY  (St.)  M.  (March  24)  

See  SS.  MARK  and  TIMOTHY. TIMOTHY  and  DIOGENES  (SS.)  MM. (April  6) (4th  cent.) Martyrs  in  Macedonia,  probably victims  of  the  persecuting  spirit  of  the  dominant Arian  faction  (a.d.  345). TIMOTHY  and  MAURA  (SS.)  MM.  (May  3)  
(3rd  cent.)  An  Egyptian  Christian  and  his wife,  crucified  in  the  Thebais  (Upper  Egypt) about  A.D.  286,  on  St.  Timothy's  refusal  (he being  a  Lector  or  Reader)  to  deliver  up  the Sacred  Books  which  the  Pagan  authorities  were bent  upon  having  destroyed. TIMOTHY,  POLIUS  and  EUTYCHIUS  (May  21) (SS.)  MM.

(4th  cent.)  Three  Palestinian  Christians who  were  done  to  death  at  Gaza  under  Diocletian at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century.  Timothy was  burned  at  the  stake,  Thecla  thrown  to  the wild  beasts  in  the  Amphitheatre,  and  Agapius, *  a  little  time  afterwards,  cast  into  the  sea  to drown.

TIMOTHY  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  Roman  Martyr  venerated from  ancient  times  throughout  the Catholic  Church.  It  is  stated  that  after  a  long imprisonment  and  a  savage  scourging  he  was beheaded  outside  the  Walls  of  Rome,  near  the site  of  the  great  Basilica  of  St.  Paul,  in  which his  relics  have  been  enshrined.  The  opinion generally  accepted  is  that  he  suffered  under Diocletian,  that  is,  about  A.D.  300.  The Lection  in  the  Roman  Breviary  adopts  this view,  and  moreover  qualifies  St.  Timothy  as  a Syrian  from  Antioch.  

TIMOTHY  and  APOLLINARIS  (SS.)  MM.  (Aug.  23) (Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  at  Rheims  in France.  The  old  belief  was  that  they  were  of Apostolic  times  and  that  they  suffered  for Christ  before  a.d.  100  ;  but  it  is  now  generally accepted  that  they  flourished  some  two  hundred years  later.  

TIMOTHY  and  FAUSTUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  8) (Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  registered  as having  suffered  at  Antioch  in  Syria,  but  of  whom we  have  now  no  particulars.  

TIMOTHY  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  19)  
(Date  unknown.)  An  African  Martyr  who perished  at  the  stake,  but  whose  Acts  have  long since  been  lost.  

TITIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  16)  
(7th  cent.)  For  thirty  years  a  Bishop  in  the neighbourhood  of  Venice,  whose  city  (Opitergium  or  Oderzo)  has  since  been  destroyed. Many  miracles  are  attributed  to  his  intercession, both  wrought  by  him  in  life  and  at  his tomb  after  his  death  (a.d.  650).  

TITIAN  (St.)  Bp.  (March  3)  
(6th cent.) A  Bishop  of  Brescia  in  Lombardy, 
by  birth  a  German.  He  was  conspicuous  for  his 
charity  to  the  poor  and  the  worker  of  many 
miracles.  He  died  A.D.  536.  

TITUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  4)  
(1st  cent.)  The  favoured  disciple  of  St.  Paul, to  whom  the  Apostle  addressed  an  Epistle included  in  the  New  Testament,  and  whom  he consecrated  first  Bishop  of  the  Island  of  Crete. St.  Titus  passed  away,  full  of  merits,  about  the close  of  the  first  century,  being  then,  it  is  said, in  his  ninety-fourth  year.  Some  allege  that  he survived  until  A.D.  105.  

TITUS  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  16)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Roman  deacon  who,  when  the city  was  sacked  by  the  Goths,  strove  to  succour the  defenceless  inhabitants  and  in  consequence himself  fell  a  victim  to  the  fury  of  the  Barbarian invaders  (A.d.  410).  The  name  of  this  St. Titus  was  first  inserted  ;in  the  Roman  Martyrology at  the  time  it  was  re-edited  by  Cardinal Baronius.  It  is  not  clear  that  St.  Titus  died during  the  sack  of  Rome,  though  it  must  be conceded  that  he  ended  a3  a  Martyr,  probably a  victim  in  one  of  the  frequent  massacres perpetrated  by  the  savages  who  were  overrunning Italy  at  the  period.  For,  his  contemporary, the  careful  writer  St.  Prosper  of Aquitaine,  dates  the  death  of  the  holy  deacon (giving  the  years  of  the  Emperors)  at  a.d.  425  ; and  it  would  even  seem  that  not  in  Rome,  but elsewhere  in  Italy,  he  lost  his  life,  for  it  was near  Milan  that  his  relics  were  enshrined.

LETIUS, HESYCHIUS and EUPHRASIUS 
(SS.)  Bps.  (May  15)  
(1st  cent.)  The  seven  disciples  (Italians  and Greeks)  consecrated  Bishops  by  the  Apostles, and  sent  as  missionaries  into  Spain.  There St.  Torquatus  fixed  his  See  at  Cadiz,  and  each one  of  the  others  in  some  principal  city.  Their work  was  blessed  by  God  and  they  made  many converts  to  Christianity.

He  is  said  to  have been  converted  to  the  Christian  Faith  by  the famous  Martyr  St.  Sebastian,  and,  discovered to  be  a  Christian,  because  found  praying  over the  tomb  of  St.  Paul  the  Apostle  outside  the Walls  of  Bome,  to  have  been  stoned  to  death (A.D.  286),  most  likely  by  a  Pagan  mob. TRASON,  PONTIUS  and  PR^TEXTATUS  (Dec.ll)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Boman  Christians  who,  under Diocletian,  devoted  themselves  to  relieving  the wants  of  their  brethren  in  prison.  They  were rewarded  for  their  charity  by  receiving  the crown  of  martyrdom  in  one  of  the  first  years of  the  fourth  century. *TREA  (St.)  V.  (Aug.  3)

She  is  said  afterwards  to  have  led  the  life  of  a Becluse  in  Forfarshire.  Bestalrig,  her  shrine, was  a  noted  place  of  pilgrimage  in  Catholic times. *TRIEN  (TRIENAN)  (St.)  Abbot,  (March  22)  
(5th  cent.)  One  of  St.  Patrick's  disciples. He  became  Abbot  of  Killelga,  and  was  closely allied  with  St,  Mochteus  Ingmagh. *TRILLO  (DRILLO)  (St.)  (June  13)

He attended  the  Council  of  Sardica  (a.d.  347). He  was  a  writer  and  as  such  is  praised  by  St. Jerome.  He  died  about  A.D.  370. TRIPOS  (St.)  M.  (June  10)  

See  SS.  BASILIDES,  TBIPOS, &c. TROADUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  28)

He  was  reverenced  as  a  Saint  even  before his  death,  and  was  favoured  by  Almighty  God with  heavenly  visions  and  with  the  gift  of prophecy. TRON  (TROND)  (St.)  (Nov.  23)  

Otherwise  St.  TRUDO,  which  see. TROPHIMUS  and  THALUS  (SS.)  MM. (March  11)  
(4th  cent.) Christians  of  Laodicea  in  Asia 
Minor, crucified for their Faith under the 
Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, about 
A.D.  300.  

TROPHIMUS  and  EUCARPIUS  (March  18)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.)  Two  Pagan  soldiers  who,  ordered by  their  officers  to  hunt  out  and  seize  Christians, were  themselves  miraculously  converted  to  the Faith  of  Christ.  Having  publicly  avowed  their belief,  they  Avere  burned  to  death  at  the  stake at  Nicomedia,  at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth century. TROPHIMUS  and  THEOPHILUS  (July  23)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(4th cent.) Two Christians, beheaded in Bome on account of their religion, under Diocletian,  about  A.D.  302. TROPHIMUS, SABBATIUS and DORYMEDON 
(SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  19)  
(3rd  cent.) Asiatic  Martyrs  under  the  Emperor Probus  (A.D.  277,  about).  They  were  put to  the  torture  and  beheaded  as  Christians,  most probably  at  Antioch,  the  Syrian  metropolis. TROPHIMUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  29)  
(1st  cent.)  The  Ephesian  Christian  of  that name,  several  times  mentioned  in  the  New Testament  (Acts  xx.  4  ;  xxi.  29  ;  2  Tim.  iv.  20). He  is  said  to  have  been  consecrated  a  Bishop by  St.  Paul  and  sent  as  a  missionary  into  Gaul, where  he  founded  the  See  of  Aries.  That  the St.  Trophimus,  first  Bishop  of  Aries,  who spread  Christianity  in  the  South-East  of  Gaul is  only  a  namesake  of  the  disciple  of  St.  Paul, and  that  he  lived  two  centuries  later,  is  a  view upheld  by  not  a  few  moderns.  Nevertheless, the  tradition  as  above  stated  dates  from  the earliest  times,  and  contains  nothing  that  can be  called  improbable.  St.  Paul  had  made  up his  mind  to  go  himself  to  Spain  (Bom.  xv.  24, 28).  It  is  scarcely  likely  that  the  South  of Gaul  (with  which  communications  were  of  the easiest)  would  be  neglected ;  and  the  choosing of  his  trusted  confidant,  Trophimus,  for  the work  to  be  done  seems  natural  enough. 
TYDECHO 

TRUDO  (St.)  (Nov.  23)  
(7th  cent.) A  Belgian  Saint  who  founded  a 
monastery  near  Liege. He  was  a  disciple  of 
St.  Clodoald  of  Metz,  and  a  man  of  austere 
sanctity. He  died  A.D.  693.  

♦TRUDPERT  (St.)  M.  (April  16)  
(7th  cent.)  The  brother  of  St.  Rupert  and his  companion  in  his  mission  to  the  Pagans  of Germany.  St.  Trudpert  eventually  retired  to a  hermitage,  where  he  was  murdered  under circumstances  which  were  deemed  such  as  to justify  the  honouring  his  memory  as  that  of  a Martvr. *TRUMWIN  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  5)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon  Saint.  He  was consecrated  Bishop  by  St.  Theodore  of  Canterbury in  order  that  he  might  engage  in  missionary work  among  the  Picts.  His  path  in  life seems  to  have  been  one  of  toil  and  pain  above the  ordinary.  He  had  repeatedly  to  fly  from province  to  province,  being  often  misunderstood and  driven  off  his  field  of  work.  He  was  a  great friend  and  supporter  of  St.  Cuthbert.  In  the end  he  retired  to  Whitby,  and  there  ministered to  the  spiritual  needs  of  the  holy  community of  nuns  presided  over  by  St.  Elfleda.  St. Trumwin  went  to  his  reward  in  one  of  the  first years  of  the  eighth  century. TRYPHENNA  and  TRYPHOSA  (SS.)  (Nov.  10)  
(First  cent.)  The  Christians  mentioned  by St.  Paul  in  writing  to  the  Romans  (xvi.  12). They  were,  it  would  seem,  of  Iconium  in Lycaonia,  and  had  settled  in  Rome,  where perhaps  they  discharged  the  duties  of  deaconesses. Tradition  represents  them  as  protectresses of  the  virgin  St.  Thecla. TRYPHON  (St.)  M.  (Jan.  4)  

See  SS.  AQUILINUS,  GEMINUS,  &c. TRYPHON  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  3)  
(Date  unknown.) A  group  of  thirteen 
Egyptian  Martyrs,  put  to  death  at  Alexandria, 
as  Christians.  Nothing  more  concerning  them 
has  come  down  to  us.  

TRYPHON,  RESPICIUS  and  NYMPHA (Nov.  10)  
(SS.)  MM.  

(3rd  cent.)  SS.  Tryphon  and  Respicius  were Asiatic  Christians,  put  to  death  at  Nicsea  under Decius  (A.D.  250).  For  some  reason  now unknown  to  us,  they  were  held  in  special veneration  both  in  Rome  and  at  Constantinople. Who  St.  Nympha  was  it  is  hard  to  say  ;  but  the fact  that  from  very  early  times  her  relics  were enshrined  in  the  church  of  St.  Tryphon  in  Rome has  led  to  her  sharing  the  festival  of  the  other two  holy  Martyrs. TRYPHONIA  (St.)  Widow.  (Oct.  18)  
(3rd  cent.)  Supposed  to  have  been  the Christian  wife  of  the  persecuting  Emperor Decius.  But  the  best  authorities  are  content to  describe  her  as  a  Roman  widow  who  by  her holiness  of  life  merited  to  be  venerated  as  a Saint. TRYPHOSA  (St.)  (Nov.  10)  

See  SS.  TRYPHENA  and  TRYPHOSA. *TUDA  (St.)  Bp.  (Oct.  21)  
(7th  cent.)  An  Irish  Saint  who  came  over  to Northumbria  and  succeeded  St.  Colman  in  the See  of  Lindisfarne.  He  was  a  zealous  supporter of  the  Roman  practice  in  regard  to  the  date  of Easter.  He  was  a  man  of  ability  and  of  holy life,  promising  a  useful  Episcopate ;  but  unhappily a  pestilence  then  raging  carried  him off  in  the  very  first  year  of  his  government  of the  Diocese  (a.d.  664).  It  is  not  certain  that he  ever  enjoyed  the  honour  of  a  public  cultus. TUDE  (St.)  (June  25)  

Otherwise  St.  ANTIDIUS,  which  see. *TUDINUS  (St.)  Abbot.  (May  9)

♦TUDY  (TYBIE,  TYDIE)  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  30)

♦TUDY  (TEGWYN)  (St.)  (May  11)  
(5th  cent.)  A  disciple  of  St.  Mawes  (Maudez) who  like  the  latter  lived  somewhere  in  Cornwall, but  is  chieflv  venerated  in  Brittany.  

♦TUGDUAL  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  30)  
(6th  cent.)  Like  his  brother,  St.  Lenorius, a  prince  of  the  Royal  House  of  Brittany,  but born  in  Great  Britain.  After  some  years  of monastic  life  he  became  Bishop  of  Treguier, where  he  died  a.d.  564,  and  has  ever  since  been held  in  veneration  as  a  great  Saint.  

TURIAF  (TURIANUS)  (St.)  Bp.  (July  13)  
(8th  cent.) A  Breton  Saint,  successor  in  the 
Episcopate  of  St.  Samson  of  Dol.  He  was  an

TURIBIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  27)  
(17th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Saint,  Archbishop  of Lima  in  Peru,  who  by  his  indefatigable  zeal  and boundless  charity  literally  renewed  the  face  of the  Church  of  Peru.  He  died  March  23,  A.D. 1606.  

♦TURNINUS  (St.)  (July  17)  
(8th  cent.)  An  Irish  priest  who  worked  as  a missionary  with  St.  Foillan  in  the  Netherlands, and  more  particularly  in  the  vicinity  of  Antwerp.  

TWELVE  HOLY  BROTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  1) (3rd  cent.)  The  children  of  SS.  Boniface  and Thecla.  The  latter  were  African  Christians  who gave  their  lives  for  Christ  in  the  persecution under  Maximian  Herculeus,  and  are  venerated as  Martyrs  on  August  30.  Their  twelve  sons appear  to  have  been,  after  their  arrest,  taken  to Italy  to  be  tried  and  condemned  as  Christians. The  tradition  is  that  none  of  them  were  spared, but  no  reliable  account  of  their  martyrdom has  come  down  to  us.  The  relics  of  some  of these  Martyrs  are  enshrined  at  Benevento.  

♦TWYNNELL  (St.)  

This  occurs  as  a  place-name  in  Pembrokeshire. It  is  possibly  a  corrupt  form  of  the  name  St. WINNEUR  or  WINOC,  or  WINWALOE.

(5th  cent.)  A  Welsh  maiden  murdered  by Pagans.  Llandybie  church  perpetuates  her memory.

TYCHON  (St.)  Bp.  (June  16)  
(5th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  some  place  in  the Island  of  Cyprus,  held  in  great  veneration  in the  East.  He  was  conspicuous  for  his  destestation  of  idolatry  and  for  his  care  for  and  sympathy with  the  poor.  He  must  have  died  before A.D.  450.  

♦TYDECHO  (St.)  (Dec.  17)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Welsh  Saint,  brother  of  St. Cadfan.  He  and  his  sister  fixed  their  abode  in Merionethshire.  Several  churches  are  dedicated in  his  honour,  but  we  have  no  particulars  of his  life

TYDFIL  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  28)  
( 5th  cent. )  The  daughter  of  a  Welsh  chieftain and  wife  of  a  man  of  her  own  rank.  She  with others  (about  a.d.  460)  fell  victims  to  the savage  fury  of  marauding  Picts  and  Saxons  at a  place  still  called  after  her,  Merthyr  Tydfil.  

TYRANNIO,  SILVANUS,  PELEUS,  NILUS  and ZENOBIUS  (SS.)  MM.  (Feb.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  These  are  the  most  prominent among  a  multitude  of  Christians,  men,  women and  children,  done  to  death  on  account  of  their religion  at  Tyre  in  Phoenicia  in  the  first  years of  the  fourth  century.  The  four  first  named were  Bishops,  and  Zenobius  was  a  priest. Of  the  others,  the  Martyrology  quaintly  says that  God  alone  knows  how  many  there  were  in all.  Fierce  tortures  and  strange  forms  of torture,  horribly  varied,  carried  them  off. Praying  for  their  murderers,  they  fell  asleep  in Christ.  

♦TYSSILO  (TYSSEL)  (St.)  (Nov.  8)  
(6th  cent.;  A  Saint  of  the  great  Welsh House  of  Cunedda  from  which  sprang  St.  David, St.  Teilo  and  other  famous  and  holy  men. St.  Tyesel  is  the  Title  Saint  of  several  churches, but  trustworthy  details  of  his  life  are  lacking.

A  German,  educated  in  the monastery  of  St.  Gall  in  Switzerland,  and  made Bishop  of  Augsburg  (a.d.  924)  at  a  time  when inroads  of  Barbarians  were  laying  the  country desolate.

(11th  cent.)  The  successor,  after  two  short intermediate  Pontificates,  of  St.  Gregory  VII (A.D.  1087).  As  Pope  he  adopted  as  his  own  the policy  of  his  sainted  predecessor.  He  was  the "  Peacemaker  "  of  the  period,  but  is  perhaps best  known  because  of  his  zealous  promoting of  the  First  Crusade.  He^died  a.d.  1099.

URBAN  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  7)  
(4th  cent.) A  Bishop  of  Theano  or  Chieti,

Urged  by St.  Bridget  of  Sweden  and  by  St.  Catherine  of Siena,  he  resolved  on  putting  an  end  to  this abnormal  condition  of  things,  and  entered Rome  in  triumph  (a.d.  1367).  Soon  after, however,  he  was  forced  to  return  to  France, where  he  died,  clad  in  the  habit  of  his  Order (Dec.  16,  A.D.  1370).

A.D.  67  is  usually  given as  the  date  of  his  death.  

URSICINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  24)

denounced  as  a  Christian  and  put  to  death  on

URSINUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  9; 
(3rd  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Bourges  in France,  to  which  city  he  was  sent  by  the  Pope of  the  time.  No  particulars  concerning  him are  available,  and  the  date  of  his  Episcopate is  still  a  matter  of  discussion.

(3rd  cent.)  Reckoned  as  the  seventh  Bishop of  Pavia  in  Lombardy ,  and  said  to  have  governed that  Church  from  a.d.  183  to  a.d.  216.

URSULA  and  HER  COMPANIONS  (Oct.  21)  
(SS.)  VV.MM.  

(5th  cent.)  The  tradition  concerning  these Saints  is  that  when  the  Britons  fled  from  the South  of  England  before  the  invading  Saxons, while  many  took  refuge  in  Armorica  (Bretagne), others  fled  to  the  Continental  shores  about  the mouth  of  the  Rhine,  but  were  there  done  to death  by  the  heathen  Huns,  then  ravaging  the country.  They  are  reputed  to  have  numbered many  thousands  (11,000,  according  to  the Mediaeval  legend).  That  a  Princess  or  chieftain's daughter,  Ursula  by  name,  was  their leader  is  generally  accepted ;  but  other  details are  quite  uncertain.  Their  shrine  in  one  of  the churches  of  Cologne  (with  its  vast  collection  of their  bones)  is  celebrated  all  over  the  Christian world.  The  Mediaeval  belief  that  all  these Martyrs  were  young  girls  need  not  be  insisted upon.  

URSUS  (St.)  Bp.  (April  13)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Ravenna  who  died In  great  fame  of  sanctity  A.D.  396.

(6th  cent.) A  hermit  who  dwelt  for  many 
years  in  a  cell  near  the  Cathedral  of  Auxerre

the  miracles  witnessing  to  it,  was  made  Bishop of  that  city. He  died  at  the  age  of  eighty-one, A.D.  508. URSUS  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  30)  

See  SS.  VICTOR  and  URSUS.  

♦UST  (JUSTUS)  (St.)  (Aug.  12)  
(Date  unknown.) This  Saint,  who  gives  its 
title  to  the  church  of  St.  Just  a  few  miles  from 
Penzance, it is impossible satisfactorily to 
identify.  Indeed  it  is  likely  that  there  were 
two  or  more  Saints  of  the  same  name  in  Brittany, 
Wales  and  Cornwall. They  would  be  of  the 
fifth  or  at  the  latest  of  the  sixth  century.  But 
all  the  accounts  given  of  them  are  imperfect 
and  unsatisfactory. We  find  St.  Just  described 
sometimes  as  a  hermit, sometimes  as  a  Martyr, 
sometimes  even  as  a  Bishop.

Otherwise  St.  VEDASTUS,  which  see.  

VALENS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (May  21)  
(Date  unknown.)  Nothing  has  come  down to  us  concerning  this  St.  Valens,  except  that  he was  a  Bishop  and  suffered  death  for  Christ  in the  early  years  of  the  Church.  Tradition  adds that  with  him  were  put  to  death  three  Christian youths  or  children.  

VALENS,  PAUL  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  1) (4th  cent.)  Eusebius,  St.  Jerome  and  other writers  describe  at  length  the  Passion  of  these Saints  (a.d.  309),  victims  with  St.  Pamphilus in  Palestine,  during  the  last  great  persecution, of  the  Pagan  hatred  of  Christianity.  Valens, a  deacon  of  the  Church  of  Jerusalem  and  a venerable  old  man,  is  said  to  have  been  able  to repeat  the  whole  Bible  by  heart.  

VALENS  (St.)  Bp.  (July  26)  
(6th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Verona  who  occupied that  See  from  a.d.  524  to  a.d.  531.  Particulars are  lacking  concerning  him.

He  was  beheaded  as  a  Christian  about  a.d.  270. But  modern  research  has  raised  many  doubts about  the  genuineness  of  the  tradition  concerning hiin.  The  custom  of  sending  so-called "  Valentines  "  on  Feb.  14  has  no  connection with  the  history  of  the  Saint,  but  is  probably of  Pagan  origin.  

VALENTINE  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Feb.  14)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Terni,  or  perhaps  of Teramo,  in  Italy,  who  suffered  martyrdom  in the  same  persecution  as  the  priest  St.  Valentine of  Rome,  though  it  would  seem  two  or  three years  later.  

VALENTINE  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (July  16)  
(4th  cent.)  The  Roman  Martyrology  describes him  as  Bishop  of  Treves  ;  but,  no  such name  occurring  in  the  lists  of  the  Prelates  of that  See,  a  very  likely  opinion  now  identifies him  with  a  St.  Valentine,  Bishop  of  Tongres, who  suffered  martyrdom  at  the  beginning  of the  fourth  century.

(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Ravenna  in  Italy  in the  persecution  under  Diocletian,  whom  it  is difficult  to  distinguish  from  the  group  honoured there  on  Nov.  11,  as  we  have  no  records  to  guide us  in  the  research. VALENTINE, CONCORDIUS,  NAVALIS  and 
AGRICOLA  (SS.)  MM.  (Dec.  16)  
(4th  cent.)  Martyrs  at  Ravenna  in  Italy. Valentine,  an  officer  in  the  Imperial  army,  the father  of  Concordius,  was  converted  to  Christianity by  St.  Dalmatius  of  Pavia.

(June  5)  

See  SS.  ZENAIDES,  CYRIO, &c. VALERIA  (St.)  V.M.  (Dec.  9)  
(First  cent.)  The  tradition  concerning  her is  that  she  was  of  a  noble  Gallo-Roman  family of  Limoges  (France),  that  she  was  converted  by St.  Martial,  first  Bishop  of  that  city,  and  that she  was  beheaded  as  a  Christian.  If,  as  is  the modern  view,  the  Apostolate  of  St.  Martial  be postdated  to  the  third  century,  a  similar  change of  date  must  be  made  for  St.  Valeria. VALERIAN  (St.)  M.

He  did  also  good  work  in reforming  the  discipline  of  his  clergy  and  in stirring  up  his  people  to  fervour  in  the  practice of  virtue.  He  died  a.d.  388.

thereafter  he  perished  of  want  in  the  open country  near  the  African  city  which  had  been his  Episcopal  See  (a.d.  456).  

VALERIUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  28)  
(4th  cent.)  A  zealous  prelate  of  Saragossa in  Spain,  imprisoned  and  exiled  in  the  persecution under  Diocletian.  Surviving,  however, many  trials,  he  returned  to  die  in  peace  in  his Episcopal  city  (a.d.  315).

priest  who  passed  his  life  in  penance  and  prayer

(4th  cent.) A  victim  of  the  persecution  under Diocletian  at  Braga  in  Portugal.  He  was  only a  catechumen  when  arrested  as  a  Christian, and,  being  almost  at  once  beheaded,  was  baptised in  his  own  blood  (a.d.  300  about). VICTOR, ZOTICUS, ZENO, ACINDYNUS, CJESAREUS,  SEVERIANUS,  CHRYSOPHORUS, THEONAS  and  ANTONY  (SS.)  MM.  (April  20) (4th  cent.)

(2nd  cent.)  A  Syrian  Christian  and  his  wife, put  to  death  in  Syria  because  of  their  religion about  a.d.  176.

He  practically settled  the  disputes  about  the  right  date of  Easter,  which  caused  so  much  trouble  in  the Early  Church ;  and  various  useful  disciplinary reforms  are  attributed  to  him.  He  passed  away a.d.  197. VICTOR  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  23)  
(6th  cent.)  A  learned  African  Bishop,  whose See  (whence  his  distinguishing  name,  Vitensis) was  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Tunis.  In  the persecution  set  on  foot  by  the  Arian  Vandals he  was  banished,  and  died  in  exile  in  the  Island of  Sardinia  shortly  after  a.d.  500.  The History  of  the  Vandalic  Persecution  he  has  left us  is  of  considerable  value. VICTOR  (St.)  M.  (Aug.  26)  
(10th  cent.)  A  Spanish  Saint  who,  after living  many  years  a  hermit's  life  in  the  neighbourhood of  Burgos,  at  the  command  of  an Angel,  betook  himself  to  the  camp  of  the  Moors, then  besieging  his  native  town  of  Cereza,  and sought  to  preach  Christianity  to  them.  He made  some  converts,  but  was  in  the  end  seized and  crucified  (a.d.  950).  The  Moors,  however, abandoned  their  siege. VICTOR  (St.)  Bp.  M.  (Sept.  10)

He  has  ever  been  in great  veneration  throughout  the  Church  of Christ ;  and  St.  Leo  the  Great  with  others  of the  Fathers  are  loud  in  his  praises.  The Spanish  Christian  poet  Prudentius  has  left  us Hymns  composed  in  his  honour.

VINCENT  FERRER  (St.)  (April  5)  
(15th  cent.)  A  Spaniard,  born  at  Valentia, and  one  of  the  glories  of  the  Dominican  Order. He  travelled  over  almost  all  Europe  preaching and  winning  souls  to  God.  He  was  one  of  the instruments  chosen  by  Almighty  God  for putting  an  end  to  the  Great  Schism,  which divided  the  Church  into  parties,  acknowledging the  jurisdiction  of  rival  Popes.  He  had  the gifts  of  prophecy  and  of  tongues,  and  worked many  miracles,  even  raising  the  dead  to  life. He  died  at  Vannes  in  Brittany,  a.d.  1419.

Being  of great  ability  he  occupied  himself  in  writing  on the  Church  controversies  of  his  time.  His  book, called  the  Commonitorium,  is  constantly  cited, even  in  our  own  day,  and  is  undoubtedly  a work  of  real  value.  St.  Vincent  died  in  his monastery,  a.d.  450.  

VINCENT  (St.)  M.  (June  9)  
(3rd  cent.)  There  is  some  confusion  in  the records  between  this  St.  Vincent  and  the  much better  known  Spanish  Martyr  honoured  on Jan.  22.  But  it  seems  clear  that  the  former was  a  Saint  of  Agen  in  the  South  of  France, and  that  he  there  gave  his  life  for  Christ  about A.d.  273,  some  thirty  years  before  the  Passion of  St.  Vincent  of  Spain.

His  first  great missionary  work  was  among  the  Moorish  pirates in  Barbary,  whither  he  had  been  conveyed  as  a prisoner.  Escaping,  he  became  a  veritable Apostle  in  his  native  country,  bringing  innumerable souls  back  to  God.  His  most  lasting  works on  earth  were  the  Congregation  of  Lazarist Missionaries  and  that  of  the  universally  valued Sisters  of  Charity.  He  died  at  Paris,  Sept.  27, A.D.  1660,  and  was  canonised  A.d.  1737  by  Pope Clement  XII.

Educated  at  Whitby  in  Yorkshire, while  that  Abbey  was  governed  by  St. Hilda,  St.  Wilfrid  attached  himself  to  St.  John of  Beverley,  whose  successor  at  York  he  became. He  retired  in  the  end  to  Ripon,  where  he  died a.d.  744.  In  the  accounts  of  the  translations  of his  relics  there  is  some  confusion  between  his own  and  those  of  his  far  more  celebrated predecessor  of  the  same  name  (Oct.  12).

Consecrated  Archbishop  of  York, he  sacrificed  himself  utterly  for  the  good  of his  flock.  He  was  more  than  once  banished from  his  country,  and  frequently  visited  Rome. Even  while  journeying,  he  preached  with  zeal and  success.  Hence,  he  is  venerated  as  one  of the  Apostles  of  Holland,  as  also  of  Sussex  and  of the  Isle  of  Wight.  He  entered  into  his  rest, April  24,  A.D.  709.  

WILGEFORTIS  (St.)  V.M.  (July  20)  
(Date  unknown.)  The  Roman  Martyrology describes  this  Portuguese  Saint  as  "  one  who, fighting  in  defence  of  her  Faith  and  of  her  virtue, earned  a  glorious  triumph  by  dying  on  a  cross." But  historians  find  it  impossible  to  identify  her, and  various  theories  about  her  are  current among  the  learned.  

♦WILGIS  (St.)  (Jan.  31)  
(7th  cent.)  The  father  of  St.  Willibrord,  the Apostle  of  Friesland.  Late  in  life,  St.  Wilgis became  a  hermit,  taking  up  his  abode  in  a  cell on  the  banks  of  the  Humber.  He  flourished  in the  latter  half  of  the  seventh  century,  and  we have  some  details  as  to  his  sanctity  from  the pen  of  the  celebrated  Alcuin.

Miracles succeeding  one  another  at  his  tomb  led  to  the venerating  of  him  as  a  Saint,  and  eventually  his remains  were  enclosed  in  a  costlv  shrine.  

WILLEHAD  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  8)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Northumbrian  Saint  who, inspired  by  the  example  of  St.  Boniface,  crossed over  into  Friesland  about  a.d.  772,  and  entered upon  an  extended  and  fruitful  Apostolate  in Germany.  He  was  the  first  missionary  to  pass the  Elbe.  Charlemagne,  having  conquered  the Saxons,  had  Willehad  consecrated  their  first Bishop.  The  See  of  Bremen  was  thus  founded. St.  Willehad  died  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Bremen, A.D.  789.  

WILLIAM  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  10)  
(13th  cent.)  A  French  Cistercian  monk  who became  Archbishop  of  Bourges  (a.d.  1199),  and died  A.D.  1209.  He  was  held  in  so  great  veneration as  to  have  been  canonised  less  than  eight years  after  his  passing  from  this  world.  

WILLIAM  of  MALEVAL  (St.)  (Feb.  10)  
(12th  cent.)  Apparently  by  birth  a  Frenchman.

He  had  extraordinary gifts  of  prayer,  prophecy,  and  the working  of  miracles,  and  practised  severe penance.  He  died  in  his  solitude  in  Tuscany, A.D.  1157.  An  Order  of  Bare-Footed  Friars, long  since  extinct,  honoured  him  as  their  model and  Patron  Saint.  

♦WILLIAM  of  ASSISI  (Bl.)  (March  7)  
(13th  cent.)  By  many  supposed  to  be  the "  Saint  Willyum,  a  preest  in  Englonde,"  commemorated in  the  "  Martiloge  "  on  March  2. Blessed  William  the  Englishman  was  one  of  the companions  of  St.  Francis  of  Assisi,  and  died  at Assisi  A.D.  1232.

(16th  cent.)  A  native  of  Somersetshire  who left  Oxford  for  Rheims  and  Rome,  where  he was  ordained  priest.  As  a  missionary  in England,  he  chiefly  evangelised  the  country round  York.  He  was  conspicuous  not  only  for his  zeal  and  piety,  but  also  for  his  tender kindness  to  the  poor  and  afflicted.  Convicted of  being  a  priest,  he  was  cruelly  done  to  death at  York,  A.D.  1583.  The  chronicles  of  the time  represent  the  bystanders  as  carefully gathering  up  relics  of  the  holy  Martyr.  

♦WILLIAM  (St.)  M.  (March  25)  
(12th  cent.)  One  of  the  boy-Martyrs  of  the Middle  JAges,  alleged  to  have  been  crucified by  Jews  out  of  hatred  of  Christianity.  The event  in  the  case  of  St.  William  took  place  at Norwich,  where  he  was  afterwards  the  object of  a  special  cultus.  

WILLIAM  of  ESKILL  (St.)  Abbot.  (April  6)  
(13th  cent.)  Born  in  Paris  (a.d.  1105)  and educated  at  St.  Germain-des-Pres  by  the  Abbot Hugh,  his  uncle,  he  became  a  Canon  of  St. Genevieve,  and  took  a  prominent  part  in  the reform  of  that  Chapter  (a.d.  1147).  He  afterwards founded  a  monastery  of  Canons  Regular at  Eskill  in  Denmark,  where  he  died,  full  of merits,  after  a  long  life  of  exterior  and  interior trials  (a.d.  1203).  He  was  canonised  (a.d.  1224) by  Pope  Honnorius  III.  

♦WILLIAM  (St.)  (May  10)  
(12th  cent.)  An  Englishman  by  birth,  who lived  a  saintly  life  at  Pontoise  in  France,  and whose  holy  death  (a.d.  1192)  was  followed  by many  miracles,  so  that  his  tomb  became  the resort  of  numerous  pious  pilgrims. 

♦WILLIAM  of  ROCHESTER  (St.)  M.  (May  23) (13th  cent.)  Said  to  have  been  a  native  of Perth  in  Scotland.  He  was  a  man  of  wonderful piety  and  charity,  but  was  set  upon  and  murdered while  on  a  pilgrimage  to  Canterbury. The  many  miracles  occurring  at  his  tomb justified  the  clergy  and  people  of  Rochester  in enshrining  his  remains  as  those  of  a  Saint  in their  Cathedral.  The  century  in  which  the holy  man  lived  is  somewhat  uncertain ;  but A.D.  1201  is  usually  assigned  as  the  date  of  his death.  

♦WILLIAM  FYLBY  (Bl.)  M.  (May  30)  
(16th  cent.)  William  Fylby  (Filbie),  a  native of  Oxford  and  member  of  the  University,  leaving England,  was  ordained  priest  at  Rheims.  He was  arrested  shortly  after  his  return  to  his  own country,  and  put  to  death  as  a  Catholic  priest, A.D.  1582.  

WILLIAM  (St.)  Bp.  (June  8)  
(12th  cent.)  A  nephew  of  King  Stephen  of England,  who,  on  account  of  his  holiness  of life,  was  elected  Archbishop  of  York.  After patiently  bearing  much  persecution,  he  fell  asleep in  Christ,  a.d.  1154,  in  the  thirteenth  year  of his  Episcopate.  He  was  canonised  A.D.  1227.

(12th  cent.)  Born  in  Piedmont  and  left  an orphan  at  an  early  age,  St.  William,  on  his return  from  a  pilgrimage  to  Compostella,  built himself  a  hermit's  cell  on  Montevergine  (Mons Virgilianus),  on  the  summit  of  the  Apennines, between  Naples  and  Benevento.  Others  soon came  to  share  his  life  of  austere  penance,  and  a monastery  was  quickly  built,  the  cradle  of  a still  existing  Benedictine  Institute.  Before  his death  near  Nusco  (a.d.  1142)  St.  William  had himself  founded  several  monasteries  of  the  new Order.  Montevergine  is  still  a  greatly  frequented place  of  pilgrimage  on  account  of  a  wonderworking picture  of  Our  Blessed  Lady  brought there  from  the  East  in  the  fourteenth  century.  

WILLIAM  (St.)  Bp.  (July  20)  
(13th  cent.)  The  scion  of  an  illustrious  Breton family,  St.  William  was  educated  and  received Holy  Orders  at  St.  Brieux.  He  became  Bishop of  that  See  a.d.  1220.  During  the  fourteen years  of  his  Episcopate  he  showed  a  wonderful spirit  of  kindly  charity  in  dealing  with  his flock,  while  himself  living  a  life  of  singular and  unvarying  austerity.  His  body  was  still incorrupt  when  his  tomb  was  opened  (a.d.  1284), half  a  century  after  his  death.  He  was  canonised (a.d.  1253)  by  Pope  Innocent  IV.  

♦WILLIAM  LACY  (Bl.)  M.  (Aug.  22)  
(16th  cent.)  A  Yorkshire  Catholic,  a  gentleman of  means,  distinguished  for  his  fervent attachment  to  his  religion.  On  the  death  of his  wife,  he  studied  at  Rheims  and  in  Rome,  and returned  as  a  priest  to  England.  He  undertook the  perilous  duty  of  ministering  to  the  Confessors of  the  Faith,  immured  in  the  gaol  at  York ; but  after  two  years  was  detected  and  brought to  trial.  Though  then  a  very  old  man,  he  was put  to  death,  Aug.  22,  A.D.  1582.  

♦WILLIAM  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  2)  
(11th  cent.)  An  Anglo-Saxon,  chaplain  to King  Canute.  Crossing  over  to  Denmark,  he was  there  consecrated  Bishop  and,  aided  in  his work  by  King  Sweyn,  gave  such  proofs  of devotedness  and  piety  that  his  people,  after  his death  (a.d.  1067)  honoured  him  as  a  Saint.  

WILLIBRORD  (St.)  Bp.  (Nov.  7)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Northumbrian  Saint,  a  missionary in  the  present  Holland  and  Belgium, and  the  Founder  of  the  Archbishopric  of Utrecht.  He  died  A.D.  732.

(11th  cent.)  The  nephews  of  the  Bishop  St. Sigfrid,  and  fellow-missionaries  with  him  in Sweden.  In  the  end  they  were  savagely  done to  death  by  the  heathens. Their  history  is 
271 

WINEBALD

(8th  cent.)  The  brother  of  St.  Willebald  and of  St.  Walburga.

(7th  cent.)  The  Patron  Saint  of  North Wales.

She  suffered  death  at  the  hands of  the  tyrant  Caradoc,  at  the  place  since  called Holywell,  from  the  many  miracles  which  even in  our  own  day  bear  witness  to  the  sanctity  of St.  Winifred.  The  Mediaeval  legend  that  St. Winefride  was  by  the  prayers  of  St.  Beuno raised  again  to  life  and  for  many  years  presided over  a  convent  of  nuns,  need  not  be  dwelt  upon. *WINEWALD  (St.)  Abbot,  (April  27)  
(8th  cent.)  The  successor  of  St.  Bercthun as  Abbot  of  Beverley,  where  he  died  A.D.  751, and  was  held  in  honour  as  a  Saint. *WININ  (St.)  Bp.  (Sept.  10)

(6th  cent.)  Born  in  Brittany  of  parents exiled  from  England,  he  was  related  to  SS. Cadfan,  Salomon,  Cybi  and  others.  His monastery  at  Landevenec  near  Brest  was governed  by  him  till  his  death  in  the  first  quarter of  the  sixth  century.  More  than  one  Cornish church  bears  his  name,  so  that  there  is  a  connection between  him  and  that  county  ;  but  the traditions  concerning  him  are  very  contradictory, and  there  may  well  have  been  more than  one  Saint  of  his  name.  

WIRO  (St.)  Bp.  (May  8)  
(8th  cent.)  A  native  of  the  British  Isles, consecrated  Bishop  by  the  Pope  of  the  time.

(11th  cent.)  The  Bishop  of  Worcester  at  the time  of  the  Norman  Conquest.  His  fame  of sanctity  was  so  great  that,  though  an  AngloSaxon,  he  was  allowed  to  retain  his  See.  He  was distinguished  for  his  singular  charity  towards penitent  sinners  and  for  his  self-denying  care  of the  poor.  He  died  a.d.  1095. *WOODHOUSE  (THOMAS)  (Bl.)  M. (June  19)

(1st  cent.)  Converts  to  Christianity,  said  to have  been  made  by  the  Apostles  in  Spain. But  the  traditions  concerning  them  are  doubtful, and  hardly  of  value  to  the  historian.  They may  possibly  have  lived  at  a  much  later date.

(3rd  cent.)  The  successor  of  Pope  St. Stephen.  He  was  put  to  death  with  his deacons,  Felicissimus  and  Agapetus  (a.d.  258), leaving  a  third  deacon,  St.  Laurence,  to  lay down  his  life  for  Christ  three  days  later.  Other Christians,  too,  suffered  with  St.  Xystus,  among them  a  St.  Vincent.  

XYSTUS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (Sept.  1)  
( 1st  cent,  possibly . )  The  first  Bishop  of  Rheims . He  is  assigned  to  the  first  century  by  those  who hold  to  the  old  tradition  of  his  having  been  sent by  the  Apostle  St.  Peter  to  evangelise  Gaul ; but  others  postdate  him  by  a  century  or  more. There  is  no  reliable  historical  record  to  turn  to for  these  questions  of  chronology. 

♦YARCARD  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  24)  
(5th  cent.) A Scottish Saint  ordained  by 
St.  Ternan,  and  like  him  a  missionary  among 
the  Picts.  

YON  (St.)  M.  (Sept.  22)  

Otherwise  St.  JONAS,  which  see. *YTHA  (St.)  V.  (Jan.  15)  

Otherwise  St.  ITA,  which  see.  In  Cornwall St.  Ita  is  known  as  St.  Ide  or  St.  Syth. YVO  (St.)  (May  19)  

Otherwise  St.  IVO,  which  see. *YWY  (St.)  (Oct.  8)  
(7th  cent.)  A  Saint  of  British  birth,  and  a monk  at  Lindisfarne,  where  he  was  ordained deacon  by  St.  Cuthbert.  St.  Ywy  appears  to have  died  in  Brittany  about  the  end  of  the seventh  century.  His  relics  were  translated to  Wilton,  near  Salisbury. 

ZACCH^EUS  (St.)  Bp.  (Aug.  23)  
(2nd  cent.) This  St.  Zacchseus,  or  Zacharias, 
is  reckoned  by  St.  Epiphanius  and  other  Fathers 
as  having  been  the  fourth  Bishop  of  Jerusalem.  

Many  fix  a.d.  116  as  the  date  of  his  death.  

ZACCHffiUS  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  17)  

See  SS.  ALPH^IUS  and  ZACCH.EUS.  

ZACHARIAS  (St.)  Pope.  (March  15)  
(8th  cent.)  A  Greek  who  governed  the Church  from  A.D.  741  to  A.D.  752.  He  was  a man  of  conspicuous  learning  and  piety.  It was  he  who  gave  the  memorable  decision  which replaced  the  Merovingian  by  the  Carolingian dynasty  in  France.  

ZACHARIAS  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (May  26)  
(2nd  cent.)  Traditionally,  it  was  believed that  St.  Zachary  accompanied  St.  Crescentius (Crescens— 2  Tim.  iv.  10),  the  disciple  of  St. Paul,  from  Galatia  to  Gaul,  and  there  succeeded him  as  Bishop  of  Vienne.  Zachary  is  further said  to  have  been  stoned  to  death  under  Trajan (a.d.  106).  But  the  whole  statement  is  much contested.  Jt  is  quite  possible  that  both Zachary  and  Crescens  lived  and  earned  their canonisation  at  a  later  date.  

ZACHARIAS  (St.)  M.  (June  10)  
(Date unknowns The Roman, following 

other  ancient  Martyrologies,  describes  this  St. Zacharias  as  having  suffered  at  Nicomedia,  the Imperial  residence,  like  numberless  other Christians  in  the  great  persecution  under  Diocletian, at  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  century. We  have  no  particulars. ZACHARIAS  (ZECHARIAH)  (St.)  (Sept.  6)  

Prophet.  

(6th  cent.  B.C.)  A  Prophet,  the  son  of Barachias,  who  arose  in  Israel  in  the  eighth month  of  the  second  year  of  King  Darius (B.C.  520),  two  months  after  the  Prophet  Aggeus (Haggai).  Both  contributed  efficaciously  by their  exhortations  to  the  accelerating  the  work of  the  Building  of  the  Second  Temple.  The Messianic  passages  in  the  Book  of  Zacharias  are very  striking. ZACHARY  (ZACHARIAS)  (St.)  Prophet.  (Nov.  5) (1st  cent.)  The  priest  Zacharias  or  Zachary, father  of  St.  John  the  Baptist,  whose  vision  in the  Temple  is  related  in  the  First  Chapter  of St.  Luke's  Gospel,  and  who  was  inspired  to  utter the  magnificent  Canticle,  Benedictus.  The Roman  Martyrology  makes  no  mention  of  his having  finished  his  life  by  dying  in  the  cause  of Christianity ;  but  such  was  the  fixed  opinion of  St.  Epiphanius,  St.  Basil,  St.  Cyril  of  Alexandria and  other  Greek  Fathers.  St.  Jerome, on  the  other  hand,  absolutely  rejects  the  opinion prevalent  in  his  time  that  this  Saint  is  the Zachary  spoken  of  by  Our  Lord  as  killed  between the  Temple  and  the  Altar  (Matt,  xxiii.  35). ZAMAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Jan.  24)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  first  Bishop  of  Bologna (Italy)  of  whom  we  have  any  record.  He  is said  to  have  been  consecrated  by  Pope  St. Dionysius  (a.d.  259-268)  and  to  have  passed away  before  the  beginning  of  the  great  persecution of  Christians  under  Diocletian  towards the  close  of  the  century.  But  many  writers, following  Baronius,  insist  that  Bologna,  by reason  of  its  importance  as  a  city,  must  have had  Bishops  of  its  own  at  a  much  earlier  date than  that  thus  assigned  to  Zamas. ZAMBDAS  (St.)  Bp.  (Feb.  19)  
(4th  cent.)  The  thirty-seventh  Bishop  of Jerusalem.  He  is  said  to  have  converted  to Christianity  the  body  of  Roman  soldiers  later known  as  the  Theban  Legion,  famous  for  their martyrdom  under  Maximian  Herculeus.  St. Zambdas  died  about  a.d.  304. ZANITAS,  LAZARUS,  MAROTAS,  NARSES  and OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (March  27)  

A  group  of  Persian  Martyrs  who  suffered  under the  tyrant  Sapor,  about  the  same  time  as  SS. Jonas  and  Barachias,  that  is,  probably  a.d.  344. ZEBINA  (St.)  M.  (Nov.  13)  

See  SS.  ANTONINUS,  ZEBINA, &c. ZENAIDES, CYRIA, VALERIA and MARCIA (SS.)  MM.  (June  5)  
(Date  unknown.)  St.  Zenaides,  it  would appear,  suffered  for  Christ  at  Constantinople. So  many  miracles  were  wrought  at  her  tomb that  she  came  to  be  called  by  the  Greeks "  Thaumaturga  "  (Wonderworker).  The  tradition concerning  the  other  three  Saints  is  that they  lived  in  the  time  of  Christ  in  Palestine  at Csesarsa,  that  they  were  converted  by  Our Lord  Himself,  and  that,  after  His  Ascension, they  were  among  the  first  Christians  to  shed  their blood  for  Him. ZENAIDES  (ZENAIS)  and  PHILONILLA  (Oct.  11) (SS.)  
(1st  cent.)  Two  holy  women  (perhaps  sisters) related  to  St.  Paul  the  Apostle.  Becoming Christians,  they  spent  their  lives  in  the  doing  of good  works  at  Tarsus  in  Cilicia,  their  native place. ZENAS  (St.)  M.  (June  23)

ZENO 
about;  this  St.  Zeno  are  now  discoverable. Cardinal  Baronius  states  that  the  insertion  of his  name  in  the  Roman  Martyrology  comes from  the  Greek  Menologies.  St.  Zeno  is  in them  described  as  having  been  put  to  the torture  as  a  Christian  and  then  burned  alive. ZENO  (St.)  Bp.,  M.  (April  12)  
(3rd  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  Verona,  who  suffered martyrdom  under  the  Emperor  Gallienus  (a.d. 259  about).  He  has  left  some  Sermons,  which, however,  as  we  now  have  them,  appear  to have  been  mixed  with  others  written  by  a second  Bishop  Zeno,  who  flourished  a  century 
ZENO  (St.)  M.  (April  20)  

See  SS.  VICTOR,  ZOTICUS, Ac.  

ZENO  and  ZENAS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  23)  
(4th cent.)  Zeno, with Zenas, his slave, 
were  together  condemned  and  put  to  death  as 
Christians  in  the  persecution  under  Diocletian 
(A.D.  304).  The  place  where  they  are  registered 
as  having  suffered  is  Philadelphia  in  Arabia.  

By  this  is  probably  meant  the  ancient  Rabbath
Ammon,  a  town  east  of  Palestine.  

ZENO  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (July  9)  
(3rd  cent.) The  Roman  Martyrology  registers 
these  Christian  Martyrs  as  numbering  10,204.  

The  entry  is,  in  fact,  the  record  of  the  wholesale 
massacre of the Christians who had been 
constrained  to  toil  at  the  construction  of  the 
gigantic  Baths  of  Diocletian,  still  prominent 
among  Roman  ruins.  The  St.  Zeno  mentioned 
by  name  will  have  been  their  chief  spokesman, 
or  otherwise conspicuous among  them.  The 
butchery, which doubtless was spread over 
many  days  or  even  weeks,  took  place  at  the 
outset  of  the  great  persecution.  But  a.d.  298, 
the  date  usually  given,  is  hardly  possible  ;  a.d.  

304  is  more  likely.  

ZENO  (SUM.  (July  15)  

See  SS.  PHILIP,  ZENO, &c. ZENO,  CONCORDIUS  and  THEODORE (Sept.  2) (SS.)  MM.  

(4th  cent.) Concordius  and  Theodore  were 
the  'two sons of Zeno  ; and all  three  were 
fervent Christians.  They  suffered  under  the 
Emperor  Julian  at  Nicomedia  (A.D.  362).  

ZENO  and  CHARITON  (SS.)  MM.  (Sept.  3)  
(Date  unknown.)  Martyrs  in the  East, 
chiefly  venerated  by  the  Greeks.  They  appear 
to  have  been  burned  to  death,  perhaps  under 
Diocletian.

ZENO  (St.)  Bp.  (Dec.  20)  
(4th  cent.)  A,  Christian  of  Gaza  in  Palestine.  

In the disasters of  the reign of Julian  the 
Apostate,  this  St.  Zeno  did  his  utmost  to  ensure 
the  escape  of  his  three  cousins,  SS.  Eusebius, 
Nestabus  and  Zeno,  whom,  however,  he  did  not 
succeed  in  saving  from  the  fury  of  the  heathen 
mob.  Later,  he  was  made  Bishop  of  Majuma, 
that  is,  in  effect,  of  Gaza  in  Palestine.  He  died 
about  A.D.  399,  though  there  are  those  who 
contend  that  he  survived  well  into  the  fifth 
century.  

ZENO  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  22)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Roman  soldier,  a  Martyr  under 
Diocletian  (a.d.  304). He  was  beheaded,  after 
the  usual  torture,  at  Nicomedia,  the  Imperial 
residence  on  the  coast  of  Asia  Minor.

(5th  cent.)  A  famous  Bishop  of  Florence, 
friend of St. Ambrose of Milan, and much 
esteemed  by  Pope  St. Damasus. This  Pope 
employed  St.  Zenobius  as  his  Legate  to  Con
274 

stantinople, in connection with the Arian troubles.  The  holy  Bishop  had  great  renown in  his  day  as  a  preacher. He  passed  away  A.D. 407,  being  then  over  ninety  years  of  age. ZENOBIUS  (St.)  M.  (Oct.  29)  
(4th  cent.)  A  priest  of  Antioch  in  Syria  who underwent  exceptionally  horrible  tortures previous  to  his  martyrdom  under  Diocletian (A.D.  304).  He  had  distinguished  himself  in  the past  by  his  assiduity  in  comforting  and  encouraging other  Christian  heroes. ZENOBIUS  and  ZENOBIA  (SS.)  MM.  (Oct.  30)  
(4th  cent.)  A  Bishop  of  the  place  now  called Alessandretta,  on  the  coast  of  Asia  Minor,  who, with  his  sister,  suffered  martyrdom,  probably under  Diocletian  (a.d.  304),  though  some  insist that  the  date  was  a.d.  280,  during  one  of  the short  and  troubled  reigns  preceding  that  of  the great  persecutor  of  Christianity.

See  SS.  LUCIAN,  METROBIUS,  Ac. ZEPHYRINUS  (St.)  Pope,  M.  (Aug.  26)  
(3rd  cent.)  The  successor  of  Pope  St.  Victor I.  He  occupied  St.  Peter's  Chair  for  ten  years, and  received  the  crown  of  martyrdom  during the  reign  of  the  brutal  Emperor  Heliogabalus (A.D.  219). ZETICUS  (St.)  M.  (Dec.  23)

(13th  cent.)  An  Italian  Saint,  recognised  as the  special  Patron  of  domestic  servants.  She passed  a  long  life  sanctifying  her  soul  as  a household  drudge,  often  harshly  treated  by  her employers,  and  suffering  frequent  ill-usage  at the  hands  of  her  fellow-servants.  She  died April  27,  A.D.  1271. ZOE  (St.)  M.  (May  2)

DIOCLES  (SS.)  MM.  (May  24)  
(Date  unknown.) Nothing  is  known  of  them.  

The  Roman  Martyrology  puts  them  down  as 
having  suffered  in  Istria  ; but  the  Bollandists 
think  that  one  should  rather  read  Syria.  

ZOILUS  and  OTHERS  (SS.)  MM.  (June  27)  
(Date  unknown.)  A  band  of  twenty  Christians put  to  death  for  their  Faith  at  Cordova  in Spain,  in  one  of  the  early  persecutions,  probably in  that  under  Diocletian  at  the  beginning  of  the fourth  century. ZOSIMA  (St.)  M.  (July  15)

his salvation and  that he therefore has no 
essential need of God's grace.  St. Zosimus
