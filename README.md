# Books of Saints  

I was having a difficult time finding text versions of books about Christian saints that were both copyright free and edited enough for easy searching & reading. 
Most of what I found had been sloppily scanned and OCR'd, making them hard to read and Internet unfriendly.  

This repository will hold my work on one or more volumes as I work through editing.  

I have started on the early 20th century "The Book Of Saints: A Dictionary Of Servants Of God Canonized By The Catholic Church."  From: https://archive.org/details/bookofsaintsdict00stau/page/n13/mode/2up
