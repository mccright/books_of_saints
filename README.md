# Books of Saints  

I was having a difficult time finding text versions of books about Christian saints that were both copyright free and edited enough for easy searching & reading.  
Most of what I found had been sloppily scanned and OCR'd, making them hard to read and Internet unfriendly.  

This repository will hold my work on one or more volumes as I work through editing.  

I have started on the early 20th century "The Book Of Saints: A Dictionary Of Servants Of God Canonized By The Catholic Church." (314 pages)  From: [https://archive.org/details/bookofsaintsdict00stau/page/n13/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/bookofsaintsdict00stau/page/n13/mode/2up).  I am currently reformatting to support line wrapping on various size screens/readers as well as removing page headers & page numbers, as well as some of the scanning artifacts.  
* The *in process* version is at: [The_Book_of_saints_1921](The_Book_of_saints_1921.md)  

I have also started on a mid-19th century "Foxe's Book of Martyrs..." (446 pages) from:  [https://archive.org/details/FoxesBookOfMartyrs_852/page/n5/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/FoxesBookOfMartyrs_852/page/n5/mode/2up). I am currently reformatting to support line wrapping on various size screens/readers as well as removing page headers & page numbers, as well as some of the scanning artifacts.
